{% raw %}In this intimate and sincere cover of the U2 classic from their indelible album â€˜The Joshua Treeâ€™, GuruGanesha Singh felt called to share this song as it inspired him to reflect on his life, love, the certainty he had as a young man, and the doubts he has gained with age.<br /><br />Accompanied by only acoustic guitars and pedal steel, GuruGaneshaâ€™s delivery is unguarded and honest about the hopes and dreams that fell flat and ran afoul, but there is a spark of hope in his voice, clearly asking himself to keep the faith and stay true to his heart.<br /><br />Listen &amp; Download: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://l.spiritvoyage.info/guruganesha-singh/still-havent-found-looking-for">https://l.spiritvoyage.info/guruganesha-singh/still-havent-found-looking-for</a><br /><br />Stay connected with GuruGanesha<br />ðŸŽ¸ Spotify <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://link.spiritvoyage.com/guruganesha">https://link.spiritvoyage.com/guruganesha</a><br />ðŸŽ¸ Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/guruganeshaband/">https://www.instagram.com/guruganeshaband/</a><br />ðŸŽ¸ Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/theguruganeshaband">https://www.facebook.com/theguruganeshaband</a><br />ðŸŽ¸ Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/guruganeshaband">https://twitter.com/guruganeshaband</a><br />ðŸŽ¸ Website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.guruganeshaband.com/">https://www.guruganeshaband.com/</a><br /><br />Credits<br />Produced and Mixed by Phoenix Quinn<br />Recorded at Dragonfly Recordings<br />Pedal Steel by Dean Parks<br />Mastered by Reuben Cohen at Lurssen Mastering{% endraw %}
