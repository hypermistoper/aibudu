{% raw %}So the Frost Came (a little early in my opinion)  I am digging up my Giant and bringing it inside...  this type of Colocasia Does not go completely dorment... you will need to make sure it has some light during the winter... it should grow slower...  but it still grows :)<br /><br />Check out my Facebook page - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/#!/PlantznThings?fref=ts">http://www.facebook.com/#!/PlantznThings?fref=ts</a><br /><br />Video editing Software used for this video is (VideoStudio Pro x4) By Corel{% endraw %}
