{% raw %}The idea of learning Torah is to be able to learn what to do. Laboring in the Torah is not simply dealing with convoluted concepts. Rather, the laboring leads us to a different fulfillment of the mitzvah we are dealing with. Since we are learning for the purpose of doing, the quality of our learning will enhance the quality of our doing. If we labor in the Torah and our understanding of the depth of the Torah is enhanced - its not only our understanding of the Torah that is enhanced - its the laboring that leads to a different kind of action. Our actions are the product of our laboring. Join Yehezqel Italqi as he explains how the Torah teaches we have The Power to Create.<br /><br />To support Sulam Ya'aqov Inc. donations can be sent via our website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://seventyfacesoftorah.com/donate/">https://seventyfacesoftorah.com/donate/</a><br /><br />Follow Sulam Ya'aqov on Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/sulamyaaqovi...">https://www.facebook.com/sulamyaaqovi...</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shivimpanim.....">https://www.instagram.com/shivimpanim.....</a>{% endraw %}
