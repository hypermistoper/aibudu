{% raw %}Training A Horse To Lengthen In Trot - In this video, I explain how I teach my horse to do trot lengthening. Before you can teach your horse Medium trot or Extended trot he must understand how to lengthen his trot. This is part of basic dressage horse training and dressage rider training. It was something that I had difficulty doing and in the video, I explain why I had difficulty and then show you how to train your horse. I hope you enjoy it <br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏è  No obligation whatsoever, but if I have brought you value and you would like to donate to support this channel, I would appreciate it.
