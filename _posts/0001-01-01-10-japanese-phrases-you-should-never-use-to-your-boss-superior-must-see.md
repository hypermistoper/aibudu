{% raw %}For those of you who are studying Japanese, I’m pretty sure that the idea of 敬語 keigo is the most difficult and tiresome part of it. Knowing that there is a strict line between the kind of language you can use to your friends and family, and the language you should use to the elderly, your boss, or strangers, is very very important. No matter how many kanji and phrases you learn, if you use them at the wrong time, there is a chance that you might make the other person feel unpleasant or uncomfortable.<br /><br />So today, as a man who has worked in three different Japanese companies before, I will explain to you ten phrases that you should avoid using to your boss or an elderly.<br /><br />Quite a lot of young Japanese new workers make mistakes with these phrases too, and they will probably be scolded, or if worse, may be ignored and just quietly lose trust as “a person without basic language skills.” Some of these phrases might make you think, “What?! I’ve studied that so many times! You shouldn’t use it?”<br /><br />In the end of the video,I will introduce a few phrases that I always use and recommend you using, in order to have a decent relationship with your bosses at work. This video is recommended to those who are willing to study or work in Japan someday, and hopefully will be helpful when you interact with Japanese people.<br /><br />[Time codes]<br />0:00 Let's START!<br />2:13 1.ご苦労 gokurō<br />3:30 2.一応 ichiō / 多分 tabun<br />4:28 3.助かる tasukaru<br />5:12 4.分かりません wakarimasen<br />6:08 5.いいですか idesuka<br />6:58 6.了解 ryōkai<br />8:10 7.なるほど naruhodo<br />9:07 8.がんばって ganbatte<br />10:10 9.ごめんなさい gomennasai<br />11:30 10.もちろん mochiron<br />12:41 The 3 magical phrases<br />14:50 Today’s conclusion<br />18:34 “Omake” talk<br /><br />▼Who is Shogo?
