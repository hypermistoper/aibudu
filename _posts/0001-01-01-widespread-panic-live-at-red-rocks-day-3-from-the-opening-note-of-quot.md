{% raw %}From the opening note of &quot;Wondering&quot; all the way through to the set closing &quot;Conrad,&quot; the band owned the opportunity. Sandwiched in between the opener and a divine &quot;C. Brown,&quot; a very leggy &quot;Surprise Valley&quot; overwhelmed the crowd with an almost-anthemic presence. &quot;Kiss the mountain air we breathe&quot; sounds good standing anywhere, but beneath &quot;ship&quot; and &quot;Creation&quot; rocks it evoked magic. All weekend the boys in the band had worn smiling faces, but early in the day it was easy to see that Sunday &quot;Funday&quot; was going to be enchanting.  Words can difficultly describe the bands energy on this last day. As the band masterfully wielded a &quot;Bowlegged Woman&quot; into &quot;Lawyers, Guns and Money,&quot; it started to become apparent that the second set would be no ordinary picnic. Call them fan favorites, Halloween treats, illustrious tour gems, whatever you want, but don't expect to hear &quot;Mama Told Me Not to Come,&quot; &quot;Knocking Around the Zoo&quot; and &quot;Walk On&quot; in consecutive order too often. The only seemingly botched moment in the whole afternoon was a &quot;Guilded Splinters&quot; that by most standards was still great but just seemed to be lost for a bit before being revitalized by some.{% endraw %}
