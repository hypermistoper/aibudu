{% raw %}Pop music is a form of popular music that is commonly sung and played using electric instruments. The genre is characterized by the common use of chord progressions and the rhythmic accompaniment of percussion instruments, e.g. drums. The genre emerged in the 1950s and 1960s, and was popularised by The Beatles.<br /><br />#pop<br />#jessegallagher<br />#bright <br /><br />To break the ice press this link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/35cI8tr">https://bit.ly/35cI8tr</a><br /><br />You may ask why there are many repetitions of the same song? Well to enjoy the candy you need to eat several pieces. To really enjoy the song you may listen to it a couple of times. <br />On a mobile browser, I find it difficult to set the repeat option, for some reason, so I created these 1h song sessions. Pick a song and enjoy your hour.<br /><br />! 1 Hour Wave{% endraw %}
