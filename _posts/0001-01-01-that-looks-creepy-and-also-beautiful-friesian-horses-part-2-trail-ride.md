{% raw %}Trail ride with QueenüëëUniek and Waloubet. Uniek has not been in the forest for a long time. This is related to her osteoarthritis. But because she's doing so well now. It is time to go to the forest again? Part 2<br /><br />Earlier I made a poll for you. With the following question:<br />I want to edit a video of a trail ride with QueenüëëUniek and Waloubet in the forest. How long should this video be?<br />Almost 50% chose: As long as possible, I watch everything!!! <br />Almost 30% chose: About 10 minutes is okay for me<br /><br />And that's why I thought... I'll make a few videos, about 10 minutes long. And I make it a playlist. And then everyone can decide for themselves which videos they want to see.
