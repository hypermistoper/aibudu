{% raw %}When parents think back to their childhood fears, being afraid of the dark was most likely one of them. The darkness lets our imagination fill our surroundings with the scariest of thoughts. But PlayKids wants to help you with your own children's fear of the dark with a little turtle, named Theo, who gets scared of the dark too! In this original PlayKids song, Theo discovers that the things he thinks are scary are actually not so scary after all! This “I Love to Learn” episode will help your children see through the darkness and figure out that there is nothing to fear when the lights go out!<br /><br />I'M NOT SO SCARED:<br /><br />I’m not so scared anymore, not so scared<br />I’m not so scared anymore, not so scared<br />My mind will trick me that something thing is there <br />But I’m much more brave now I know I’m not scared<br />I thought there was a monster under my bed<br />I’m not so scared<br />But then I found out is was only in my head<br />no nothing’s there<br />Is that a monster in my closet, making noise?<br />I’m not so scared<br />But then I found out it was one of my toys<br />no nothing’s there<br />I’m not so scared anymore, not so scared<br />I’m not so scared anymore, not so scared<br />My mind will trick me that something is there<br />But I’m much more brave now I know I’m not scared<br />I saw a spooky shadow on my wall<br />I’m not so scared<br />It’s just a tree branch after all<br />no nothing’s there<br />What is that noise I can hear outside?<br />I’m not so scared<br />It’s only the wind I don’t have to hide.<br />no nothing’s there<br />I’m not so scared anymore, not so scared<br />I’m not so scared anymore, not so scared<br />(Theo talks)<br />Your imagination is an amazing thing, but some times it can fool you. Always remember, there is no such things as monsters.<br />And if you don’t like the dark, sleep with a night light!<br />We can be brave buddies...together!<br /><br />---------<br /><br />Watch more PlayKids video playlists at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://plkids.tv/PlaylistForKids">http://plkids.tv/PlaylistForKids</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to PlayKids for new videos!  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://plkids.tv/PKsubscribe">http://plkids.tv/PKsubscribe</a><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br />Please comment and share this video with your friends!<br />--------------------------------------------------------------<br /> <br />PlayKids features music for kids, learning videos, easy crafts for kids, brain break videos for teachers, nursery rhymes, kids songs, funny songs, STEAM and STEM crafts for kids, and more!<br /><br />Including: <br />+ The animated series Junior on the Job, where kids learn about different jobs in their neighborhood!  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://plkids.tv/JuniorOnTheJob">http://plkids.tv/JuniorOnTheJob</a><br /><br />+ Learning songs for kids: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://plkids.tv/KidsSongsThatTeach">http://plkids.tv/KidsSongsThatTeach</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://plkids.tv/TeachersToolbox">http://plkids.tv/TeachersToolbox</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://plkids.tv/AnimalSongsSocialSkills">http://plkids.tv/AnimalSongsSocialSkills</a><br /><br />+ Crafts for kids: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://plkids.tv/CraftsForKids1">http://plkids.tv/CraftsForKids1</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://plkids.tv/CraftsForKids2">http://plkids.tv/CraftsForKids2</a><br /><br />+ Dance songs for kids: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://plkids.tv/DanceSongsLetsMove">http://plkids.tv/DanceSongsLetsMove</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://plkids.tv/BrainBreakSongs">http://plkids.tv/BrainBreakSongs</a><br /><br />+ Animal songs for kids: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://plkids.tv/AnimalSongsSocialSkills">http://plkids.tv/AnimalSongsSocialSkills</a><br /><br />+ Stories for kids: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://plkids.tv/StoriesForKids">http://plkids.tv/StoriesForKids</a><br /><br />+ ABC songs for kids: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://plkids.tv/ABCSong">http://plkids.tv/ABCSong</a><br /><br />+ Nursery Rhymes for kids: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://plkids.tv/nurseryrhymesongs">http://plkids.tv/nurseryrhymesongs</a><br /> <br /><br />Visit the Official PlayKids YouTube Channel! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playkidsapp">https://www.youtube.com/playkidsapp</a> <br />Visit our website! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://playkids.com/">https://playkids.com/</a> <br />Follow us on Google Plus! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/106731000536924838975">https://plus.google.com/106731000536924838975</a><br />Like our Facebook Fan Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PlayKidsUS/">https://www.facebook.com/PlayKidsUS/</a><br /> <br />To access a LOT more fun including your favorite kid shows from Disney, Pocoyo, Om Nom Stories, Lottie Dottie Chicken, Stella and Sam, Babar, The Wiggles, HooplaKidz, Sesame Street and more, download our app! <br />Apple iTunes Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://plkids.tv/pk-ios">http://plkids.tv/pk-ios</a> <br />Google Play: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://plkids.tv/pk-android">http://plkids.tv/pk-android</a> <br /> <br />© PlayKids.
