{% raw %}With the first round of the DH world cup taking place in Lourdes, France this weekend I decided to get my DH bike out, head to Wales and send some of the biggest jumps, fastest trails and scariest lines I could find...<br /><br />This trip begins at Cannop cycle centre in the Forest of Dean where we shred some steep black mtb downhill trails, sending gaps, drops and jumps at full speed as well as some crazy steep red bull rampage lines.. We then headed over to bikepark Wales to hit some black trails finishing the day off perfectly!<br /><br />KARA'S LATEST VLOG:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvQKUFVpyuzB39Vm9lRLwqg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvQKUFVpyuzB39Vm9lRLwqg</a>{% endraw %}
