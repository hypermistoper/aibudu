Herbs, Roots, Barks, Etc. is the first album from Helen Turner, Iain Black and Marek Funkas since 2016‚Äôs ‚ÄòTil The Dawn, and the first featuring Steve Weaver on drums. Ten essential songs - soulful, heavy, groovy, bluesy, rockin'!<br /><br />Helen Turner, on vocals, from Glasgow, Scotland, is &quot;the real deal&quot; according to Classic Rock magazine, &quot;brilliant&quot; and &quot;in a different class&quot; according to Classic Rock: The Blues, and simply &quot;wonderful&quot; according to Blues Matters. Beautiful vocals on record and even better live.<br /><br />Iain Black, on guitar, has long been Helen's musical partner. They've had their songs and performances nominated for British Blues Awards, and an album voted a top album of the year by Classic Rock: The Blues magazine.<br /><br />Marek Funkas, on bass, hooked up with Helen and Iain to form Born Healer in 2015, and things immediately clicked! Marek is an in-demand musician and regularly deps for major international touring artists , and performs with his own band, Laba.<br /><br />Steve Weaver, on drums, joined Born Healer in January 2019 and fitted in super quickly to the Born Healer family. Steve brings a wealth of live performance experience and a real spark and energy to live shows. He even fronts his own AC/DC tribute band!<br /><br />(Andy Jones played drums in Born Healer from the start 'til 2019. We wish Andy all the best).<br /><br />üéß Don‚Äôs Tunes is about the music.
