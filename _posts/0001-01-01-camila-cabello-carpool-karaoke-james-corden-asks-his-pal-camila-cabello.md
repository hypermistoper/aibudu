{% raw %}James Corden asks his pal Camila Cabello to help him carpool through the LA traffic and the two sing her big hits from &quot;Havana&quot; to &quot;Don't Go Yet&quot; to &quot;Bam Bam.&quot; And James asks Camila about both the journey her parents took to create a new life in America for their daughter. And before James hooks Camila up to a lie detector test, she admits her love for Harry Styles is what inspired her to audition for &quot;The X Factor.&quot;<br /><br />More Late Late Show:<br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/CordenYouTube">http://bit.ly/CordenYouTube</a><br />Watch Full Episodes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1ENyPw4">http://bit.ly/1ENyPw4</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://on.fb.me/19PIHLC">http://on.fb.me/19PIHLC</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1Iv0q6k">http://bit.ly/1Iv0q6k</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/latelategram">http://bit.ly/latelategram</a><br /><br />Watch The Late Late Show with James Corden weeknights at 12:35 AM ET/11:35 PM CT.
