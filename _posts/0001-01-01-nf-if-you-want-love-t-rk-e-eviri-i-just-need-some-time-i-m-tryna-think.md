{% raw %}I just need some time, I'm tryna think straight<br />I just need a moment in my own space<br />Ask me how I'm doin', I'll say &quot;okay, &quot; yeah<br />But ain't that what we all say?<br />Sometimes I think back to the old days<br />In the pointless conversations with the old me<br />Yeah, back when my momma used to hold me<br />I wish somebody woulda told me<br />If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain<br />If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change<br />If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away<br />If you want love, if you want love<br />Yeah, as a kid I used to think life<br />Is moving so slow, I watch it go by<br />Look out the window on my bus ride<br />I thought the world was so small, through my closed eyes<br />I've always tried to control things<br />In the end that's what controls me<br />Maybe that's why I'm controllin'<br />I wish somebody woulda told me<br />If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain<br />If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change<br />If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away<br />If you want love, if you want love<br />The older I get, I feel like I'm always tryna save time<br />Talkin' to the voices in my head, they make me think twice<br />Tellin' me it doesn't mean it's wrong because it feels right<br />I'm scared that one day I wake up and wonder where the time go<br />Talk about the past like it's the present while I rock slow<br />I'll sit in the living room and laugh with kids of my own<br />And tell 'em<br />If you want love, you gon' have to go through the pain<br />I wish you woulda told me<br />If you want love, you gon' have to learn how to change<br />I wish somebody woulda told me<br />If you want trust, you gon' have to give some away<br />You gon' have to give<br />If you want love, if you want love<br />If you want love, if you want love{% endraw %}
