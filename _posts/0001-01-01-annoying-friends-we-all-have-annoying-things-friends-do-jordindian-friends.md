{% raw %}Friends add colours to our lives, no doubt! They are practically family, and like every family, we always have some annoying characters. This friendship day we pay tribute to those friends who get on our nerves all the time, yet we do love them because they're after all a huge part of our lives. <br /><br />Also, in light of friendships day, we have a contest running. Head on to our Instagram @thejordindian and check out the latest post and tag all your friends. Make sure you share your colourful stories with friends in the comments section along with the hashtags #BreezerVivid and #LiveLifeInColour and get a chance to win Breezer goodies.<br /><br />Happy Friendship Day!! :)<br /><br />LIKE SHARE &amp; SUBSCRIBE FOR MORE <br /><br />Production: Do Creative Labs<br /><br />Cast:<br />Tanviya Sapru<br />Praveen Raj Devasagayam<br />Bharath M Devaraj <br />Neelam Issac Deepak <br />Varshita Ramesh<br />Sunilino Matthew<br />Sachin Vinay<br />Zelda The Kitten <br />Que The Pup <br /><br />Manager - Anuj SM<br /><br />Recording Studio: MarkMyWords.inc<br /><br />Poster Credits - Siddharth Mohandas<br /><br />Special Thanks:<br /> Saad Pasha<br />Sanky's Burger House <br /><br />Instagram:<br />@thejordindian<br />@naseralazzeh<br />@vineethbeepkumar<br /><br />Twitter:<br />@thejordindian{% endraw %}
