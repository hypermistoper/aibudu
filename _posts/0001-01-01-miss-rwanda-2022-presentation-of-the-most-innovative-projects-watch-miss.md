For the second year running, #BK will award the contestant with the Most Innovative idea. It was a busy afternoon on Thursday as all the finalists pitched their projects before a panel of Judges.<br /><br />The jury was comprised of; <br /><br />- Dadi Niwenjye / Strategy and Research Manager at Bank of Kigali.<br />- Nicole Kamanzi / Regional Branch Manager in charge of Bank of Kigali branches. <br />- Emmanuel Gashagaza / Senior Business Advisor and Project Manager - Inkomoko<br /><br />Through Bank of Kigali's partnership with Inkomoko, the winner of #MissRwanda2022 Most Innovative Project will acquire training, consultancy and business advisory, to help her fully understand the concept of the project and the impact it will bring to the community.<br /><br />The winner of the #MostInnovativeProject will be announced this Saturday, during the Grande Finale. She will be receiving a monthly salary from Bank of Kigali, as their Brand Ambassador.<br /><br />The Most Innovative Project criteria are different from the Beauty with a Purpose projects the contestants present during Province auditions. These projects (Most Innovative) are mainly  entrepreneurial &amp; creative so that when they get funds they will be able to generate income.<br /><br />Last year, Bank of Kigali pledged Frw24 million to support the Most Innovative Project. Hense Teta Musana won the prize through her project of producing environmentally-friendly paper cups.<br /><br />When BK says 'Financially Transforming Lives', this is what they mean!{% endraw %}
