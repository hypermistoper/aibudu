{% raw %}The Complex Sneakers Podcast is co-hosted by Joe La Puma, Brendan Dunne, and Matt Welty. This week the three guys discuss the best and worst moments over the history of high-fashion sneakers. From the Gucci Tennis 84 to the Prada Americas Cup to the Dior x Air Jordan 1 and Louis Vuitton x Nike Air Force 1s. And everything in between. The guys also talk about Mache's first New Balance collaboration and whether or not it's OK to eat six-day-old pizza.<br /><br />Looking for the Complex Sneakers Podcast Dad Hats?
