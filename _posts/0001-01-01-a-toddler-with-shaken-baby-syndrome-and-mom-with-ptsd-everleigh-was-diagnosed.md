{% raw %}Everleigh was diagnosed with shaken baby syndrome at three months old after being shaken violently. Leah, her mom, developed PTSD from the incident which was caused by a person that she trusted. It is uncertain how shaken baby syndrome will impact Everleigh's future, but Leah wants her daughter to know that she will love her no matter what. <br /><br />SBSK Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/SBSK">https://www.patreon.com/SBSK</a><br /><br />SBSK's Socials: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/specialbooksbyspecialkids">http://www.instagram.com/specialbooksbyspecialkids</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/chrisulmer">https://twitter.com/chrisulmer</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/specialbooksbyspecialkids">https://www.facebook.com/specialbooksbyspecialkids</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sbsk">https://www.reddit.com/r/sbsk</a>{% endraw %}
