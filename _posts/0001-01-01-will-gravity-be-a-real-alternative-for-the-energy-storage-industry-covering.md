Yes, gravity holds entire solar systems together ‚Äî which is something no other force, no matter how strong, can do. But gravity also only attracts, it doesn't have a negative version that can push out. That's why it's so easy for us to defeat gravity every day. If you've ever picked anything from the ground, you've defeated gravity, temporarily of course, but you get the gist. <br /><br />So if gravity is so weak, how can it be a real alternative for the energy storage industry? How can it even store energy, since it's merely a force that attracts and does nothing else? <br /><br />To learn the answer to that question, you've just got to be patient. <br /><br />In this video, we'll be checking out how gravity, the weakest force we know, might actually be a real and useful alternative to the energy storage industry. Don‚Äôt forget to hit the like and sub buttons for the algorithm, will ya? Great! <br /><br />When generating energy, there are three primary questions engineers tend to ask themselves. The first question is how to generate the energy itself, then how to store it, and finally, how to deliver it. <br /><br />As you might expect, each stage of energy production already has viable green options. For example, there are a lot of ways to generate energy. Whether it's through a wind turbine or a solar panel, it doesn't matter ‚Äî we just know that we can generate energy. <br /><br />___________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />ü§© The Tesla Domain is the Number 1 channel to go when you want to be up to date with the latest Tesla news, rumors, and insights.
