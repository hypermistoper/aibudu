{% raw %}Tennessee and Georgia Southern played the second game of their 3 game series that opened up the 2022 College Baseball Season.<br /><br />Covering sports in a unique way since 2018. <br /><br />If you’re looking for a place that can educate you with commentary on top of high quality edits, this is the place for you! I’ve covered Baseball (MLB, NCAA, LLWS), Football (NFL, NCAA), Basketball (NBA, NCAA), Hockey (NHL), Softball (NCAA), and much more!<br /><br />I make my videos on the HP Spectre x360. I use Adobe Premiere Rush to edit, which allows me to commentate and efficiently splice up clips in a high quality way.<br /><br />One of my favorite accomplishments is revolutionizing the way sports channels create thumbnails. I started making them with team logos on the left, and a game snapshot on the right, and I’ve gotten almost all of my video views with that style.<br /><br />I have a combined 4 years of experience as a Baseball &amp; Basketball Play by Play announcer, which is where I learned my skills for commentary/breakdowns.<br /><br />Twitter: @WheelsYT{% endraw %}
