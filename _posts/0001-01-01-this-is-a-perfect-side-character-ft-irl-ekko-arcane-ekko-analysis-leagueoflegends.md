{% raw %}#LeagueOfLegends #Netflix <br /><br />Whose side is Ekko on?  Why is his intro so weird? What’s up with the hourglass on his face? Great side characters use EVERY LITTLE DETAIL available to them in their characterization.  Ekko is Arcane’s best side character because of how packed and powerful his characterization is. Every detail of his design and his actions are about building a strong identity, and it’s all done subtly enough that Arcane viewers who don’t wish to pay any closer attention to Ekko or his community don’t feel any pressure to -- exactly as it should be. <br /><br />0:00 - BIG Glaring Question<br />1:51 - Hero Villain Trifecta<br />2:24 - Arcane's Binary<br />3:29 - Ekko the 3rd Option<br />8:55 - Ekko &amp; Powder<br />13:44 - IRL Ekko Story <br /><br />Support me on Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/schnee1">https://www.patreon.com/schnee1</a><br /><br />Read my comic Minor Champion!
