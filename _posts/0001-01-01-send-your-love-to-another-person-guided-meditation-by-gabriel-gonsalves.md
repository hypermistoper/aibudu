And after a while, you will start experiencing the many benefits and healing effects of having a whole world smilin’ with you.<br /><br />But how do you do this? How do you send love to another person? How can you direct this love-heart energy, either to yourself or others? How can you actually send love to others after you lovingly say to them ‘I send you all of my love’. <br /><br />How to Send Love to Someone you Love<br /><br />1) Focus your attention on your heart.<br />2) Breath into your heart deeply, evenly, and rhythmically.<br />3) Think of something or someone who evokes feelings of love and appreciation.<br />4) Put on a BIG smile, and allow the feelings of love and appreciation to fill your body.<br />5) Radiate the energy-feeling of love and appreciation to the person you love. <br />6) Be sure to keep smiling, and that you’re feeling the feeling you’re sending. (If you’re not feeling it, you ain't sending it!)<br />7) Feel appreciation for yourself as you send this energy out to others.<br /><br />Remember, you can’t give others something you don’t already have, so the key to this process is that you actually feel the feelings of love and appreciation first. If you don’t, you won’t experience the results.  <br /><br />The more you practice feeling and sending love, the easier it becomes. And after a while, you will start experiencing the many benefits and healing effects of having a whole world smilin’ with you.<br /><br />---------------<br /><br />Music Credits:<br />Avec Soin - Romance by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100860">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100860</a><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a>{% endraw %}
