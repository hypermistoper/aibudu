{% raw %}Of all the games you could've played to fuck this A thousand ways I could've done the same<br />How is it we came back from the edge Something brought this love back from the dead<br />Now you're holding me more Holding me more like the first time First time again<br />I thought you forgot<br />I thought you forgot what it feels like Feels like<br />Whatever you did<br />With whomever it is<br />Thank you for making me feel like this<br />When you came here pleading independence Songbird eyes singing me away<br />Promising it wouldn't make a difference<br />Cause you couldn't work us out try as you may<br />Who is it that came and made it clearer Cause I will ending up thanking him one day{% endraw %}
