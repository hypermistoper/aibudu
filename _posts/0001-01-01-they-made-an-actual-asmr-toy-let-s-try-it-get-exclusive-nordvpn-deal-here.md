I feel like whenever something hits The Mainstream there's usually a lot of room for missing the mark - but, without spoiling too much, I thought the box was actually pretty good!!!! The mic definitely didn't work for me how they intended unless I'm missing something, and it mostly centered around slime (which to me CAN be ASMR but also has a whole niche /subgenre of its own) - but the things included made genuinely nice sounds! I'm not sure if it WAS intentional, but the plastic packaging was also very soft and not harsh sounding which could have been a huge oversight! <br /><br />IMO there is actually a huge chance to make ASMR-friendly products, down to the packaging and materials used. It's always nice to accidentally come across products that are great for ASMR, but this was the first time it was *for* it! <br /><br />Sleep well, lemme know what you think!! Crackin up at the mini mic sounds... some of it sounded SO GOOD!?!!?! It's nicely suited for louder sounds - I think I'm so used to having my gain up and being so careful to be gentle/quiet.... I should modify it sometimes to capture louder sounds that still sound good. <br />Although when I'm using the mini mic, when I'm whispering, that's being captured through the AKG's lololol. It couldn't pick up my whispering that well from the angle I had it at! <br />ALSO - Vest did edit the sound of the mini mic a bit like he does with my other audio too :D <br /><br />Also I say it in the video too; but it was storming heavily when I filmed this so don't be alarmed! The sound are coming from my end, not yours, ha! I think it made it kinda cozy though c:<br /><br />~Gibi :)<br /><br />üéµNew Spotify tracks every Monday! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/56r9ccCkwBCSDHIYviwhcv">https://open.spotify.com/artist/56r9ccCkwBCSDHIYviwhcv</a><br />And Apple Music! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/gibi-asmr/1373500921">https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/gibi-asmr/1373500921</a><br />AAAND Soundcloud! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/gibiasmr">https://soundcloud.com/gibiasmr</a><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />My upload schedule:<br />‚ñ∫New Spotify audio every Monday<br />‚ñ∫ASMR YouTube Video every Tuesday at 6pm Eastern<br />‚ñ∫ASMR YouTube Video every Thursday at 6pm Eastern<br />‚ñ∫Sponsored ASMR Video Every Saturday at 6pm Eastern<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I donate regularly to The Brain and Behavior Research Foundation.
