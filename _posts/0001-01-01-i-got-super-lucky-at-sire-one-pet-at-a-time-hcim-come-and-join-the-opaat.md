However, it's not as simple as that I'll be sticking to one pet grind at a time untill I hit pet drop rate before moving on!<br /><br />This means I'll have to strategise my account in what boss drops I want to gather in a specific order.  <br /><br />In this episode 'The abyssal Appointment' - I take on the abyssal sire.  With a nice pet on offer 'the abyssal orphan' and the useful abyssal bludgeon, it was time to take on the sire and test my luck! <br /><br />THE RULES OF THE SERIES have changed, they were previously confusing and had too many requirments such as the wildcard system and the forfeit system, BUT NOW it's a more streamlined system where I pick a boss/pet and stick to it until drop rate.  Hope you enjoy the new OPAAT rules!<br /><br />Rules:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/B0V6U6Cm">https://pastebin.com/B0V6U6Cm</a><br /><br />Play Old School RuneScape (OSRS)  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://oldschool.runescape.com">https://oldschool.runescape.com</a><br /><br /><br />TheSkulled: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3NPPMYWrCH4oCFeKRf9Ltw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3NPPMYWrCH4oCFeKRf9Ltw</a><br /><br /><br />Editor: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Whit_Edit">https://twitter.com/Whit_Edit</a>{% endraw %}
