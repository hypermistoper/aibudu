{% raw %}This week starts off with a trip over to my 82 year old dads shop for some help breaking down my truck tires so I can replace some worn valve stems.<br />I also prime and paint my wheels and install some awesome 3&quot; stainless steel exhaust. I practice the pie cutting method in order to get the bends I need to get around the transfer case .<br /> Consider supporting Steve Summers YouTube channel <br />Peanut Coffee Mugs/New design Tee shirts<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/en/steve-summers?">https://teespring.com/en/steve-summers?</a><br />New design/Tee spring<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://steve-summers-3.creator-spring.com/listing/new-steve-summers">https://steve-summers-3.creator-spring.com/listing/new-steve-summers</a><br />Amazon Wish List<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/genericItemsPage/27M0H2MY0WC0Y">https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/genericItemsPage/27M0H2MY0WC0Y</a><br /><br />Shop Build Fund Raiser<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-repair-the-shop?utm_source=customer&amp;utm_medium=copy_link-tip&amp;utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet">https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-repair-the-shop?utm_source=customer&amp;utm_medium=copy_link-tip&amp;utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet</a> <br /><br /> Huge thanks to all my supporters who make all this  possible, If you would like to support the channel please consider joining my patreon page.
