{% raw %}Overt racism is easy to identify. But what about unconscious bias – soft prejudices that we all have, but of which we are basically unaware? In today’s heated social and global climate, this lack of awareness can deeply impact your professional and personal life, as well as the way you unintentionally communicate and think. It can even have serious economic ramifications.<br /><br />This provocative talk will take a deep dive into the subject, where you will confront your own biases and see how you – regardless of race, status, income or education – have been a victim of unconscious bias. Jennefer is an in-demand speaker on implicit bias, gender-based communication styles, personal branding, social media and public relations topics. The Pentagon, The Brookings Institution, PA Conference for Women, Brown Brothers Harriman and Columbia University are among the many prestigious venues where she has presented. Jennefer is also an instructor at NYC’s 92Y. She is an experienced chief executive officer (The Boreland Group) with a demonstrated history of providing results via creative PR programs. Jennefer is the author of “The Little Book of Big PR: 100+ Quick Tips to Get Your Small Business Noticed” (HarperCollins).<br /><br />A highly successful entrepreneur, she is a polished, dynamic speaker with a warm, approachable style. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
