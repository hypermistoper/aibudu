{% raw %}In Episode 2 of the Fashion East documentary, we follow the journey of Lulu Kennedy’s newest recruits for their first shows with the designer mentorship scheme, and learn what exactly it takes to become part of Fashion East.<br /> <br />First up is recent MA graduate and menswear designer Stefan Cooke, who digitally manipulates timeless fabrics and classic charity shop gems, reproducing the print onto flexible synthetic materials, dressing an army of princes for battle on the runway. To find out what it takes to become a designer, we join Lulu at an inspirational talk to fashion students at Central Saint Martins, meeting the up and coming names who have a Fashion East sponsorship in their sights. Finally we’re introduced to Charlotte Knowles, a womenswear designer that specialises in the tension between revealing and concealing, and the Fashion East team call her into the office for a chat about opportunities in the near future…<br /> <br />How do you make the leap from fashion graduate to fully fledged designer? What do the Fashion East team look for in a newcomer? And after having just joined the scheme, will Stefan be ready to show at MAN?  <br /><br /><br />Director Tom Ivin<br />Producer Declan Higgins<br />Shooting Assistant Producer Kez Coo<br /><br />Global Executive Producer Eloise King<br /><br />Editor Isolde Penwarden<br />Additional Editor Paul Frankl<br /><br />Colourist Benjamin Rozario<br />Dubbing Mixer Matt Cheney, Ben Sims<br /><br />Production Manager Lauran Clark<br />Production Coordinator Rosa Harris Edmonds<br /><br />Post Production Manager Tom Lynch<br />Post Production Coordinator Regina Lemaire-Costa<br /> <br />Director of Licensing Cristina Lombardo<br />Senior Music Supervisor, EMEA Alex Benge<br />Music Supervisor Bonnie Reilly<br /> <br />Senior Designer Rebecca Boyd-Wallis<br />Designer Kristina Britton<br /> <br />Production Accountant David Gray<br /> <br />Equipment Manager Henry Cotsford<br />Equipment Assistant Jamie Gettings<br /> <br />Post Tech Supervisor Dominic Brouard<br /> <br />Senior VP Production, UK Bree Horn<br />Head of Post Production Daniel Elias <br />Channel Manager, UK Jordan Joseph<br /><br />Stefan Cooke Fashion Film - Stefan Cooke and Jake Burt <br />Cast Arun and Benjamin at SUPA.
