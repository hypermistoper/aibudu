{% raw %}About this clip: Miranda - for a change - cares for Carrie's opinion on her moving to LA with Che. The eavesdropping rabbi tries to educate the arguing 50 year olds. Later, since Rock acts up and makes Charlotte feel like a loser mom (once again), the latter takes matter in her own hands and becomes &quot;the chosen one&quot; for the mitzvah presided over by the trans-rabbi.{% endraw %}
