{% raw %}Students use two different methods to determine the densities of a variety of materials and objects. The first method involves direct measurement of the volumes of objects that have simple geometric shapes. The second is the water displacement method, used to determine the volumes of irregularly shaped objects. After the densities are determined, students create x-y scatter graphs of mass versus volume, which reveal that objects with densities less than water (floaters) lie above the graph's diagonal (representing the density of water), and those with densities greater than water (sinkers) lie below the diagonal.<br /><br />View the full activity at TeachEngineering: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.teachengineering.org/acti...">https://www.teachengineering.org/acti...</a><br /><br />TeachEngineering has over 1,500 FREE lessons and activities. <br />Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.TeachEngineering.org">http://www.TeachEngineering.org</a> for more!<br /><br />Music: Toe Jam - Diamond Ortiz{% endraw %}
