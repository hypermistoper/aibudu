{% raw %}I describe mechanisms by which deliberate cold exposure can enhance mental health, physical health, and performance. I detail specific protocols to safely engage in deliberate cold exposure, including minimal exposure times, time-of-day effects, determining optimal temperatures, recovery, mindset, and movement during cold exposure. I discuss how cold exposure can be used to safely stress the body to improve attention, mood, and cognitive focus and boost metabolism and reduce inflammation. Also, I explain how cold exposure on specific regions of the body (called glabrous skin surfaces) can be leveraged to enhance endurance and weight training and increase work output.  <br /><br />#HubermanLab #ColdExposure #IceBaths<br /><br />Thank you to our sponsors<br />AG1 (Athletic Greens): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://athleticgreens.com/huberman">https://athleticgreens.com/huberman</a> <br />ROKA: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://roka.com">https://roka.com</a> - use code &quot;huberman&quot;<br />Helix Sleep: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://helixsleep.com/huberman">https://helixsleep.com/huberman</a><br /><br />See Andrew Huberman Live: The Brain Body Contract   <br />Tuesday, May 17th: Seattle, WA<br />Wednesday, May 18th: Portland, OR  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.com/tour">https://hubermanlab.com/tour</a><br /><br />Our Patreon page<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman">https://www.patreon.com/andrewhuberman</a><br /><br />Supplements from Thorne<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thorne.com/u/huberman">https://www.thorne.com/u/huberman</a><br /><br />Social &amp; Website<br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab">https://www.instagram.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hubermanlab">https://twitter.com/hubermanlab</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab">https://www.facebook.com/hubermanlab</a><br />TikTok - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab">https://www.tiktok.com/@hubermanlab</a><br />Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.com">https://hubermanlab.com</a><br />Newsletter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network">https://hubermanlab.com/neural-network</a><br /><br />Subscribe to the Huberman Lab Podcast:<br />Apple Podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/3DbFdlv">https://apple.co/3DbFdlv</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/34Xod5H">https://spoti.fi/34Xod5H</a><br />Google Podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3wo01EJ">https://bit.ly/3wo01EJ</a><br />Other platforms: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hubermanlab.com/follow">https://hubermanlab.com/follow</a><br /><br />Article Links<br />Brief aerobic exercise immediately enhances visual attentional control and perceptual speed.
