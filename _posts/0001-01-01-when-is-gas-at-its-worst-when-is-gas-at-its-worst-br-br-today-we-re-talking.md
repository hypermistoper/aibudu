{% raw %}When is GAS at its Worst?<br /><br />Today we're talking about GAS, specifically, when it's at its worst. Gear Acquisition Syndrome (GAS) is frequently sited as a source of procrastination when working on electronic music. Excuses are also another HUGE productivity killer. So when GAS is actually used as an excuse to not work on electronic music, it's especially deadly. The mindset of &quot;I can't make this type of music because I need the feature from X piece of gear first,&quot; not only keeps you from making any music, it actually stifles your creativity. Chances are, you already own a piece of gear that can achieve the end result you want, you just need to approach it with a little creative problem solving, which is a skill that constantly needs to be used in the world of electronic music!
