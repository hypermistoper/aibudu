{% raw %}With Nazi Germany pushing its way through France, Winston Churchill (Gary Oldman) is poised to give the most momentous speech of his life: &quot;We shall go on to the end. We shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be. We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender!&quot; Watch the full scene from Joe Wright's Darkest Hour now.<br /><br />Academy Award® winner Gary Oldman gives a &quot;towering performance&quot; (Richard Lawson, Vanity Fair) in acclaimed director Joe Wright's soaring drama Darkest Hour. As Hitler's forces storm across the European landscape and close in on the United Kingdom, Winston Churchill (Oldman) is elected the new Prime Minister. With his party questioning his every move, and King George VI (Ben Mendelsohn) skeptical of his new political leader, it is up to Churchill to lead his nation and protect them from the most dangerous threat ever seen. Also starring Academy Award® nominee Kristin Scott Thomas and Lily James, Darkest Hour is a powerful, inspirational drama.<br /><br />Subscribe to Focus Features: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/FocusFeaturesYouTube">http://bit.ly/FocusFeaturesYouTube</a><br /><br />Become a Focus Insider: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://insider.focusfeatures.com">https://insider.focusfeatures.com</a> <br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.focusfeatures.com">https://www.focusfeatures.com</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/focusfeatures">https://www.instagram.com/focusfeatures</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/focusfeatures">https://www.facebook.com/focusfeatures</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/focusfeatures">https://twitter.com/focusfeatures</a>{% endraw %}
