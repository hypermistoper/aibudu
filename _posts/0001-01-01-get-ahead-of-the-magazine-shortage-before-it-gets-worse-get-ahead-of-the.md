{% raw %}Get Ahead Of The Magazine Shortage Before It Gets Worse<br />If you are a prepper, it's probably a good idea to stock up on magazines as there appears to be a shortage going on right now.<br /><br />I recently purchased a new firearm and went about my usual activity of finding additional magazines for it. During that process, I was made aware of the fact that there is a shortage of certain magazines going on right now. I am very prepared in the department of SHTF guns and ammo but you need magazines for the two to work together. And they are not something you can easily acquire after a big SHTF event. So get ahead of this magazine shortage now by getting what you need. I was told that production should get back on track by the fall. Do you think that will actually happen?<br /><br />For more information on SHTF prepping, please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.MagicPrepper.com">https://www.MagicPrepper.com</a><br /><br />Invader Coffee is what I'll be drinking in the apocalypse.
