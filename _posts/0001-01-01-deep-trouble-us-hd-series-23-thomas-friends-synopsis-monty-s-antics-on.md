{% raw %}Synopsis: Monty's antics on a construction site get him into trouble. #Thomas #DeepTrouble #Series23US<br /><br />Mattel green-lit a new series and several specials for Thomas &amp; Friends that premiered in 2019. Production began on the twenty-third series which consisted of 20 11-minute episodes as well as two stories split between three 22-minute specials (one stand-alone and the other a two-parter) following the recent revamp of the series.<br /><br />The series is once again split into two halves: one half with Thomas travelling around the world and one half taking place on the Island of Sodor. Along with more episodes set in the previously visited China, India, and Australia, Thomas also visited two more countries, Italy and Brazil.<br /><br />The remaining original members of the Steam Team (Thomas, Percy, James, Gordon, and Emily), as well as Bertie and Bulgy, received updated character models this series in order to maintain visual consistency with the newer, more detailed engines. They feature new minor cosmetic details such as additional rivets, handrails, and stepladders.<br /><br />At the end of 2019, Mattel ended the new deal with Nickelodeon for the show's airing rights in America. The series was then streamed on Netflix the following year.<br /><br />Thomas &amp; Friends owned by Hit/Mattel Creations.  No money is intended to be made off this video. I own nothing.
