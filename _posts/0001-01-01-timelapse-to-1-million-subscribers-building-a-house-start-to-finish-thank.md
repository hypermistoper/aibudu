{% raw %}May 10, 2022 we not only hit our 4 year anniversary of moving to this property but we also hit 1 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS on our YouTube Channel! <br />4 years ago we sold everything we owned except our tools and our rv, moved out to 73 acres of raw land in West Virginia and embarked on the journey of a lifetime.  As husband and wife, we built our home from the ground up over the past 4 years.  <br />We started out documenting our journey with the intention to share with our family and for our kids to be able to look back on when they were older.  Little did we know, you all would welcome us into your homes week after week.  You've laughed with us, cried with us, encouraged us, and cheered us on as we poured our blood, sweat and tears into building a home for our family.  <br />Thank you so much for being a part of our story and for making such a huge difference in our lives!<br />This is our timelapse showing the last 4 years of our build, our family and the road to 1 million subscribers!<br /><br />Shop Our Apparel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bunkerbranding.com/pages/wild-wonderful-off-grid">https://www.bunkerbranding.com/pages/wild-wonderful-off-grid</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9md3fIfMWiQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9md3fIfMWiQ</a><br /><br />We are a couple who are building our own home from the ground up in the mountains of West Virginia.  After living near the city our entire lives we finally decided to sell it all, pack up our 3 kids and live in an RV on our 73 acres while building our own debt free, off-grid house and learning to live a more self-reliant life.<br />Our house build is documented entirely on our main channel &quot;Wild Wonderful Off-Grid&quot; and our family life vlogs can be found on our secondary channel &quot;Wild Wonderful After Show&quot;{% endraw %}
