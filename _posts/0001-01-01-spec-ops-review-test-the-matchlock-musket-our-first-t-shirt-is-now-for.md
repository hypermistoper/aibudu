Visit bit.ly/ShiftFireMerch to grab yours!<br /><br />Cam and Israel are back with another episode of Lethal Antiquities: this time, our Spec Ops test and review the famous Matchlock Musket. Equipped with its own monopod, the matchlock musket is one of the first concentrated aim and fire handheld weapons following the cannon. With crossbow triggers and 72 caliber rifle bullets, this piece of antique weaponry was a deadly weapon back in the old days. And, as you could see the boys were very excited to shoot it! <br /><br />0:00 - Introduction<br />0:17 - Presentation<br />1:20 - Talking with our guest Clay Van Sickle<br />2:20 - What is the mystery weapon?<br />11:19 - Shooting with the with the matchlock musket<br />16:19 - First impressions<br />19:04 - Conclusion<br />20:07 - Outro<br /><br />Great reloading animation of the musket by &quot;noob&quot;<br />âž¡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/jrzJrOIDb-w">https://youtu.be/jrzJrOIDb-w</a><br /><br />#musket #specops #military<br />--------------------<br />Israel Wright: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/myhappyself2/">https://www.instagram.com/myhappyself2/</a><br />His twitch channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/myhappyself">https://www.twitch.tv/myhappyself</a><br />Cameron Fath : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/cameroncfath">https://www.instagram.com/cameroncfath</a>{% endraw %}
