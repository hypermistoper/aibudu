{% raw %}Radar &amp; Trains!  Railroad Construction Update!  New Track Being Built &amp; Railroad Shoo-Fly Has 2 Trains Booking Around It With Speed Checked By Radar!  Watch these trains fly around the temporary track and see the new industrial spur construction.  Trackwork is being done and a new switch for the permanent siding has been installed.    The 2nd train really looks awesome at the railroad crossing and watching it curve around the construction zone.    We see 2 Norfolk Southern freight trains running between Cincinnati and Chattanooga, Tennessee.  This is the NS Rat Hole Line.  Filmed on the day of the Kentucky Derby on May 7, 2022.  I got home just in time to watch one of the most exciting horse races in history that took place in Louisville, Kentucky.  A horse with 80 to 1 odds won the race and was the second biggest upset in history.    Todays art at the end of the video was done by Lillia.  It is a cats eye that she did in art class.  I think its Norfies left eye.<br />     Thanks for watching!  If you have time, please watch another video of mine to help keep my channel going.   Every view helps support my channel.  Viewing time helps pay for gas, motels, rental cars etc.  I have a list of places that I plan on filming so watch another video of mine if you have the time.  <br /><br />Longest Military Train Ever!  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_6QGzce8F8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_6QGzce8F8</a><br /><br />Military Train With Army Tanks Street Running!  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQy49yJyvc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tQy49yJyvc</a><br /><br />Fast Train Hits RR Crossing Gate With Force!  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANyCdvB5m_I">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANyCdvB5m_I</a><br /><br />Weirdest Exempt Railroad Crossing Ever!  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1DZWhE7pJ0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J1DZWhE7pJ0</a><br /><br />Awesome video of Loaded Coal Train going over old Trestle In Snow!
