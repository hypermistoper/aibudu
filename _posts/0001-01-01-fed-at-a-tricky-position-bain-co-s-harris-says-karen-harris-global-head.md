{% raw %}Karen Harris, global head of macro research at Bain &amp; Co., discusses the outlook for the U.S. economy and its implications for Federal Reserve policy. The U.S. labor market showed unexpected strength last month despite record Covid-19 infections, extending momentum into the new year as surging wages added more pressure on the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Harris also talks about China's economy and the central bank policy. She speaks with Haidi Stroud-Watts and Shery Ahn on &quot;Bloomberg Daybreak: Asia.&quot;{% endraw %}
