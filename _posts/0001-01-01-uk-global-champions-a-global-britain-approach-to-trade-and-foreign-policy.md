{% raw %}The IEA is delighted to host an upcoming Panel Discussion on the topic on “UK Global Champions – A Global Britain approach to Trade and Foreign Policy”, which will be taking place on Monday 9th May from 18:00-19:00 BST at the IEA Westminster office.<br /><br /> Britain’s exit from the European Union provides a unique opportunity to redefine her role in the world. Yet despite the positive narrative surrounding ‘Global Britain’ there is a lack of detail about what this means.<br /><br /> Most trade agreements are simply rollovers of previous agreements while the UK continues to trade less compared to many leading economies. Nearly half of British firms are facing issues trading with the EU under the new arrangements, according to the British Chambers of Commerce. Can Britain take advantage of the opportunities and flexibility of an independent trade policy and compensate for lost trade with the EU? Thousands of British businesses have exceptional global brand value and opportunity for expansion. Trade facilitates more better paying jobs, greater specialisation, and more consumer choice<br /><br /> Earlier this year, the IEA submitted written evidence to the International Trade Committee’s inquiry exploring the interplay between the UK’s approach to trade and its foreign policy objectives. Authored by Matthew Lesh (IEA Head of Public Policy) and Victoria Hewson (IEA Head of Regulatory Affairs), calling for a Global Britain approach to trade and foreign policy that supports Britain’s Global champions. <br /><br /> What does a Global Britain approach to foreign policy and trade mean in practice? What would boosting UK Global Champions and British exports and imports mean for the economy? Should the UK use trade as a foreign policy tool as an enabler of a more liberal and democratic world? This panel discussion seeks to address these questions, and more. <br /><br />Confirmed to speak on this panel currently are:<br /><br />Greg Smith MP (Conservative MP for Buckingham and Co-Chair of Free Market Forum), Victoria Hewson (IEA Head of Regulatory Affairs), Andy Burwell (International Director, CBI), Matthew Lesh (IEA Head of Public Policy) and Annabel Denham, who will chair the event (IEA Director of Communications).{% endraw %}
