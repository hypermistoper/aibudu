She pushes large mounds of stone that contains a Bust Head Zombie in a similar manner to Troglobite and Arcade Zombie. She is also able to instantly petrify hypnotized zombies as well as Zoybean Pod's zomboids and Pumpkin Witch's pumpkin zombies and replace them with a stone slab that absorbs plant attacks. <br /><br />Healer Zombie is a zombie encountered exclusively in Penny's Pursuit and Arena. With his caduceus, he can heal zombies and undo negative effects done to them.<br /><br />In the Chinese version, he has an Elite variant that can give zombies an invincibility boost for a few seconds.{% endraw %}
