{% raw %}Watch this video to find out how to choose a computer for architecture or interior design 2021. I'll be walking you through the best types of computers for architects, computers for interior designers, computers for architecture students, computers for interior design students and lastly computers for interior architecture students!<br /><br />That whole saga of picking the best laptop for architecture / best laptop for interior design, can last soooo long right?! Which is why I've condensed it down into this video for you guys. Maybe you‚Äôre an architect or interior designer looking to level up the current computer you have. Or maybe you‚Äôre a student who is about to start your design studies, in which case you‚Äôre probably looking at buying your first laptop or computer specifically for design. I know when I saw a student going into design school, I thought the laptop I had was good enough ‚Äì and bless it, I worked that thing to the core! But looking back that one was not a suitable computer for rendering and processing programs like revit, autocad, vectorworks or rhino. No bloody way lol :D And because of that, in this video I‚Äôll be talking about things I wish I had known back then, and also giving you a checklist (if you like) of design computer specifications to look out for on your search for the top architecture computer / top interior design computer for you. So, if you want to know which computer you should buy for architecture or interior design, lets go!<br /><br />‚è∞TIME STAMPS:<br />0:00 Intro<br />1:22 My lenovo thinkpad P51<br />2:47 Transportability<br />3:46 Computer vs Tablet<br />4:35 4 crucial things to look out for<br />5:24 RAM random access memory<br />6:23 GPU graphics card<br />7:46 SSD/HDD storage space<br />8:58 Apple vs Microsoft<br />10:52 Aesthetics<br />11:45 Gaming laptops for architects and interior designers<br />12:24 Computer brands for architecture and interior design<br /><br />If you're new here, Welcome! üëã On this channel we share tutorials &amp; insights into interior design, architecture, illustration, graphic design, content creation and all the creative stuff in betweenüñåÔ∏èüìê.
