{% raw %}Most of us think children are too young for certain conversations. But what would happen if that changed? In this sincere and thought-provoking TEDx Talk, Chris Tompkins unravels a complex issue unlike we've ever heard.<br /><br />Chris Tompkins teaches intrapersonal development, self-empowerment, and confidence building at high schools, after school programs, Big Brothers Big Sisters, and LGBT Centers throughout Southern California and at LA Central Juvenile Hall. Chris is a published writer and has contributed to the Huffington Post, the Elephant Journal, and the Good Men Project. He believes connecting with our spirituality, loving ourselves, and taking full responsibility of our lives is where our strength lies at the deepest level of the LGBT movement. Helping youth access this information at an early age can change the trajectory of their lives and get us closer to a more peaceful planet. His ultimate mission is to help heal homophobia before it begins and help to prevent bullying before it starts. Chris Tompkins is a teacher, speaker, spiritual counselor, and LGBT “inner advocate” based in Los Angeles, CA.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
