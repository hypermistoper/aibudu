{% raw %}On September 17, 2019, the repo market crashed overnight, and almost two years ago in February 2020, the world became aware of the spread of COVID-19. Today’s guest says that he knew that from the beginning that something wasn’t adding up and that’s when he began his quest to find answers. <br /><br />Chris Martenson is an economic researcher and futurist specializing in energy and resource depletion, and co-founder of PeakProsperity.com says, “The repo market was blowing up and COVID was the best thing that could have happened to a Federal Reserve that needed a reason to print trillions.”<br /><br />Host Robert Kiyosaki and guest Chris Martenson discuss Chris’ research into the COVID-19 pandemic, and how answers can be found if we “follow the money.”<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.richdad.com/">https://www.richdad.com/</a><br /><br />Facebook: @RobertKiyosaki<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RobertKiyosaki/">https://www.facebook.com/RobertKiyosaki/</a><br /><br />Twitter: @TheRealKiyosaki<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki">https://twitter.com/theRealKiyosaki</a><br /><br />Instagram: @TheRealKiyosaki<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/therealkiyosaki/">https://www.instagram.com/therealkiyosaki/</a>{% endraw %}
