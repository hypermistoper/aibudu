Champagne, Hennessy<br />A favorite of my homies when we floss on our enemies<br />Witness as we creep to a low speed, peep what my foes need<br />Puff some mo' weed, funk, ya don't need<br />Approachin' hoochies with a passion, been a long day<br />But I've been driven by attraction in a strong way<br />Your body is bangin', baby, I love it when you flaunt it<br />Time to give it to daddy, sugar, now tell me how you want it<br /><br />Little do you know<br />I know you’re hurt while I'm sound asleep<br />Little do you know<br />All my mistakes are solely drowning me<br />Little do you know<br />I’m trying to make it better piece by piece<br />Little do you know<br />I, I love you till the sun dies<br /><br />Tell me, baby, is it cool to touch?<br />I'm a man that you can trust, not just a fool in lust<br />Comin' to get you on the bus is so ironic<br />Exotic, on the verge of erotic<br />I'm hittin' switches on misses<br />Like I been fixed with hydraulics<br />My up and down like a roller coaster<br />Can I cum inside you?<br />I ain't stoppin' 'til the show is over<br />'Cause I'm a rider<br />In and out just like a robbery<br />I'll probably be a freak and let you get on top of me<br />Get her rockin' these, nights full of Alize<br />A livin' legend you ain't heard about<br />The players living Cali days<br />Delores Tucker, you a fake to me<br />Instead of tryin' to help a brother, wanna take his G's<br />Mistaking me for Bill Clinton, Mister Bob Dole<br />You're too old to understand the way the game's told<br />You're lame so I gotta hit you with the hot tracks<br />Once I'm released, I'm makin' millions, try and top that<br />They wanna censor me; they'd rather see me in my cell<br />Livin' in hell, only a few of us'll live to tell<br />Now everybody talkin' about us, I ain't giving up<br />Very wonder taught us all to cuss<br />Come on, tell me how you want it<br /><br />Little do you know<br />I know you’re hurt while I'm sound asleep<br />Little do you know<br />All my mistakes are solely drowning me<br />Little do you know<br />I’m trying to make it better piece by piece<br />Little do you know<br />I, I love you till the sun dies<br /><br />I was raised as a youth, tell the truth<br />I got the scoop on how to get a bulletproof<br />Lickin' shots off from the roof<br />Before I was a teenager, mobile phone, Skypager<br />Game rules, I'm livin' major<br />My adversaries is lookin' worried<br />They paranoid of gettin' buried<br />One of us gon' see the cemetery<br />They wonder if my lifestyle's changed<br />And am I through with all the pain<br />Survivin' in this game<br />And still the same<br />Honey, just meet me at the strip club, bring a thong<br />Look how they shakin' for that cash<br />Once again, it's on<br />I have no sympathy for those who afraid of mystery<br />Come get with me, I promise passion and ecstacy<br />I'm alone, can I come over<br />There tonight?<br />Depend on me, the one to handle it and get it right<br />Your body is bangin', baby, I love the way you flaunt it<br />Time to give it to daddy, sugar, now tell me how you want it<br /><br />Little do you know<br />I know you’re hurt while I'm sound asleep<br />Little do you know<br />All my mistakes are solely drowning me<br />Little do you know<br />I’m trying to make it better piece by piece<br />Little do you know<br />I, I love you till the sun dies<br /><br />Little do you know<br />I know you’re hurt while I'm sound asleep<br />Little do you know<br />All my mistakes are solely drowning me<br />Little do you know<br />I’m trying to make it better piece by piece<br />Little do you know<br />I, I love you till the sun dies<br /><br />Little do you know<br />I, I love you till the sun dies<br /><br />For any business enquiries, photo and song submissions or anything else please do not hesitate to contact us - Info@MrRevillz.com<br /><br /><br /> remix sad song 2pac sad songs tupac 2pac little do you know{% endraw %}
