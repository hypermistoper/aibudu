{% raw %}This is an alternative method to the double depth neckband that I usually knit, and which is finished on waste yarn, turned to the outside and back stitched in place.<br /><br />On this method, the neckband is knitted separately, then the body of the garment picked up around the neckline, joined and cast off.  It is the method I would choose for a roll neck, or polo neck and is also a better choice for thicker, chunky yarns where the double thickness band is too bulky.<br /><br />I have knitted this sample on my Silver Reed SK280 and SRP60N ribber, but it can be knitted on any brand, or gauge, of flatbed knitting machine with a ribbing attachment.{% endraw %}
