{% raw %}I'm back with another Alfie video, I hope you like it please let me know what you think about it down below!<br />[Youtube blocked it in UK and Ireland I'm sorry, that's one of the many struggles of editing this series I swear it's always blocked somewhere, I can't fix it blame YouTube, your only way to watch it is to use a vpn]<br /> <br />Anyways, I wanted to wish you a happy new year, hopefully 2021 will be better. Also, for those who celebrates it, I hope you had a lovely christmas!<br />Let's end this year with a 6 minutes long video of Alfie Solomons, sorry Tommy but he's my favorite :)<br /><br />Ps: thank you for all the support you've shown me this year, I appreciate every single one of you! I'll stop annoying y'all now! ENJOY and stay safe.<br /><br />#peakyblinders #alfiesolomons #fanvidfeed{% endraw %}
