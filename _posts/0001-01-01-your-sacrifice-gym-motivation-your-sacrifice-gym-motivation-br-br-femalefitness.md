{% raw %}YOUR SACRIFICE ðŸ¥º Gym Motivation<br /><br />#femalefitness #motivation #alphamotivation <br /><br />Speech in the video: Don't stop. Narrow your focus to one idea. One. And make it work. Make it your priority and stick with it no matter what. You guys need to understand what you don't have to do.<br /><br />So the greatest things in life take sacrifice and discipline. And that's why so few people achieve great things. Because they don't wanna sacrifice, they don't wanna discipline for something greater. So you see all these people who have great things in life that you look up to, it's because they sacrificed and disciplined long before you ever knew them.<br />No one can make you do or not do what you said you're gonna do. Tell yourself every morning, I'm gonna stick to this, I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna strive for this goal. <br /><br />If you have micro focus, if you can get a chance to pay attention to detail, that's how you break out of the pack. That's how you go from being average to above average performer. With focus you are unstoppable.<br /><br />IMPORTANT: If you have anything against my uploads contact me here: legionofathletesmotivation@gmail.com <br /><br />Subscribe so that you don't miss other upcoming videos.<br /><br />Song: Axol &amp; The Tech Thieves - Bleed [NCS Release] <br />Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.<br />Watch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/xYfn7MWU7TQ">https://youtu.be/xYfn7MWU7TQ</a><br />Download/Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ncs.io/BleedCr">http://ncs.io/BleedCr</a><br /><br />Anikdote - Turn It Up [NCS Release]<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/S6RWY8OYwbk">https://youtu.be/S6RWY8OYwbk</a> <br /><br />Thumbnail: Gabby Fortune<br /><br />Alpha Motivation will bring you the best motivational videos in the fitness Industry.
