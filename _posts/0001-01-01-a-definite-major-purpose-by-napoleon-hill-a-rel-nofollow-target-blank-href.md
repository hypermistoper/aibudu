Keep this constantly in mind. Weak desire brings weak results, just as a small fire makes a small amount of heat.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Whatever the mind can conceive and believe, it can achieve.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;You are the master of your destiny. You can influence, direct and control your own environment. You can make your life what you want it to be.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;If you can't do great things, do small things in a great way.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;You may be hurt if you love too much, but you will live in misery if you love too little.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;When your desires are strong enough, you will appear to possess superhuman powers to achieve them.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Do not wait: the time will never be 'just right'. Start where you stand, and work whatever tools you may have at your command and better tools will be found as you go along.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Every adversity, every failure, every heartache carries with it the seed of an equal or greater benefit.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Our only limitations are those we set up in our own minds&quot;{% endraw %}
