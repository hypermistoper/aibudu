{% raw %}In this episode, I am heading further in the state of Chiapas, in Mexico. I am looking to meet some of the Mexican native people, the Lacandones. They live in a mystical area of the jungle, with scattered lakes and cenotes and abundant wildlife. <br /><br />Many thanks to my friend Jesus from Sport Cycle Tours Mexico, who helped me with this route and to find the Lacandones people. They actually organise motorcycle tours in Mexico, so if you are interested, check out their instagram @instachuchogram or write them at chucho@sportcyclecentre.com ! <br /><br />Want to learn how to use drones, GoPros and 360 cameras to film your solo motorcycle adventure? Check out: www.itchyboots.com/academy <br /><br />Here I teach all my filming techniques including getting drone shots while riding!<br /><br />Gear &amp; Equipment that I use in this season: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.itchyboots.com/blog/gear-and-equipment-season-6-alaska">https://www.itchyboots.com/blog/gear-and-equipment-season-6-alaska</a><br /><br />Follow my journey on: WWW.ITCHYBOOTS.COM<br />Instagram:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/itchybootstravel">https://www.instagram.com/itchybootstravel</a><br />Facebook:     <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/itchyboots">https://www.facebook.com/itchyboots</a><br /><br /><br />#itchyboots #adventure #crf300rally{% endraw %}
