{% raw %}9 CoComelon Hurry to the Toilet Sound Variations in 30 seconds<br />The idea is taken from this channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-4_UbH3inlBglw3Li2OZ4g/videos">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-4_UbH3inlBglw3Li2OZ4g/videos</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Hello everyone To make such an animation, I search for a lot of pictures on the Internet that do not have copyrights, connect them with sound. I mount everything in Sony Vegas 16 for about an hour, then I cut out png images from the video and make a preview of them in Photoshop for about 20 minutes, I think it deserves your like guys! I love you! Enjoy watching, comment and put likes so that more people see the video!<br />Copyright by SM (Sound Meme)<br />All rights reserved<br />#soundvariations​​​ #soundvariationsmeme​​​​ #meme{% endraw %}
