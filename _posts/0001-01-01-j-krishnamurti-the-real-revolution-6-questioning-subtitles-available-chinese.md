Questioning<br /><br />Krishnamurti with students at the Thacher School<br /><br />One should have a bit of skepticism when asking questions. A wrong question will have no answer, but a right question, in its very asking, unfolds the understanding of it. It needs intelligence and sensitivity to ask the right question and to see all that is involved in it and go to the very end of it. <br /><br />The real revolution Series<br /><br />These eight programmes were produced and broadcast in America by the National Educational Television Network. They represent the earliest sound films of Krishnamurti speaking to audiences – it was the first time that he had allowed his talks and discussion groups to be filmed. The principle settings are the Oak Grove in Ojai, California, and the Thacher School in the Ojai Valley.<br />---<br /><br />This channel is managed by the Krishnamurti Foundation Trust​​, UK​, and by the Krishnamurti Foundation of America.<br /><br />The role of the foundations was described by Krishnamurti when he said,​ ​'The foundations will see to it that these teachings are kept whole, are not distorted, are not made corrupt. They will not give rise to any sectarian spirit in their activities... nor create any kind of place of worship around the teachings or the person.​'​<br /><br />We maintain extensive archives of Krishnamurti's original works and all four Krishnamurti foundations are actively engaged in the publication of material in various forms.<br /><br />Our videos contain thousands of subtitles in more than 25 languages, translated by volunteers from all over the world. If you would like to help us with translating subtitles, please contact us at digital@kfoundation.org<br /><br />For more information about J.
