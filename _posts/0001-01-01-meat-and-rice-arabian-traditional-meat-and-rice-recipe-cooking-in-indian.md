{% raw %}Today in our village, we cook delicious traditional Arabian recipe by cooking Meat and Rice Together. We use big-size mutton meat and Basmati rice to make this recipe.<br /><br />This is a very simple recipe but it's a time taken recipe because mutton meat needs to cook well than normal.<br /><br />Finally, we enjoy this Arabian recipe with our south Indian traditional mutton curry recipe.{% endraw %}
