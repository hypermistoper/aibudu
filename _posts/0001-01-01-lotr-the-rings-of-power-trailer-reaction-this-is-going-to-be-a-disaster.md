{% raw %}The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power trailer dropped yesterday during the Super Bowl and if you blinked you missed it. If you just watch the trailer without reading the associated Vanity Fair article. The only thing you will know is it's diverse. At best a generic Fantasy trailer, at worst and sure sign this is going to be the woke, intersectional disaster so many of us think it will be. Oh, and where is the Silvan Elf Barber shop?<br />#LOTRonPrime #RingsOfPower #LOTR<br /><br />Edited by @Pierry Chan <br /><br />Special thanks to AZ from @HeelvsBabyface <br /><br />Trailer Reaction Live Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJOIkp3mk80">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJOIkp3mk80</a><br /><br />Become a Nerdrotic Channel Member: youtube.com/c/sutrowatchtower/join<br /><br />Subscribe to The Nerdrotic Network: @Nerdrotic @Nerdrotic Live @Nerdrotic Daily  <br /><br />Nerdrotic Blend Coffee from Geek Grind:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geekgrindcoffee.com/products/nerdrotic-all-hail-blend-private-blend">https://geekgrindcoffee.com/products/nerdrotic-all-hail-blend-private-blend</a><br /><br />Nerdrotic Coffee Cup from Geek Grind:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geekgrindcoffee.com/products/bm15oz-15-oz-black-mug-2?_pos=2&amp;_sid=b6f535164&amp;_ss=r">https://geekgrindcoffee.com/products/bm15oz-15-oz-black-mug-2?_pos=2&amp;_sid=b6f535164&amp;_ss=r</a>{% endraw %}
