{% raw %}UPDATE, 9 March, 2022: Best way to avoid contamination: use coco coir substrate instead of grains. I show you how, in my latest video, here: “How to Prepare Coco Coir (CVG) for Mushroom Growing Using an InstantPot &amp; Unmodified Tub Grow”<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/r7fN2SeXlHs">https://youtu.be/r7fN2SeXlHs</a><br /><br />Original Description: <br />A quick video about how to tell if your mushroom grow is contaminated, possible mistakes made along the way, what to do with the trash you’ve cultivated. <br /><br />I overcooked the rye berries, and attempted to use liquid culture made from adding water to a quart of colonized consolidated grain, shaking hard, and dumping it in the tub. This likely introduced the contamination, and made the whole tub too wet. <br /><br />Many experienced growers will claim this type of operation can’t be done contamination free without a vent hood, but I have one tub that proves it absolutely can. Even with overcooked, excessively wet substrate. <br /><br />#mushroomgrowing #dubtub #monotub #contamination #mycelium #mushroomcontamination{% endraw %}
