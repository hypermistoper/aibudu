{% raw %}Exploring abandoned places is my hobby and finance it all out of my own pocket and the donations I get from the people who love watching the documentaries we make... A small donation would be greatly appreciated! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/brosofdecay">https://www.patreon.com/brosofdecay</a><br /><br />Siblings-the definition that comprises love, strife, competition, and forever friends.<br /><br />Today we tell the story of Carlo and Maria, brother and sister, who grew up in a remote village in the Alpine Mountains of Italy. They were best friends from the day they were born and decided to spend their whole life together. When their parents passed away they split the family home into 2, Carlo lived on the right side and Maria on the left. They both got married, had children, and lived happy and long lives in their remote Alpine mountain houses. From the day they were born they made countless memories inside these walls. But unfortunately, great things don’t last forever, after both their children moved out in search of better opportunities, Carlo and Maria lived out their last years. Both of them rose to heaven around a decade ago and their forever loving houses are left to crumble and decay. <br /><br />Today we will give you a glimpse of their former lives and take you on a tour through their magical kingdom. <br /><br />SOCIALS:<br />Instagram ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brosofdecay/">https://www.instagram.com/brosofdecay/</a><br />Facebook ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Brothersofdecay/">https://www.facebook.com/Brothersofdecay/</a><br />Twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/brosofdecay">https://twitter.com/brosofdecay</a><br /><br />Abandoned House Abandoned Mansion Urbex Exploring{% endraw %}
