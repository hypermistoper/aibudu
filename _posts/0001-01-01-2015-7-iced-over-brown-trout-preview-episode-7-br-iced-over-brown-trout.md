{% raw %}Episode 7<br />Iced Over Brown Trout<br />Show Date: February 14th &amp; 15th, 2015<br />Location: Lake Michigan, Milwaukee, WI<br />Guide: Charter Captain Brian Settele [414-559-9238 | fishchaserguideservice.com]<br /><br /><br />It’s cold outside, which means we’re usually on frozen water ice fishing.  This week we take a break from ice fishing to open water fish Lake Michigan with Charter Captain Brian Settele and special guest Jordan Gustmas from M-W Marine.  Brian tells us the colder the water is, the better the fishing is on the lake.  The best place to set up is near any place where warm water enters the lake, the baitfish congregate there, so that's where the big fish are.  We are jigging using plastics, spoons, and Kastmasters.  These fish hit hard, and fight harder.{% endraw %}
