For you as an individual, a ticket, plus flights, plus accommodations, plus time, plus foot pain from walking all day… was not even close to worth it. $2,000-$3,000 in exchange for some networking? Can you quantify that? It’s a hefty price any way you slice it. <br /><br />Even for a company. Last month, we flew 6 team members to San Francisco to attend Saastr, and our bill came to around $12,000 all in. We tried to get more value out of the trip than the conference itself, (and we did), but it’s still a lot of money. <br /><br />And that is nothing compared to what companies spend to host a booth and to give away swag.<br /><br />So I sat down with a couple of startups to understand not only why they do it, but how it’s somehow become one of their key outreach tactics. And they’ve... sort of, convinced me. <br /><br />So here’s some of their logic, plus some of my own learnings to make the most out of conferences.  <br /><br /><br /><br />--<br />0:00 Are trade show Booths worth it? - Intro <br />1:55 Are trade show Booths worth it? - What is Saastr?<br />4:05 Are trade show Booths worth it? - The value for sponsors<br />5:55 Are trade show Booths worth it? - The ChartMogul approach<br />8:45 Are trade show Booths worth it?  - The Appsumo approach<br />10:45 Are trade show Booths worth it?  - Tips to make more out of a conference<br />13:55 Are trade show Booths worth it?  - Types of growth<br /><br />--<br />Follow Caya:<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/cayahere">https://twitter.com/cayahere</a><br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/caya_here">https://instagram.com/caya_here</a>{% endraw %}
