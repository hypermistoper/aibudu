{% raw %}You know your Advice Monster! Someone starts to talk … and it looms up out of the shadows wanting to “add value”. In this funny and provocative talk, Bungay Stanier explains how advice-giving goes bad; the three personas of your Advice Monster; and why the powerful act of staying curious a little longer is the secret to taming your Advice Monster. Michael Bungay Stanier’s most recent book is The Advice Trap, a follow-up to 2016's Coaching Habit which has become the best-selling on coaching of the century with more than ¾ million copies sold. He is the Founder of Box of Crayons, a learning and development company that helps organizations transform from advice-driven to curiosity-led. He is Australian, was a Rhodes Scholar, and lives in Toronto. He can be found at MBS.works. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
