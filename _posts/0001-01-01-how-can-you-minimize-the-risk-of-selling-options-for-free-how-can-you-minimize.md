One of the biggest challenges and problems with selling options is that, by selling those options, typically youâ€™re selling someone else insurance or protection. So the question is, if weâ€™re selling someone else protection, how do we protect ourselves from the next big market crash? <br /><br />In this video Iâ€™m going to give you all the ways that I have protected my portfolios over the years of trading in options. As an additional bonus, Iâ€™ll also show you how we are minimizing our risk right now in our portfolio for FREE! This just might give you an idea of how you can protect your portfolio without having to come out of pocket.<br /><br />Happy investing!<br />Randy Perez<br /><br />#highnetworth #tradingcoach #wealth<br /><br />COPYRIGHT: All My Life of Learning's videos, Excel files, guides, and other content are (c) Copyright My Life of Learning.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am not a financial planner and am not offering investment advice.
