{% raw %}Cozy Rain Night at 4K Coffee shop with Relaxing Piano Jazz Music &amp; Soothing Rain Sounds for Sleep<br /><br />Good evening, my friends! ^^<br />I really enjoy the tunes of the jazz piano music and the hot cups of coffee next to it. In the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, we often miss this. So my hobby is creating videos that help you study, improve your mood, relax and sleep easily.<br />It took me 8 hours to be able to create the videos of the cozy book cafe environment (all original artwork, images, sound mix) to ensure the highest quality videos and The most creative I can do. It's my work of love and if you like my work and art, please consider supporting in one of the following ways: üëá<br /><br />| Our tones are released at Spotify, Apple music, Deezer, Amazon Music<br />¬ª Spotify | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5sowIZz4oCttQZR1l24pRn">https://open.spotify.com/artist/5sowIZz4oCttQZR1l24pRn</a><br />¬ª iTunes I <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://music.apple.com/en/artist/tom-media/1596349308">https://music.apple.com/en/artist/tom-media/1596349308</a><br />¬ª Deezer I <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.deezer.com/fr/artist/151867832">https://www.deezer.com/fr/artist/151867832</a><br />¬ª Amazon Music I <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://music.amazon.com/artists/B09M7PVF3R/tom-media">https://music.amazon.com/artists/B09M7PVF3R/tom-media</a><br /><br />The Process of Creating a 3D Image  Made By TomMedia:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXapz7GDdUc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GXapz7GDdUc</a><br /><br />‚òïOn cold rainy nights, what could be better than sitting somewhere in the middle of the noisy city, sipping your favorite drink and watching the space darken in a corner of this cozy room, on a rainy night. The relaxing and smooth melodies of Piano Jazz are enough for those who sit here to feel like they can drop their souls into that wonderful space. A truly meaningful relaxation time before the end of a long day.
