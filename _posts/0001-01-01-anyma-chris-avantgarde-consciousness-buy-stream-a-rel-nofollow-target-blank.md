Anyma has been busy touring as one half of the esteemed techno duo Tale Of Us, where “Consciousness” has become the opening track that sets the vivid scene that Anyma and Tale Of Us are known for. Anyma will continue to tour extensively this year with a residency at Ibiza’s famed super-club Hï, with countless global appearances this summer such as EDC Las Vegas, Tomorrowland, and many more.<br /><br />“Consciousness” releases via Afterlife / EVA DAO on May 18, 2022.<br /><br />Anyma &amp; Chris Avantgarde - Consciousness (AL066){% endraw %}
