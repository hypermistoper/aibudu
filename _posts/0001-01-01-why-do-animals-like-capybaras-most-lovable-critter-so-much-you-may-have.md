{% raw %}You may have wondered why do other animals like the capybaras so much? It seems that every animal like hanging out with this friendly creature that looks like a rat-pig hybrid, even crocodiles! The answer probably lies in the fact that capybaras are very social animals who often live in groups of 10-20 individuals.<br /><br />These lovable creatures are the largest rodents in the world, growing to a size of up to 134cm and weighing up to 66kg. Capybaras are native to South America and are semi-aquatic mammals that prefer to live near bodies of water. In fact, they are excellent swimmers and can avoid predators by staying submerged for up to 5 minutes in water. As if that wasn’t enough, they only mate in water.<br /><br />Capybaras seem to be able to make friends with any other living creature, and people aren’t quite sure why. Regardless of what the real cause of this friendship-making ability is, the capybaras range of friends is really impressive. <br /><br />Can get enought?

He’s just snoozing through this incredible meeting, and the ducks are using his sleeping body as a couch. <br /><br />Here, an adorable capybara is seen lovingly nuzzling someone’s pet cat.<br /><br />Sometimes, capybaras need love, too, so here’s a rabbit passing on some snuggles to one. <br /><br />Here, the monkeys seem to love a capybara! A monkey even jumped and ride on it's back.<br /><br />Cats don’t just get snuggles from capybaras, but play with them, too! <br /><br />Here, a group of turtles  surrounded the capybara in a circle of friendship and love.<br /><br />These lovable dogs are joining in the capybara’s pool party. <br /><br />Rats are seen making friends with cats, and here’s one rat passing a kiss onto a capybara. Maybe rats are more loving than we give them credit for. <br /><br />This cute little  monkey is catching a ride on his capybara buddy! <br /><br />If you are not already impressed by the capybara’s friend-making powers, this picture will surely do you in. This one is seen just chilling out with a crocodile. Unbelievable! <br /><br />This may at least makes a little more sense.

Maybe it just wants to help out. <br /><br />These two look like they’re going on an exploration together. <br /><br />Click link to subscribe to SuperBlueTaurus Channel : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/SuperBlueTaurus?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/user/SuperBlueTaurus?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />To view this channel : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/SuperBlueTaurus">https://www.youtube.com/user/SuperBlueTaurus</a>{% endraw %}
