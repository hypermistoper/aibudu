(Ooh)<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus]<br />When you're out of sight in my mind<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes<br />And that's where I find a glimpse of us<br />And I try to fall for her touch<br />But I'm thinkin' of the way it was<br />Said, &quot;I'm fine&quot; and said, &quot;I moved on&quot;<br />I'm only here passin' time in her arms<br />Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />Tell me he savors your glory<br />Does he laugh the way I did?<br />Is this a part of your story?<br />One that I had never lived<br />Maybe one day you'll feel lonely<br />And in his eyes, you'll get a glimpse<br />Maybe you'll start slippin' slowly and find me again<br /><br />[Pre-Chorus]<br />When you're out of sight in my mind<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes<br />And that's where I find a glimpse of us<br />And I try to fall for her touch<br />But I'm thinkin' of the way it was<br />Said, &quot;I'm fine&quot; and said, &quot;I moved on&quot;<br />I'm only here passin' time in her arms<br />Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us<br /><br />[Bridge]<br />Ooh-ooh-ooh<br />Ooh<br />Ooh-ooh-ooh<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />'Cause sometimes I look in her eyes<br />And that's where I find a glimpse of us<br />And I try to fall for her touch<br />But I'm thinkin' of the way it was<br />Said, &quot;I'm fine&quot; and said, &quot;I moved on&quot;<br />I'm only here passin' time in her arms<br />Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us<br /><br />Tags:<br />Glimpse of Us<br />Glimpse of Us Lyrics<br />Joji Glimpse of Us<br />Glimpse of Us Joji<br />Cause sometimes I look in her eyes<br />And that's where I find a glimpse of us<br />And I try to fall for her touch<br />But I'm thinkin' of the way it was<br />Hopin' I'll find a glimpse of us<br /><br />#Joji #GlimpseOfUs #lyrics <br /><br />Contact: droppinglyricsvibe@gmail.com{% endraw %}
