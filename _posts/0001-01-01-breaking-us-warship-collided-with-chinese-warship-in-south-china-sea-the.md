{% raw %}The Chinese side was prepared for a collision with the US vessel in the contentious waterway, according to a newly released US Navy video of the tense meeting between a Chinese and US warship in the South China Sea.<br />The Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy crew can be seen preparing buoys designed to absorb impact and protect the hull of their ship in the event of a collision between a Chinese Luyang destroyer and the USS Decatur in footage from the incident, which sparked heated exchanges between Washington and Beijing at the time.<br />The video revealed the Chinese crew feared a crash was impending, according to Keith Patton, deputy chairman of the Strategic and Operational Research Department at the US Naval War College.<br />&quot;It might be upping the ante by the PLAN warship signaling its seriousness by making those preparations,&quot; Patton speculated.<br />The preparation of the buoys was a &quot;natural response&quot; ahead of an anticipated accident, according to Hu Bo, director of Peking University's Centre for Maritime Strategy Studies.<br />Following a freedom of information request to the US Department of the Navy last year, the latest video was released to the South China Morning Post this week.<br />The Washington Post initially published video of the tense encounter, coupled with a transcript of correspondence showing how the Chinese side told the US vessel it would face &quot;consequences&quot; if it did not change direction.<br />During a &quot;freedom of navigation&quot; patrol (FONOP) near the disputed Spratly Islands, US officials accused the Chinese vessel of making a &quot;unsafe and unprofessional move&quot; by sailing within 45 yards of the US warship.{% endraw %}
