This narcissistic, little man can’t stand that there are democratic countries close to his borders! So he decided to invade a free, independent neighbor. Let this be a warning to all free, democratic countries: you cannot make deals, trust or co-operate with dictators and murderers!<br />I wanted to compose a piece the same night Russia invaded Ukraine but I was too angry. I can’t create anything while angry. So after calming down and mostly feeling sadness, I made this. I use a part of my composition “Freedom Song” in this one… <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.per-olovkindgren.com/product-tag/freedom-song/">https://shop.per-olovkindgren.com/product-tag/freedom-song/</a><br />As long as Putin is occupying Ukraine, the tabs and sheet music will be for free.<br />Long live Freedom, Love, Peace and Ukraine!<br /><br />Per-Olov{% endraw %}
