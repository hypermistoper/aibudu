{% raw %}E equals mc squared − Even people with no background in physics have at least heard of this equation and are aware of its prodigious influence on the world we live in. This was the equation that gave birth to the atom bomb and heralded a new world of atomic physics.  And since the speed of light is constant, this equation tells us that mass and energy are interconvertible and are two different forms of the same thing and are in fact equivalent. As we know, the speed of light squared (speed of light multiplied by itself) is huge: 9 × 10 to the power of 16 meters square per second square. So if we convert a small amount of mass, we will get a tremendous amount of energy. For example, if we convert 1kg of mass, we will get energy of 9 × 10 to the power of 16 Joules which is equivalent to 21 megatons of TNT. Einstein's equation introduced not only the atomic bomb, but to other ways of harnessing nuclear energy as well. Many physicists and scientists have discussed about mass annihilation at different times. Even a level one literate know that when an electron and a positron approach each other, they annihilate i.e., destroy each other. This process what a quantum physicists call the mass annihilation. During the process their masses are converted into energy in accordance with E = mc squared. Because E = mc squared, virtual particle-antiparticle pairs are continually being created out of energy E of the 4 dimensional fabric of space-time consistent with the uncertainty principle, and then, they appear together at some time, move apart, then come together and annihilate each other giving energy back to the space-time without violating the law of energy conservation. Spontaneous births and deaths of virtual particles so called quantum fluctuations occurring everywhere, all the time − is the conclusion that mass and energy are interconvertible; they are two different forms of the same thing.{% endraw %}
