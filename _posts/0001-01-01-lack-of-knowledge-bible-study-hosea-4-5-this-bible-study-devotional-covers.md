{% raw %}This Bible study devotional covers Hosea 4-5. In this passage, Hosea explains that Israel will be destroyed because of her lack of knowledge. That’s not to say that she doesn’t know enough, but that she has forgotten her marriage covenant with God and, therefore, forgotten God himself. <br /><br />As always, we are committed to showing you how Jesus fulfills these specific passages. In Hosea 4-5, we see that Jesus brings us the knowledge of God we need. Now, when we know Jesus, our marriage covenant is restored, and we can know God.<br />---<br />About Spoken Gospel:<br />Spoken Gospel is a non-profit digital media ministry committed to fostering transformative Bible engagement by producing creative videos that help people see and savor the good news of Jesus on every page of the Bible.
