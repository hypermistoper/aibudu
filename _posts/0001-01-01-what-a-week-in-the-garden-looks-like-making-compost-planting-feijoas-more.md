{% raw %}Starting a garden from scratch means that there is always jobs to do before and after work. To try not let the garden get overwhelming, I do little jobs when and where I can. This sometimes means 5 minutes in the garden adding to a compost bin, feeding the birds or planting one or two plants. In this week's video, I share what a typical week in the life in the garden looks like for me. I hope you enjoy!<br /><br />🌲 Shop my favourites 🌲<br />🌱Seeds - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.whipbirdenvironmental.com.au/shop">https://www.whipbirdenvironmental.com.au/shop</a> use code: NATUREPATCH5 for discount<br /><br />__________________________________________________<br /><br />Hey there!<br /><br />Welcome to my channel, The Nature Patch where I like to share all things gardening, cooking and environmental science in my Australian bushland backyard in south coast NSW. <br /><br />My name is Robyn, an environmental scientist working towards completing a PhD in understanding how people's wellbeing and their connection to nature is impacted by land use change. I've always loved gardening and nature and lately have been interested in growing my own organic food!<br /><br />On this channel you'll find videos relating to garden tours, 'how to' videos, composting, soil health, ecosystem services, and seed saving. <br /><br />I try to upload twice a week and I hope you enjoy!!<br /><br />🤎 Filmed and edited on Yuin country.
