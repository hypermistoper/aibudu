{% raw %}Formula, method and derivation to find the number of ways in which a positive integer can be expressed as a product of two co prime factors. Factors that are relatively prime to each - i.e., two factors whose HCF is 1.<br /><br />The Method<br />Step 1: Prime factorize the given number.<br />Step 2: Count the number of prime factors. Let us say the number has 'x' prime factors. Note, count only the prime factors.<br />For example, if the number is 28, it can be prime factorized as 2^2 * 7. 28 has 2 prime factors viz., 2 and 7.<br />Step 3: Number of ways of expressing the number as product of 2 co prime factors = 2^(x - 1), where x is the number of prime factors of the number.<br /><br />The video not just gives you this formula but also derives the formula provides the logic behind why the method works.<br /><br />Looking for more sample GMAT Number Properties practice questions?
