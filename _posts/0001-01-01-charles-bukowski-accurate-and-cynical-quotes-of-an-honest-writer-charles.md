{% raw %}Charles Bukowski was a prolific novelist, short story writer and poet who gained a cult status for his work that brought out his experience, emotion and imagination on paper. Unlike other contemporaries of his time, Bukowski was a natural at what he wrote. Through his autobiographical works, he did not try to make himself look heroic and instead plainly addressed the urban lives of Americans, the act of writing, his alcohol addiction, his relationship with women and so on. In his lifetime, he wrote several poems, short stories and novels, eventually publishing over sixty books. <br /><br />#CharlesBukowski #Bukowskiquotes #quotes #wellsaid{% endraw %}
