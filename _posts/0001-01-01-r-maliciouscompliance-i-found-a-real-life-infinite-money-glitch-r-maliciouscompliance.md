{% raw %}r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, OP discovers a way to turn $1 into $5! It's a bit complicated, but basically he buys a $1 cookie, which earns him $1 in points. Then he does some online magic to convert that $1 in points into $5 in Sears points, which allows him to spend $5 on whatever he wants in the store. He does this a thousand times and magically turns $1,000 into $5,000.
