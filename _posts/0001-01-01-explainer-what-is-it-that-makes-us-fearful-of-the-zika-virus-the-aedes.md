{% raw %}The Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have caused alarm in the past because they carry the disease dengue. Now since the birth of a growing number of babies with deformed brains, people are fearful of another disease this mosquito carries called Zika.<br />Zika is being linked to a malformation of the brain in the foetus and outbreaks in Latin American countries have led to women postponing pregnancies where possible.<br />Zika is not a deadly disease, most people appear to recover without long term effects, one in five donâ€™t even have symptoms.<br />There is no vaccine for Zika, and once the disease has struck there is little doctors can do to help the infants after they are born.<br /><br />Video Credits: AP<br />Music: BigBangfuzz{% endraw %}
