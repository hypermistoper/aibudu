{% raw %}As you may know by now, Boca Raton officials want to lease the last remaining green space in Downtown Boca Raton to the Hillstone Restaurant Group under a 45-year deal, depriving residents of access to their public space. If this effort is successful, the Wildflower Property will be converted into a high-priced restaurant that takes up 70% of the property’s green space and residents will lose this parcel of land forever.<br /><br />So why are special interest groups with little connection to the city trying so hard to defeat the Boca Raton Question on the November 8th ballot? <br /><br />It’s so they can develop any piece of land that remains in Downtown Boca Raton to turn a profit.<br /><br />Help prevent unnecessary development along our Intracoastal Waterfront by Voting Yes to the Boca Raton Question on the last page of the November 8th ballot.{% endraw %}
