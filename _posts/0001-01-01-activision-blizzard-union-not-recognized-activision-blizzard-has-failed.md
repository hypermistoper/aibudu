{% raw %}Activision Blizzard has failed to recognize the unionization effort of some QA employees at Raven Software.

Guess who will probably be the first to go now...?<br /><br />üçØ TIP JAR on Streamlabs:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://streamlabs.com/clownfishtvgaming1/tip">https://streamlabs.com/clownfishtvgaming1/tip</a><br /><br />üõí SHOP CLOWNFISH - Our Official Merch!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ShopClownfish.com">https://ShopClownfish.com</a><br /><br />About Clownfish TV:<br />Hosted by Kneon and Geeky Sparkles, Clownfish TV is an independent, opinionated news and commentary channel that covers Pop Culture from a consumer's point of view.
