Her favorite topic of conversation is her new dog and when she will be getting the next new dog. Jess collects CD‚Äôs of children‚Äôs music, cards, coloring books, and has a small collection of used up disposable cameras. Favorite health foods include chicken and rice, chicken tenders, chicken nuggets, chicken biscuits, pepperoni pizza, and hash brown potatoes. Jess has naturally curly hair that she would rather not ever comb, brush, or cut.<br /><br />Jessica‚Äôs multiple disabilities stem from brain damage that occurred in-utero, and from hydrocephalus. In addition to autism and blindness, Jess also has minor fine motor and gross motor deficits. Hannah is Jessica's sister, and Marlow is Jessica's paid support staff (and Hannah's best friend). Jess and Hannah also have a brother who lives in another state.{% endraw %}
