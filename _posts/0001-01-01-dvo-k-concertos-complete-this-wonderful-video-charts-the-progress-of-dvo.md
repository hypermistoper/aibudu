{% raw %}This wonderful video charts the progress of DvoÅ™Ã¡kâ€™s relationship with the concerto form over the course of his career, from the tentative but beautifully peaceful Piano Concerto of his early days to the masterwork that is the Cello Concerto, widely considered the greatest of all concertos for the instrument.<br /><br />Composer: AntonÃ­n DvoÅ™Ã¡k<br />Artists: Ruggiero Ricci (violin), Zara Nelsova (cello), Rudolf FirkuÅ¡nÃ½ (piano), Saint Louis Symphony Orchestra &amp; Walter Susskind (conductor)<br /><br />ðŸŽµ Online purchase or streaming (Spotify, iTunes, Amazon Music, Deezer): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://brilliant-classics.lnk.to/DvorakCompleteConcertosID">https://brilliant-classics.lnk.to/DvorakCompleteConcertosID</a><br />ðŸ’Ž More Information: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.brilliantclassics.com/articles/d/dvor%C3%A0k-complete-concertos/">https://www.brilliantclassics.com/articles/d/dvor%C3%A0k-complete-concertos/</a><br /><br />ðŸŽ¬ðŸŽ® All our tracks are available for sync licensing in videos, films, tv-shows, games, advertising and more.

The soloists in this collection are all veterans of their instruments who deliver exemplary performances, directed under the esteemed baton of Walter Susskind: &quot;In these Dvorak performances his great gifts as accompanist to elite soloistic talents is abundantly evident â€“ he was one of the great concerto conductors of his generation â€“ and the soloists respond in diverse ways, emotional, technical, expressive to the differing demands of the concertos&quot; (MusicWeb International).<br /><br />Tracklist:<br />Piano Concerto in G Minor, Op. 33:<br />0:00:00 I.
