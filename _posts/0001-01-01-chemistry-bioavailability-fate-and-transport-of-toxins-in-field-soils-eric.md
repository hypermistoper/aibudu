{% raw %}Dr. Eric Brevik, Professor of Geology and Soils, Dickinson State University, addresses the Conference on Connections Between Soil Health and Human Health, October 2018, in Silver Spring, Maryland. Dr. Brevik provides an overview of how heavy metals and an overabundance of other trace elements are found in soils and their effects on human health.<br /><br />The Conference on Connections Between Soil Health and Human Health was designed as a working meeting to provide a roadmap for collaborative, interdisciplinary leadership and exploration into the connections within and among soil health, the microbiome continuum from soil to plants to humans, food safety, human nutrition, fate and transport of human health-related substances in soil, and community health. Among those in attendance were soil health researchers, human health researchers, soil and medical science practitioners, public health experts, and agronomists. In addition, policy makers and representatives from soil health and human health research funding organizations discussed implications and opportunities for advancing research and societal benefits in this emerging field.{% endraw %}
