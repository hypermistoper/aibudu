{% raw %}Hi ðŸ˜Š,<br /><br />Are you doing a God thing or a good thing? Sometimes it is hard to distinguish the one from the other. It is important to ask Jesus what it actually is that He wants us to do and put our hands too. If we are not clear regarding what He asks, then at times we end up doing a good thing more than the God thing which can weary and tire us out. I believe this word from the Lord will be a confirmation and an encouragement to many of you, particularly leaders in the body of Christ.<br /><br />If you have any prayer requests, fill in the prayer request form on the website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.boldexistence.com.au/prayer-request/">https://www.boldexistence.com.au/prayer-request/</a> <br /><br />If you would like to sow into this ministry, you can make a contribution online by clicking the link below.
