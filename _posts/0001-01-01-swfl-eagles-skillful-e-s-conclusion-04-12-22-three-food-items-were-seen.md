{% raw %}Three food items were seen while I was at the nest this morning. M15 brought a fish and a squirrel to the pond area and E20 claimed both. Each item E20 smartly carried away from sibling E19, going first to the leaning palm and then the nest both times. E19 spied carrion in the west pasture, flew there and was seen eating it on the ground. Congratulations E19 on successfully foraging for your own food. While both E's were on the ground, a sub adult flew close to them (most likely checking to see if the E's had food) and Harriet appeared out of nowhere to protect her E's and defend her territory. She chased the SA (sub adult) from the pasture but he/she returned to fly at a perching Harriet. Harriet once again chased the SA  who returned to perch in a front west pasture pine tree. When M15 brought the squirrel, Harriet secured the pond area from the SA flying there. The E's chased each other in the air, on the ground and off and on the fence. E19 is 106 days old and E20 is 105 days old.<br />Thank you SWFEC, hosted by Dick Pritchett Real Estate, for providing &amp; maintaining suitable trees &amp; environment for this Bald Eagle Family. www.SWFLEagleCam.com <br />Thank you to Dick Pritchett Real Estate (SWFEC), Church of the Nazarene, Eagle Landing &amp; several friends for allowing me to film on their premises.{% endraw %}
