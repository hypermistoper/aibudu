{% raw %}Download a printable quadrant: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.davidcolarusso.com/handouts/quadrant.pdf">http://www.davidcolarusso.com/handouts/quadrant.pdf</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Note: the animation has an issue when showing the months and the Earth's tilt over the year. Namely, the months listed don't line up correctly with the angles shown. <br /><br /><br />Learn how to find south, your latitude, and your longitude with only a few household items and some know how. I should note, however, that in using the home-made quadrant cited, the precision of your findings will be rather low. Don't worry, you'll be within a few hundred miles. ;)<br /><br /><br /><br />The Tabletop Explainer is an intermittent educational vlog presenting answers to viewer questions, brief science lessons, and ideas for teachers and students.
