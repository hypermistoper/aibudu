{% raw %}Here's a relatively basic ILS approach at Baltimore to look at how this approach is flown. One area of confusion is in where exactly to intercept the glideslope on the approach. The approach plate makes the glideslope intercept clear with the thunderbolt symbol, but the AIM provides a bit of leeway in intercepting early, with a good amount of caveats. Let's explore this, as well as typical ways we receive our approach clearance from ATC.<br /><br />IFR Ground School is in session now!
