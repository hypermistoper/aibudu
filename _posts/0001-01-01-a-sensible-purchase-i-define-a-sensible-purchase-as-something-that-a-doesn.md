{% raw %}I define a sensible purchase as something that A) doesnâ€™t go out of style, B)you can see wearing in many different ways, C) makes your heart sing. This fabulous Michael Morrison vintage belt checked all the boxes ðŸ™ŒðŸ™Œ.  Don't save your pennies for that black cashmere sweater. Save it for the pieces that will say a little bit about you. Lean in and cultivate your own style!<br /><br />Shop my look and similar pieces here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://liketk.it/3GOPV">https://liketk.it/3GOPV</a>{% endraw %}
