{% raw %}Private press UK freakbeat - reputedly 99 copies made to avoid tax. A superb slice of primitive mod sounds and a huge fave of mine since many moons ago!<br /><br />If you collect this kind of stuff on 45 - drop me a line as I quite often have similar records or spares for trade etc... If you played in the band or know a band member - please let me know. If you have the record at home and it's nothing you need to keep - please let me know. Thanks!<br /><br />All soundfiles are taken from the record depicted.{% endraw %}
