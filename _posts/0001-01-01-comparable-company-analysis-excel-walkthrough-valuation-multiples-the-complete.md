This is a relative valuation method, meaning it's based on the market as opposed to the intrinsic value of the target company. <br /><br />The following are the steps we take:<br />1. Select the comparable companies: find 5-10 companies that are comparable based on industry, growth, credit risk etc.<br />2. Gathering financials and calculating multiples: Find revenues, EBITDAs, earnings, etc. to calculate multiples such as EV/Revenue, EV/EBITDA, P/E etc.<br />3. Benchmark the multiples: calculate the average, median, high, low, and quartiles to see multiple ranges <br />4. Determine a valuation range: Calculate the enterprise or equity value and eventually reach an implied share price<br />5. Simplifications for the model: Factors we need to consider such as calendarization, shares outstanding etc. <br /><br />You can follow along and practice using the excel valuation template above.  <br /><br />LEARN:<br />LEARN:<br />📈 The Complete Finance &amp; Valuation Course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://learn.careerprinciples.com/courses/finance-valuation-course">https://learn.careerprinciples.com/courses/finance-valuation-course</a><br />👉 Excel for Business &amp; Finance Course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://learn.careerprinciples.com">https://learn.careerprinciples.com</a><br />📊 Get 25% OFF Financial Edge Using Code KENJI25: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3Ds47vS">https://bit.ly/3Ds47vS</a><br />📝 Investment Banking Recruiting Course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://learn.careerprinciples.com/courses/the-complete-investment-banking-recruiting-course">https://learn.careerprinciples.com/courses/the-complete-investment-banking-recruiting-course</a><br /><br />SOCIALS:<br />📸  Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kenji_expla...">https://www.instagram.com/kenji_expla...</a><br />🤳  TikTok - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kenjiexplains...">https://www.tiktok.com/@kenjiexplains...</a><br /><br />GEAR:<br />📹  My Favorite Books &amp; Gear: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kit.co/kenjiexplains">https://kit.co/kenjiexplains</a><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br /><br />Chapters:<br />0:00​ -​ What is a Comparable Companies Valuation?<br />1:49​ - Selecting the comparable companies<br />3:16​ - Gathering financials and calculating multiples<br />7:28​ - Benchmark the multiples<br />8:58​ - Determine a valuation range<br /><br />Disclaimer: I may receive a small commission on some of the links provided at no extra cost to you.{% endraw %}
