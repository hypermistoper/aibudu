{% raw %}What is the reason behind kids' misbehavior. Bachay zid/gusa/larai kiyun kartay hain???<br />When children become angry/ill mannered/behave badly, actually they show that they are in a growing stage. Children / kids are not fully developed mentally and intellectually. If they treat badlyØŒ it means they need to learn skills that are not developed yet. Little kids can't wait, They are not able / unable to communicate their disappointment in a respectful manner. They are not mature enough to control themselves in a difficult situation.<br />Parents should be aware of what their children need to grow in. Children develop / grow different skills in different periods of their age.<br /><br /><br />Attributions:<br /><br />a href='<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.freepik.com/photos/cover'">https://www.freepik.com/photos/cover'</a> Cover photo created by karlyukav - www.freepik.com /a<br /><br />a href='<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.freepik.com/photos/hair'">https://www.freepik.com/photos/hair'</a> Hair photo created by karlyukav - www.freepik.com /a<br /><br /> a href='<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.freepik.com/photos/school'">https://www.freepik.com/photos/school'</a> School photo created by cookie_studio - www.freepik.com /a<br /><br />a href='<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.freepik.com/photos/school'">https://www.freepik.com/photos/school'</a> School photo created by gpointstudio - www.freepik.com /a<br /><br />a href='<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.freepik.com/photos/love'">https://www.freepik.com/photos/love'</a> Love photo created by peoplecreations - www.freepik.com /a{% endraw %}
