{% raw %}This week, we look at every major news channel running amok with the recently resumed television ratings by the #BroadcastAudienceResearchCouncil. The clamour around which channel made it to the top was finally settled. Spoiler alert, it’s all of them. Arnab took the cake, of course, with a long and breathless name-calling tirade. <br /><br />When not claiming to be number one, news channels were busy playing sidekicks to the state machinery that put its entire weight behind the propaganda film of the year, #TheKashmirFiles. We look at their not-so-subtle PR campaigns, with a tadka of drama. And the complete decimation of the idea of “facts”, taken apart piece by piece, in relentless nightly tamashas.<br /><br />To recover from this din of disinformation, we spoke to a journalist who actually reported from Kashmir during the late ‘80s and ‘90s – Alpana Kishore, who worked for Newstrack. <br /><br />For those interested in engaging in the topic in a more detailed manner, here’s a few resources:<br /><br />NL Hafta: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.newslaundry.com/2022/03/26/hafta-373-the-kashmir-files-reportage-on-the-kashmiri-pandits-congress-partys-survival">https://www.newslaundry.com/2022/03/26/hafta-373-the-kashmir-files-reportage-on-the-kashmiri-pandits-congress-partys-survival</a><br /><br />Reporting from #Kashmir, 1989 to 1994: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/vb34Ap2muJI">https://youtu.be/vb34Ap2muJI</a> <br /><br />Companion piece recommended by Alpana Kishore:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.newslaundry.com/2022/03/25/who-will-tell-them-this-land-belongs-to-your-father-when-i-die">https://www.newslaundry.com/2022/03/25/who-will-tell-them-this-land-belongs-to-your-father-when-i-die</a> <br /><br />--<br />#TVNewsance is Newslaundry’s weekly media critique and political satire show.
