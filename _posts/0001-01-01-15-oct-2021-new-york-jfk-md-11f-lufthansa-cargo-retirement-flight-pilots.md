With anyone but the operating crew being banned from flying on cargo planes and with the MD-11F fleet being permanently retiring from service at Lufthansa Cargo in October 2021, Captain Axel, Senior First Officer GÃ¼nter and First Officer Simon stepped up and took the lead for the creation of this fantastic movie about one of LH's last MD-11Fs just before their permanent retirement. The routing Frankfurt - New York JFK - Frankfurt marks the last ever rotation of an LH Cargo MD-11F and so these fascinating three aviators decided to take you on a stunning trip from Germany to NY on their beloved threeholer just before it would have been too late. Enjoy super fun professionals and lots of stories about their beloved aircraft!<br /><br />For all filming conducted in security restricted and/ or safety relevant areas, all required approvals are obtained well before our on-site work starts.
