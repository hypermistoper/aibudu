{% raw %}Choosing a new dulcimer can be overwhelming, and many times I am asked to advise people on their choices.  This video provides sound comparisons among McSpadden, Blue Lion, Papaw's Dulcimers, Magowan Dulcimers, and Clemmer dulcimers made from a variety of woods.  In addition to choosing an instrument that has a sound that you find pleasing, be sure that a prospective dulcimer has high quality geared tuners, an action that is comfortable to you, and a 6-1/2 fret. I am always happy to talk to people about choosing a dulcimer, so feel free to contact me with questions.  But, in the end, it is all a matter of personal preference and finding the instrument that calls to you.  Please visit my website at www.LeeCagleDulcimers.com for more information or to purchase a McSpadden dulcimer.{% endraw %}
