Yet owning a dog is not without its challenges, and behavioral problems often top the list of reasons that people give away or abandon their pets. This is unfortunate, as any dog can be taught to behave, and in reality, many behavior problems come from the ownerâ€™s inability to train or socialize their pets appropriately. That said, some dog breeds are indeed more challenging to raise than others.
