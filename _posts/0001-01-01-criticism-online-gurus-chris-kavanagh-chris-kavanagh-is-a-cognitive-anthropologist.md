{% raw %}Chris Kavanagh is a cognitive anthropologist, and the co-host of the increasingly popular and influential podcast 'Decoding the Gurus'. This is a podcast that critiques many of the new breed of public intellectuals, including some who have been featured on Rebel Wisdom.<br /><br />Together with co-host, psychologist Matt Browne, they analyse the methods and messages of what they've described as 'secular gurus'.<br /><br />This is an important conversation, about the necessity of criticism, of what counts as good and bad faith, and how truth seeking gets warped.<br /><br />It's a controversial project for many, and in this conversation, Rebel Wisdom's David Fuller puts many of those criticisms to Chris directly. <br /><br />Alongside this video, David Fuller has written a detailed and exhaustive analysis on Substack, highly recommended to read: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rebelwisdom.substack.com/p/decoding-the-gurus-and-the-necessity?r=ye9pq&amp;s=w&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">https://rebelwisdom.substack.com/p/decoding-the-gurus-and-the-necessity?r=ye9pq&amp;s=w&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web</a><br /><br />Also referenced in the conversation are:<br /><br />An earlier recording with Chris 'Criticising the IDW': <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByZCCmQVPdg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ByZCCmQVPdg</a><br /><br />Chris's presentation of the 'Gurometer' at The Stoa: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EazLoBk9gA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EazLoBk9gA</a><br /><br />Peter Limberg's 'Memetic Tribes of Culture War 2.0' piece: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://medium.com/s/world-wide-wtf/memetic-tribes-and-culture-war-2-0-14705c43f6bb">https://medium.com/s/world-wide-wtf/memetic-tribes-and-culture-war-2-0-14705c43f6bb</a>{% endraw %}
