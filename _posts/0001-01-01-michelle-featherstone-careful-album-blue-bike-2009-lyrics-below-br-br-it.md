{% raw %}Album: Blue Bike (2009). Lyrics below.<br /><br />It's the little things<br />They pulled me in<br />And I'm defenseless<br />I try to ignore<br />Like i've done before<br />But it's just useless<br /><br />I've made up my mind<br />That I'm gonna let you in<br />And I'm not afraid<br />But I have to say<br /><br />This is gonna hurt<br />If it ever ends<br />But somehow you have shattered my defense<br />This is gonna hurt<br />If it ever starts<br />So promise you'll be careful with my heart<br /><br />It's the things you do<br />That made me fall hard for you<br />And I can't help it<br />And it's every day<br />That I feel this way<br />So just don't stop it<br /><br />I've made up my mind<br />That I'm gonna let you in<br />And I'm not afraid<br />But I have to say<br /><br />This is gonna hurt<br />If it ever ends<br />But somehow you have shattered my defense<br />This is gonna hurt<br />If it ever starts<br />So promise you'll be careful with my heart<br /><br />I won't make excuses<br />They just all seem useless<br />You don't have the time<br />I guess I'll take my chances<br />Now that I know love is on the line<br /><br />This is gonna hurt<br />If it ever ends<br />But somehow you have shattered my defense<br />This is gonna hurt<br />If it ever starts<br />So promise you'll be careful with my heart<br /><br />Careful with my heart{% endraw %}
