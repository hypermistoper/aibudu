{% raw %}From the Rubens debut album (2012)<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />Ain't no need for your guns here baby<br />You you drove me away, yeah you made me<br />Hate myself, hate my job, love my friends but lose their love<br />And it's hard, to know you're still around but you're not mine<br />Now you're having fun with a dead man's son cause' he pleases you<br />And you know he's no good for you, but yet you do<br />Call me up, to keep me up I know it's you<br /><br />You know, I won't have no pity, I won't shed no tears<br />Because I got, nothing to fear<br />Don't have no pity, don't shed no tears for me, not for me<br /><br />Don't tell me you tried to save me<br />You kid yourself you're just the same as me<br />In other times, in other ways, we'll spend our lives wasting away<br />And it's hard, to know you're still around but you're not mine<br /><br />Now I, told you once but I'll do it again<br />There's no way that we'll still be friends<br />I know it's still the same for you, cause you do<br /><br />Call me up, to keep me up, I know it's you<br />You know, I won't have no pity, I won't shed no tears<br />Because I got, nothing to fear<br />Don't have no pity, don't shed no tears for me, not for me<br /><br />Now you let me down, cause I let you down<br />Think it's best if I just left town<br />I'll find a place to settle down<br /><br />Don't call me up, to keep me up I'll know it's you<br />Yeah you call me up, to keep me up I know it's you<br /><br />I do not own the rights to this song<br />Enjoy!{% endraw %}
