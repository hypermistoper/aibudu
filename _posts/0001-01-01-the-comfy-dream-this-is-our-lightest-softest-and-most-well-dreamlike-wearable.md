{% raw %}This is our lightest, softest, and most, well, dreamlike wearable blanket yet! Gone is the multi-layered thickness of The Comfy® Original™(though the giant, one-size-fits-all dimensions stay the same); instead, The Comfy® Dream™ wearable blanket is a single layer of luscious microfiber that's so soft, you’ll feel like you’re wearing a baby blanket. Its lightness makes it perfect for wearing around the house, or even to take with you when you need your warmth to travel. Slip one on, and start living #TheComfyLife!™{% endraw %}
