Pathe Pictorial use the setting as a literal interpretation of the song - concrete and clay - get it?  In a follow on from the previous story a transistor radio is balanced on an oil drum to suggest that the workmen can hear this song on Radio Caroline.<br /><br />In this precursor to the pop video there are C/Us of the band members as they walk like wandering minstrels over the scaffolding and play their guitars amongst the sand and rubble.  Good shots of the band as they play and enjoy themselves immensely.  What a fantastic song!  The soundtrack has sound effects of building work laid over the top.  Ends with a pull back shot showing the band in the middle of the building site.  Fab!<br /><br />BRITISH PATHÉ'S STORY<br />Before television, people came to movie theatres to watch the news. British Pathé was at the forefront of cinematic journalism, blending information with entertainment to popular effect. Over the course of a century, it documented everything from major armed conflicts and seismic political crises to the curious hobbies and eccentric lives of ordinary people. If it happened, British Pathé filmed it.<br /><br />Now considered to be the finest newsreel archive in the world, British Pathé is a treasure trove of 85,000 films unrivalled in their historical and cultural significance.<br /><br />British Pathé also represents the Reuters historical collection, which includes more than 136,000 items from the news agencies Gaumont Graphic (1910-1932), Empire News Bulletin (1926-1930), British Paramount (1931-1957), and Gaumont British (1934-1959), as well as Visnews content from 1957 to the end of 1984.
