{% raw %}I hear people wish that that skills like gardening and cooking were taught in schools more. This week I'm visiting a school that takes that up a notch and teaches their kids how to keep honeybees.<br /><br />Open to students in year 6 (age 10+), the Buchan School's beekeeping club meets weekly to inspect the colonies, talk about honeybees, build frames, and even extract honey. The aim of the club is to support the bees, educate on their importance, and help kids get over their fears. Teacher Alan says that helping just one child overcome their fears of bees has made the club so rewarding for him.<br /><br />Special thanks for this video needs to go to Alan Macnair and the Buchan School. Both have been generous with having me visit their kids and programme and for allowing me to share it with you! Another big thank you goes to the kids in the beekeeping club -- thanks for sharing your enthusiasm for bees and for having me there with cameras in tow.
