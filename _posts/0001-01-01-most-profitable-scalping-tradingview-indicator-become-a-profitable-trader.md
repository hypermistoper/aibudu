When the lines in the chart cross, traders enter the trade. Hopefully, they will enter a nice price trend. As soon as the lines meet again, traders exit the trade. Then, they wait for the signals to reverse. This will help them get out of the trade when the market moves in the opposite direction. The strategy has proven effective for traders who have been successful with technical analysis.<br /><br />The most popular combination of price action indicators with SSL is ATR or Volatility. Some strategies recommend a momentum indicator. However, the two approaches have different merits and may not be right for everyone. Each one requires a different trading system and approach. It is important to test the two techniques thoroughly and make the right choice for your trading style. Here are some tips to use the SSL with price action indicators: Its downside is that it can lead traders down blind alleys. The main advantage is that it can pick up changes in direction, but they don't develop into trends.<br /><br /><br />🟢  Long :<br />Price above the SSL Channel and the Channel is GREEN.<br />HAMA Candles are in Green<br />Above the 100 EMA<br /><br />♦️ Short :<br />Price below the SSL Channel and the Channel is RED.<br />HAMA Candles are in RED<br />BELOW the 100 EMA<br />⚡SL : Placed on 100 EMA<br />💰 Take Profit 2:1<br /><br />NEW DaviddTech TEAM BONUS!!<br />🔶 Bybit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bybit.com/en-US/invite?ref=VMP0O">https://www.bybit.com/en-US/invite?ref=VMP0O</a> ($3’560 FREE)<br /><br /><br />🔷TradingView Black Friday deal : <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tradingview.com/gopro/?share_your_love=dave92355">https://www.tradingview.com/gopro/?share_your_love=dave92355</a><br /><br /><br />🔷Connect your TradingView to ByBit or Binance via wunderbit<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://trading.wunderbit.co/en/trader/register?ref=wbt6ef1d722">https://trading.wunderbit.co/en/trader/register?ref=wbt6ef1d722</a><br />🔷Connect your TradingView to  Binance via 3Commas : <br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://3commas.io/?c=tc453711">https://3commas.io/?c=tc453711</a><br /><br /><br />- Want To Win More Trades, Make More Money?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://trader.dev/">https://trader.dev/</a><br /><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />00:00 Intro (very important)<br />02:05 The Winning Trading Strategy<br />07:00 The Coded Trading Strategy<br />19:00 Let's Test 100 times<br />10:00  Scalping Trading My Thoughts<br />10:30 Conclusion<br /><br /><br />#trading #strategies #winrate #scalping<br /><br /><br />DISCLAIMER (read it please): Leverage trading is ONLY for EXPERIENCED TRADERS.
