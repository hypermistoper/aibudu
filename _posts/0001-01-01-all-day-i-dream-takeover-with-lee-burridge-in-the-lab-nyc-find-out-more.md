Now it takes place across the globe from New York to Los Angeles, from London to Moscow, Berlin to Beirut and beyond. Each lineup features a unique roster of respected artists, many of which have also released music on the ADID record label, including Jonas Rathsman, Gorje Hewek &amp; Izhevski, Lee Burridge himself and the most recent 'Underwater Rocket' EP from Sebastien Legér. The label embodies the distinctly emotive, melancholic, dreamy and driving house and techno that soundtracks the party series, which will be on full display when Lee Burridge takes over The Lab NYC.<br /><br />• • • <br /><br />On WAV, fans can discover new artists and follow their journeys through exclusive content, interactive live streams and behind-the-scenes clips.
