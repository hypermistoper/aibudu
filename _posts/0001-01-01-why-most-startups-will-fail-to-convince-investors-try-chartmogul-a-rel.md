In the US alone, over 5 million new business registrations happened in 2021, but less than 4,500 early-stage companies raised any venture capital. That is a mere 0.08%<br /><br />SO MANY companies are not venturing backable (one of the reasons we decided to pivot our product into something that any startup, not just venture-backable companies would find useful). <br /><br />So again, with that context here are some stats that show the reality of SaaS companies- courtesy of our friends at ChartMogul. <br /><br />--<br /><br />0:00 Raise Venture Capital - Intro <br />1:33 Raise Venture Capital - Fundraising Landscape<br />2:31  Raise Venture Capital - Growth<br />4:14 Raise Venture Capital - What drives that growth?<br /><br />-<br /><br /><br />Follow Caya:<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/cayahere">https://twitter.com/cayahere</a><br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/caya_here">https://instagram.com/caya_here</a>{% endraw %}
