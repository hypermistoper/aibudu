{% raw %}The five prayers are among the best acts of worship that Muslims perform. Performing them is the best deed after having the correct belief in Allah and His Messenger. Prophet Muhammad, may Allah raise his rank, was asked about the best deed and he replied: it is performing the obligatory prayers at the beginning of their setting times (al¬-Bayhaqiyy): Since the prayer is the most important matter of Islam after having the correct belief in God and His Messenger, one must plan his life around the prayer. It would be a great sin to neglect praying when at work if a prayer was required at that time. If a believer is shopping or waiting at the airport and there is no way to get home or to a mosque, he is still obligated to perform the prayer within its due time instead of purposely leaving it out or making it up after its due time is over. This indicates the importance of the obligatory prayer. Performing the obligatory prayer on time takes priority over other non-obligatory matters.<br />'Ayah 238 of Surat al-Baqarah means: “Perform the [five obligatory] prayers” <br /><br />SoundCloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/2mfm/the-five-obligatory-prayers">https://soundcloud.com/2mfm/the-five-obligatory-prayers</a><br />Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/j-hHgvpl_Ns">https://youtu.be/j-hHgvpl_Ns</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/sheikhbilalhomaysi/videos/479552729157016/">https://www.facebook.com/sheikhbilalhomaysi/videos/479552729157016/</a>{% endraw %}
