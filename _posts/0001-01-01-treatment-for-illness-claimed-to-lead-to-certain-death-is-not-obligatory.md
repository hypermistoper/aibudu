{% raw %}Question: What is the ruling of leaving off treatment for illnesses that if they are left without treatment will result in certain death such as kidney failure or treating clogged arteries and other than that which has become easy to treat in this time. Is it obligated upon him to treat it or not?<br /><br />Answer: Treatment is not obligatory in accordance to the Jumhūr (majority of the scholars of Islām). It is not obligatory but rather it is Mubāḥ (an allowable action were you to do it or abandon it; there is neither punishment or reward attached to it).<br /><br />And it is up to him (i.e. his choice) to leave it off.<br /><br />As for his saying that it would lead to certain death, then this is not correct, for it is possible that Allāh cures him. And how many a sick person reaches an age and we find that the doctors lose hope for him and he loses hope in the doctors and Allāh, the Most High, cures him.<br /><br />As for that which is said: “This is an illness which will most certainly lead to death”, then this not correct.<br /><br />And if he dies then all praise is due to Allāh, (he dies) upon the religion of Islām.{% endraw %}
