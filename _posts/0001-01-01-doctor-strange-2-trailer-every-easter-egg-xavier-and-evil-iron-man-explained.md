We finally get a few plot reveals of the Sam Raimi directed sequel, and extended looks at the litany of guest stars: Wanda Maximorff (AND the Scarlet Witch entity!), Future Young Avenger America Chavez, ZOMBIE Wanda from What If?, Strange Supreme, Defender Strange, Zombie Strange, and Charles Xavier, played by Sir Patrick Stewart!<br /><br />This not only means that mutants are in the MCU–but it also gives us the big screen version of the Illuminati. This Marvel team works behind the scenes, rigging events from the shadows. It normally consists of Professor Xavier, Red Richards, Tony Stark, Dr Strange, Namor, and Black Bolt. So we speculate about the members of this group. Marvel mainstays such as Loki seem likely, while we might be seeing the debut of an evil Tony Stark, played by Tom Cruise. <br /><br />If you're new, Subscribe! → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/subscribe-screencrush">http://bit.ly/subscribe-screencrush</a><br /><br />Go here → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://screencrush.com/">http://screencrush.com/</a><br />Like us → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ScreenCrush">https://www.facebook.com/ScreenCrush</a><br />Follow us → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/screencrushnews">https://twitter.com/screencrushnews</a><br />Get our newsletter → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://screencrush.com/newsletter/">http://screencrush.com/newsletter/</a><br /><br />Written and Hosted by Ryan Arey (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/ryanarey)">http://twitter.com/ryanarey)</a><br />Edited by Harriet Lengel-Enright, Sean martin, and Srinidhi Rao<br /><br />#DoctorStrange #MultiverseOfMadness #EasterEggs<br /><br />0:00 Easter Eggs and Strange Supreme Explained<br />2:34 America Chavez &amp; Young Avengers <br />4:04 Easter Eggs Part 2: Chaos Magic and What If…?

The key takeaway from this opening narration is that a stranger has a bad dream, but [when I wake up the nightmare begins] the reality strange is living in is worse than the dream itself. So we’re going to be seeing variants of stpoehen throughout the trailer–meaning we don't actually know which Benedict this is. MCU strange? Strange supreme form what if, more on him in a second-defender strange, with the ponytail–zombie strange–beach party strange?<br /><br />Having you lead play different characters gives the trailer a lot of opportunities to misdirect us, so bear that in mind as we go.<br /><br />The reason I think this may not be a nightmare is because this is very much like one of the realities we saw in what if. Now what if followed alternate realities where characters make a single choice that alters the path of their universe. In episode 4, we meet a version of Stephen Strange who is unable to save Christine from a car accident, so he dedicates himself to learning how to change the past. Which the ancient tells him not to do, because it is an absolute point in time. So Stephen fights all these monsters, absorbing their power until he becomes a monster himself. He is able to reverse the absolute opinion time, but as a result his universe is engulfed by black goo. Similar to the good esee engulfing universes throughout this trailer.<br /><br />Now the series ends with a strange supreme atoning for his sins, by watching over a couple guys fighting over infinity stones in jar–long story. But I’m wondering if this at the end of reality was given to him as  a place where he could watch over these two guys in a jar.<br /><br />Or maybe this is a dream, and Stephen is able to communicate with his other self through some sort of psychic bond, Like a strange supreme is warning this range of the dangers to come.<br /><br />That episode of what If did also saw the ancient one splitting off the timeline into parallels, so Strange could try to reason with himself–so strangers across all realities could share some sort of connection.<br /><br />The channel heavy spoilers pointed out that this version of strange represents ultimate chairs, while defender strange–who we see later–represents ultimate order. <br /><br />Then we are introduced to America Chavez, bound by these same columns that we see here in the foreground.<br /><br />America Chavez, in the comics–is super strong, is near invincible, and has the ability to open up portals across universes. In the trailer you see her doing this, opening up a portal behind her to escape these columns. But I’ll talk more about this place and what it means later in the video.<br /><br />She’s got a bonkers origin story that I won;t go into detail on right now, but the important thing to know is that she is a key member of the young avengers. We’ve talked about him on the channel a lot, but the young avengers are slowly being introduced in new marvel tv shows and movies, and the team also includes wanda’s twins–who very well could return at the end of this movie.{% endraw %}
