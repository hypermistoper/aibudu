{% raw %}Hi! In this video I talk about Outlining! How I do it and why I think it's a good method. The video is mainly about the process, not the how-to. I talk about outlining twice, once before the first draft and once after the first draft. <br /><br /><br /><br />ABOUT THE CHANNEL<br />This channel is about storytelling. Every other week I shared my thoughts on either film, tv-shows, books, screenwriting, cinematography, and more! From time to time I do more in-depth Video Essays and Courses on screenwriting.
