{% raw %}I bought a 7x7 plastic shed from Home Depot, and while it works pretty well, I wasn't satisfied with the sturdiness. In this video I show how I reinforced the shed with 8 2x4x8's to make the shed much less wobbly, as well as providing anchor points for shelving solutions like Fasttrack. So not only did this make the shed much stronger, it also provided the ability to more efficiently store our junk in the shed.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br
