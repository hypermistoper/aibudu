{% raw %}This lesson focuses on the unstressed vowel sound (/ə/ the schwa) in British English. As you may know, English is a rhythm-stressed language, so only the important words in a sentence (the nouns, verbs, etc) are usually stressed. This means, therefore, that lots of words and vowel sounds in a sentence are unstressed....and if you want to speak better English, you need to practice this /ə/ sound.<br /><br />If you can practice saying these unstressed vowel sounds and words, your spoken English will improve and you will begin to sound more like a native speaker. Plus, once you can recognise these different stress patterns, your Listening Comprehension will improve, too.<br /><br />If you want to ,improve your English pronunciation, speak better English and learn about the unstressed vowel sound /ə/, this Easy-Peasy English lesson can help...and Geoff explains everything simply and easily in under 8 minutes. <br /><br />Uncle Geoff is a TEFL teacher who LOVES English grammar and English pronunciation.
