{% raw %}A 34-year-old paralyzed man who lost the ability to even move his eyeballs can communicate now, say scientists involved in a study. The patient was diagnosed earlier with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis which leads to progressive degeneration of brain cells involved in motion. A biomedical engineer, Ujwal Chaudhary, at the University of Tubingen says his experiment has made it possible for the patient to communicate again. <br />#Stroke #Brain{% endraw %}
