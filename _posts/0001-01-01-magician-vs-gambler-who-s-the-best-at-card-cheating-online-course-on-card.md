by using them, you help out the channel. Thanks! <br /><br />NOTE:<br />Obviously, this video contains a series of gambling demonstrations meant to be at least semi-accurate, but mostly entertaining. This is NOT meant to be an instructional video on how to cheat at cards or on how to protect yourself from cheating. Don't watch this video and then try this stuff in a game or think you can’t be cheated. I make these videos for entertainment so that people can more deeply appreciate the craft and the art of sleight-of-hand. If you find this stuff interesting, go check out the work of people like Steve Forte, Jason England, Richard Turner, Darwin Ortiz, and Jason Ladanye. If you want to learn how to protect yourself at the card table, check out “Casino Game Protection,” “Poker Protection,” and “Gambling Protection Series” by Steve Forte and “Gambling Scams” by Darwin Ortiz. <br /><br />CREDITS:<br />Ambitious Card: The ambitious card phase Kim performs comes from the work of Chad Nelson, though my &quot;recreation&quot; is based on different techniques.<br />Center Deal Demonstration: This center deal demo was created by Steve Forte and can be found in his Gambling Sleight of Hand books.<br />Hand Muck: Kim and I learned this specific muck from the Darwin Ortiz on Card Cheating DVD.<br />Push-Off Second Deal: For more information on this technique, check out the work of Jason England and Steve Forte.<br />Five Faces of Sybil: This flourish was created by Chris Kenner and widely popularized by Dan and Dave Buck.<br />Dead Cut: The various demonstrations we perform are based on a concept brought to the world of magic by Dai Vernon, which can be found in his Inner Secrets of Card Magic trilogy. The specific routine I perform is based on Pit Hartling's routine Finger Flicker from his book Card Fictions. The version that Kim performs is based on Darwin Ortiz's routine Sudden Impact from his book Lessons in Card Mastery.{% endraw %}
