{% raw %}Peter Schiff is an investor, CEO and millionaire about economics, money, billionaires and bitcoin! Peter also talks honestly throughout the episode about his thoughts on the US government and how they have been harming the economy, every day US citizens and the impact this has had on the rest of the globe.<br /><br />#PeterSchiff #Inflation #BITCOIN<br /><br />Full Uncensored available here <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://rob.team">http://rob.team</a><br /><br /><br /><br />You can‚Äôt consume if you don‚Äôt produce and this has been one of the issues with government policies ‚Äòpatching up‚Äô the economic shortfalls and delaying the inevitable.¬†<br /><br />Peter Schiff learnt the title of Dr Doom in 2005 when he was predicting a massive economic crisis. It turns out he was right, he was really Dr Reality and he now predicts another imminent crash.<br /><br />If you recognise the state of the economy right now and understand what is going to happen in the near future you can position yourself to at least ride the storm and potentially even profit from what is going to happen. There are always some winners in economic crisis‚Äôs, fortunes can be made.<br /><br />When money originated, it was created out of metal, it had real value. The devaluation of money started in the 1970‚Äôs, what we now use as money isn‚Äôt a real ‚Äòcommodity‚Äô. Eventually with the printing of money that is widespread in many western economies the trust in it will disappear and that‚Äôs when we will be in real trouble. It sounds extreme but It‚Äôs not unprecedented, many countries that have been wealthy in the past have devalued their currency.<br /><br />Although Peter has ran under the Republican party previously he actually aligns himself as a Libertarian. He believes at the moment both the Republicans and Democrats are in difficult places and aren‚Äôt true to their core belief systems.<br /><br />Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies have had a lot of hype the past couple of years. Peter thinks they have had their day and will start to drop. He advises people to get out of bitcoin and other cryptos now.<br /><br />People will take opportunities and liberties where they can. Peter doesn‚Äôt blame the likes of Elon Musk and other billionaires for not paying more tax, he blames the government and the policies that allow this.<br /><br />Disruptors Podcast Links <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/robmoore">https://linktr.ee/robmoore</a><br />‚òë iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/tde/id1076679649">http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/tde/id1076679649</a><br />‚òë Stitcher: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://stitcher.com/s?fid=81510">http://stitcher.com/s?fid=81510</a><br /><br />Rob is dedicated to helping entrepreneurs to succeed and has written many books with this aim.<br /><br />See all of Rob's books here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://robmoore.com/podbooks">https://robmoore.com/podbooks</a><br /><br />Join the Facebook Group <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/DisruptiveEntrepreneursCommunity/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/DisruptiveEntrepreneursCommunity/</a><br /><br />Business &amp; Entrepreneur Hacks &amp; Advice<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz2WYJdjwXSLb2c6HlltZVD1gOlYKDu9Q">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz2WYJdjwXSLb2c6HlltZVD1gOlYKDu9Q</a><br /><br />Interviews Playlist<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz2WYJdjwXSLk9001f7STjVO3famcEN75">http://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz2WYJdjwXSLk9001f7STjVO3famcEN75</a><br /><br />Get access to the exclusive YouTube membership<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLtKal0qTf3klDUr7JS_L9Q/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLtKal0qTf3klDUr7JS_L9Q/join</a><br /><br />üîó <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thedisruptiveentrepreneur.co.uk">http://thedisruptiveentrepreneur.co.uk</a><br /><br />The Disruptors podcast world disruptors plus Rob's own detailed critical analyses of all areas of entrepreneurship &amp; business. <br /><br />‚ùùIf you don‚Äôt risk anything, you risk everything‚ùû - Rob Moore{% endraw %}
