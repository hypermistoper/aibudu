{% raw %}As long as our journey to Cape Town is suspended, due to the COVID 19 virus, we’ll continue with making videos about the preparation of our trip. It’s great fun, especially this video! We went for a weekend trip to a driving skill centre and combined it with a visit to our local motorcycle dealer where we tell you about our riding gear and the modifications we made on our Yamaha Ténéré 700’s. <br /><br />Saturday morning we first rode to Gebben Motoren, which is only 15 kilometers from our home. It’s always nice to visit them, in Dutch we say it’s always “gezellig” here. After we made the footage for the riding gear and the modifications on the bikes, we went on to the province of Flevoland where the driving skill centre is located. We found ourselves a great camping spot. The place gave us the feeling we were somewhere far from home, because of the lovely field with apple and pear trees. <br /><br />The next morning it was close to the circuits of the driving skill centre. It was a full day of motorcycle gymnastics in extremely hot conditions for our country. After a full day of improving our driving skills, we came home satisfied and exhausted! <br /><br />- - - - - <br /><br />In the next episode we will take you with us on our trip to Corsica and the Alps, where Jessica rode her first mountain pass and Maarten made his first scuba dive. If you are wondering if we had a good time on this trip, stay tuned! <br /> <br />- - - - - <br /><br />Follow us on:  <br /> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/windingwheels/">https://www.instagram.com/windingwheels/</a>  <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/windingwheelss">https://www.facebook.com/windingwheelss</a>  <br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://windingwheels.nl">https://windingwheels.nl</a>  <br /> <br />#windingwheels #motorcycleadventure #yamahamotor #revsyourheart #moskomoto #revitadventure #tenere700 #xladv #motorcycle #traveling #adventureready #ridinggear #motorcyclemodifications #drivingskillcenter #motorNL #circuit #exhausted{% endraw %}
