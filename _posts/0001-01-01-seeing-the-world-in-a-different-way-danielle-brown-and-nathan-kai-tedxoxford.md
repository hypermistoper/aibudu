{% raw %}Be Your Best Self is a speaking duo made up of Paralympic gold medallist Danielle Brown and 11-year-old neurodiverse multi-medallist in Jiu-jitsu Nathan Kai.<br /><br />Danielle is a double Paralympic gold medallist, five times World Champion and the first disabled person to represent England at the Commonwealth Games (and win gold) as an able-bodied athlete. Nathan joined MENSA in 2016, is a Grade 5 pianist, and at the age of 7 began writing Be Your Best Self. In 2017, he became the World's Youngest Self-Development Author for his book Be Your Best Self: Life Skills for Unstoppable Kids. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
