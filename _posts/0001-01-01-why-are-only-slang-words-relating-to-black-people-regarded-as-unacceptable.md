{% raw %}The current obsession with what is coyly referred to as the ‘N word’ is reaching ridiculous lengths, with books such as Tom Sawyer and To Kill a Mockingbird being denounced for containing this dreadful expression. Once again though, we observe that it is only the sensitivities of black people which must be protected. Racial slurs against any other ethnicity are simply ignored and nobody worries about them.{% endraw %}
