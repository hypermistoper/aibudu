As I have a history of building the biggest projects on YouTube (SpongeBob's House in my Backyard, Real Life Technoblade, Giant Cereal Bowl in my Bedroom, and a Real Life Squid Games Doll), I knew I couldnâ€™t say no. Little did I know what building a toilet 20 feet tall was nearly impossible so this was extremely difficult to make. However, the amazing Beem Team worked some magic and made the impossible possible once again. Upon completion, we still had to drive it to California to surprise Amp World with it. He was AMAZED at how good it turned out! This was a real challenge to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. <br /><br />If youâ€™re reading this youâ€™re a real one! <br />Comment â€˜â€™Sittin On Tha Toilet!&quot; so I can notice you!<br /><br />Not LAST TO LEAVE GIANT TOILET WINS $10,000!!, But SURPRISING MY FRIENDS WITH THEIR FAVORITE SINGER, But ****Never Have I Ever, But Pause Challenge, But Little Sister, But Pranking, But $10,000, But Crazy Dares, But Last to Leave, But 24 Hours, But 50 Hours, or any other video like Brent Rivera, Ben Azelart, Lexi Hensler, Lexi Rivera, Stokes Twins, Jeremy Hutchins, Andrew Davila, Dom Brack, Mason Fulp, Pierson, or Amp World would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10) surprises Brent Rivera with the worldâ€™s largest toilet!{% endraw %}
