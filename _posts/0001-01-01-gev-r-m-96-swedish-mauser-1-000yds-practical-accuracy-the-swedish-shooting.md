While the rifle hails from neutral Sweden, it has seen plenty of action, especially in the Finnish Lapland during the Winter War against Soviet Forces. <br /><br />But there is much more that goes into the history and tradition of the Sweedish Shooting Movement that has popularized the Swedish Mauser and the 6.5x55mm Swede. <br /><br />As an early adapter of the 6.5mm caliber projectiles, Sweden enjoyed a very long service life from the caliber, and technically has it serving in the hands of the Swedish Royal Guards. It is an effective military, civilian sporting and hunting cartridge. When loaded to M41 standards, it is especially noted for it's low recoil, extreme accuracy and long range flight characteristics. <br /><br />In this episode, we shoot the course with a 122 year-old Gev√§r M/96, beautifully loaded Lapua 6.5x55mm cartridge, and Karl, our Swedish Army Marksman instructor tells us about the rich history of the Swedish Shooting Culture<br /><br />Special thanks: <br />Mike B - @Mike B (Milsurp stuff)<br />Henrik - @Hagge B√§nke (STR-200 footage)<br />Karl <br />Jenny - IG @Jenkarolina<br />C&amp;Rsenal - @C&amp;Rsenal <br />Forgotten Weapons - @Forgotten Weapons <br />@Tyops for the music!<br /><br />Consider supporting us via Patreon üëâ  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/9HoleReviews">http://www.patreon.com/9HoleReviews</a> (you an also access the Practical Accuracy Scoreboard here)<br /><br />Observer setup seen here powered by: <br />- Vortex Optics Razor HD Spotting Scope 27-60x85 Angled<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2M3zTGP">https://amzn.to/2M3zTGP</a><br />- Vortex Optics Pro GT Tripod<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2X7j6sL">https://amzn.to/2X7j6sL</a><br />- Phone Skope Lollipop Universal Digiscoping kit<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZK50zk">https://amzn.to/2ZK50zk</a><br /><br />We have a discount for Slate Black Industries MLOK accessories! <br />üëâ www (dot) slateblackindustries (dot) com <br />Discount code: 9HOLE<br /><br />Shopping with this link costs you nothing, but provides us with equipment: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/?tag=sbi09-20">https://www.amazon.com/?tag=sbi09-20</a><br /><br />This video's editing by Agency Communications LLC<br />Music by Tyops (THANKS!!!)<br /><br />__________________________________________________________________<br />We love mail:<br />9 Hole Reviews<br />21175 Tomball Pkwy.
