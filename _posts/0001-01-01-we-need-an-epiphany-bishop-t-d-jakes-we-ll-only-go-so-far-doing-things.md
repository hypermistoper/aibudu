{% raw %}Weâ€™ll only go so far doing things our way. When pride gets in the path of our progress, we find ourselves getting comfortable amid our dysfunction. Like the prodigal son in Luke 15:11-24, who realized he was living beneath himself, God will release an epiphany that proves we can live another way. Thereâ€™s greater in store for us, but we wonâ€™t get there until we decide to get up! It doesnâ€™t matter how far weâ€™ve gotten off track; thereâ€™s always more than one way to get back home. <br /><br />Subscribe to the official T.D.
