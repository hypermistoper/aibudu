{% raw %}COMING SOON<br /><br />Purchase from: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/shop/modules/viper/">https://www.digitalcombatsimulator.com/en/shop/modules/viper/</a><br /><br />In this DCS: F-16C Viper video, weâ€™ll look at the dive toss, or DTOS, bombing mode. DTOS allows you to designate a ground location as the Sensor Point of Interest, or SPI, through the HUD or HMCS. This designation can then be used for a CCRP attack using unguided and laser-guided weapons.<br /><br />DTOS mode can be selected as a bombing mode from the SMS page at OSB 2 or cycled to using the nosewheel steering / missile step button on the control stick.<br /><br />With DTOS selected and the HUD as the Sensor of Interest, or SOI, a 10 milliradian box is slaved to the flight path marker. You can then either TMS forward to ground stabilize its location or use the radar cursor switch to slew the box and then TMS forward to ground stabilize.<br /><br /> Alternatively, you can set the HMCS as SOI and either ground stabilize the DTOS cue based on the aiming cross or slew and then TMS forward to ground stabilize.<br /><br />In both HUD and HMCS cases, TMS Aft will slave the DTOS cue back to the flight path marker or aiming cross.<br /><br />Once ground stabilized and designated, the location is designated as the SPI and standard CCRP steering is provided. When wishing to conduct a visual CCRP attack through the HUD or HMCS, this is the preferred method. <br /><br />As this will also create a SPI, the targeting pod and Maverick would be handed off to it.<br /><br />Key Commands:<br /><br />Nosewheel Steering / Missile Step Switch: s<br />Target Management Switch (TMS) Forward: Right Ctrl + Up Arrow<br />Target Management Switch (TMS) Aft: Right Control + Down Arrow<br />Display Management Switch (DMS) Forward: Right Alt + ;<br />Display Management Switch (DMS) Aft: Right Alt + .<br />Weapon Release: Right Alt + Space Bar{% endraw %}
