{% raw %}Tousled Bob Haircut 2022,  Side Bangs Super Look With Wavy Ends.<br /><br />There is something about sleek side bangs and tousled mid-length hair that just works. The mix of textures does not feel disjointed thanks to the way the hairdresser has blended the ends of the bangs with the front layers.<br /><br />Naturally, wavy hair has the best of both worlds; straight and curly, with just the right amount of flyaways. But those can be dealt with. To create gorgeous medium hairstyles with any haircut, you just need a curling iron and some sea salt spray. And you are set!<br /><br />Medium hair might be considered &quot;safe&quot; by some and, sure, it's never going to be as dramatic as a buzzcut or as jaw-dropping as waist-length hair. But you can still have a heck of a lot of fun at the mid-length level.<br /><br />Mid-length hair is the best. While shorter haircuts often do not give the room to play around, longer ones usually go the traditional way and do not try anything new. Medium length, however, is the best hair length for you, as you can not only create many hairstyles, from edgy to feminine but also just leave it loose for a casual look. Overall, it is a good option while styling your hair. Medium haircuts are the same, convenient and cool.{% endraw %}
