This video is going to go over more changes coming to Wrath of the Lich King classic that you might not know about yet. And my goal is to highlight how the Wrath classic we’re going to experience in 2022 is not going to be the same as the Wrath we experienced back in 2008.<br /><br />First off, you’re probably wondering from the thumbnail what is Blizzard doing to Every Man for Himself? They’re renaming it! In Shadowlands they renamed Every Man for Himself to Will to Survive, and the same is being done for Wrath Classic – In a recent interview with IGN, Blizzard developers stated that they are trying to honor adjustments made to in-game text and character depictions to improve sensitivity and inclusivity. I’m not totally sure how that translates to this name change, but it definitely seems to make more sense for an ability that you usually use to break CC and you jump back into the fight – although it also makes sense to break CC and run away, which would fit the current name…<br /><br />Anyways, that’s what Blizzard has decided to do to the ability, and is just one more thing that makes Wrath Classic not the same this time around.<br />But that’s the only change: Blizzard has also mentioned they are looking to make adjustments to Raiding and Lockout Systems so players don’t feel obligated to run four versions of the same raid per week to optimize their character.<br /><br />With Wrath of the Lich King there are now 10-man versions of 25-man raids, introduced due to the popularity of Karazhan, the first 10-man raid in TBC. So, for Naxxramas for example, you’d have the 10-man version, 10-man heroic, 25-man, and 25-man heroic raids. If you wanted to fully optimize your character and increase your chances of getting gear, then you’d run all four. But it’s four runs of the same exact raid, and you can only run the same raid so many times before you’re sick of it. I think this has the potential to be a good change, but we’re going to have to see how Blizzard decides to make this adjustment – perhaps they are thinking of making them share a lockout for the 10 and 25-man versions, and you only run the same raid twice instead of 4 times.<br /><br />Something else that is really interesting is that the in-game barbershop can also change your characters gender– I’ve never been to a barbershop like that, but alright, suit yourselves. Male and Female are the only two options, by the way. This is actually a cool change, sometimes you think you do but you don’t and you change your mind about things. Like Blizzard changing their mind and bringing back Dungeon Finder…<br /><br />And, if you haven’t heard already everyone who has a character in Burning Crusade Classic MUST move on to Wrath of the Lich King Classic, as it will be happening automatically so there will be no so-called ERA servers for TBC classic, and when it comes to seasonal realms, much like Season of Mastery, but for TBC Classic – they have not ruled it out, but if it does happen, it won’t happen for a long time, says classic wow developers.<br />Besides recent Blizzard announced changes, there’s also the fact that server imbalance is so bad right now that the world PvP event – Wintergrasp – will be very different from before.<br /><br /> There was a buff the minority faction would get that would give them a better chance to win, but with the astronomical imbalance that we face today – that buff surely won’t be enough. And this is a really important world PvP event. By holding Wintergrasp you are able to buy gear, enchantments, and other miscellaneous items from vendors, and most importantly of all have access to the Vault of Archavon – a very important raid. <br /><br />This raid is very unique in that the gear you get from this raid includes PvP set pieces, in addition to PvE set pieces. I remember as someone who loves PvP I always made sure to do my Vault of Archavon lockout each week, for that chance of getting a PvP piece of gear instead of having to spam battlegrounds, or using arena points.<br /><br />#WotLK #WoW #WoWClassic{% endraw %}
