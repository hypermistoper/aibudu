{% raw %}Snapshot by Altus is a short, one-way video response tool, meant to provide an additional opportunity for schools to get to know you. Along with the CASPer test and the Duet, Snapshot is part of the Altus Suite, a multi-level assessment tool used by professional programs. <br /><br />Although Snapshot is not an in-person interview, you can still use traditional techniques and practices to get ready. Just like anything else you have to practice using realistic simulations and expert feedback.<br /><br />Many students experience anxiety before an interview, especially if itâ€™s a new and unknown format. Not knowing how you come across on a computer screen may also be a concern, since you want to make a great first impression with your recorded interview. Only mock interviews with expert feedback can reduce or eliminate these anxieties. Realistic mock interviews with expert, personalized feedback from a medical school advisor will help you work on how you come across and give you insight into the strength and quality of your responses. This feedback can help identify weaknesses, help you structure your answers, and most importantly, allow you to adopt a strategy to answer any type of question you may encounter. Remember, it's not about memorizing your answers or trying to guess what questions you will be asked. It's about mastering a technique to identify and answer any type of question that's thrown at you and to do it calmly and confidently. Confidence can't be taught, but it can be developed, and it can grow with medical school interview preparation.<br /><br />In this video, you will learn what the Snapshot is, what the interview process is like, and how to prepare for it. Finally, I'll go over some sample Snapshot questions and expert answers to help you get ready!<br /><br />Here's what we'll cover: <br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />01:39 - What is Snapshot by Altus?<br />01:59 - The Interview Format<br />04:23 - Snapshot Questions<br />05:47- How to Prepare for the Snapshot Interview<br />07:47 - Sample Snapshot Questions and Answers<br /><br />If you would like us to help you match to your dream program, contact us to schedule your free initial consultation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/casper-snapshot-prep?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=Snapshot-video&amp;sl=youtube-Snapshot-KSN2RlP3KMs">https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/casper-snapshot-prep?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=Snapshot-video&amp;sl=youtube-Snapshot-KSN2RlP3KMs</a><br /><br />// Resources //<br /><br />Snapshot by Altus<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/casper-snapshot?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=Snapshot-video&amp;sl=youtube-Snapshot-KSN2RlP3KMs">https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/casper-snapshot?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=Snapshot-video&amp;sl=youtube-Snapshot-KSN2RlP3KMs</a><br /><br />Altus Suite<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/altus-suite?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=Snapshot-video&amp;sl=youtube-Snapshot-KSN2RlP3KMs">https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/altus-suite?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=Snapshot-video&amp;sl=youtube-Snapshot-KSN2RlP3KMs</a><br /><br />Duet<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/duet?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=Snapshot-video&amp;sl=youtube-Snapshot-KSN2RlP3KMs">https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/duet?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=Snapshot-video&amp;sl=youtube-Snapshot-KSN2RlP3KMs</a><br /><br />CASPer Test Prep<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/free-sample-casper-questions?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=Snapshot-video&amp;sl=youtube-Snapshot-KSN2RlP3KMs">https://bemoacademicconsulting.com/blog/free-sample-casper-questions?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=video&amp;utm_campaign=Snapshot-video&amp;sl=youtube-Snapshot-KSN2RlP3KMs</a><br /><br />Don't forget to subscribe to our channel and follow us on Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter for more great med school application tips!<br /><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BeMoAcademicConsultingInc">https://www.youtube.com/c/BeMoAcademicConsultingInc</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bemoacademicconsulting">https://www.facebook.com/bemoacademicconsulting</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bemo_academic_consulting/">https://www.instagram.com/bemo_academic_consulting/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BeMo_AC">https://twitter.com/BeMo_AC</a><br />TikTok <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bemoacademicconsulting">https://www.tiktok.com/@bemoacademicconsulting</a><br /><br />Disclaimer: BeMo does not recommend, endorse nor affiliate with Altus Suite, Altus or McMaster and vice versa.
