{% raw %}Prepare for some dang foolishness. The world’s most expensive cars, covered in eye-melting livery, racing (and wrecking) on public roads because who cares about the rest of us peons, right? Except, don’t call it a race–it’s a rally. Maybe you heard about the time Johnny Knoxville nearly got creamed participating in it. Or how about the time its organizers took the action to North Korea? It’s a larger-than-life story with some larger-than-life personalities...This is everything you need to know to get up to speed about The Gumball 3000!<br /><br />There’s a new piece of iconic Donut artwork, have you heard?
