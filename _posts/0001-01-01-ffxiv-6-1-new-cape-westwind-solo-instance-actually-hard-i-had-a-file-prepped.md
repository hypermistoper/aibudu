{% raw %}I had a file prepped in advanced because it takes like an hour of New Game Plus to get to that point, and wanted to see what it's like. Later I'll have the Lahabrea fight at the end too.<br />Some things to note: Omni-positional hitbox on the mobs, and my character doing the slower weapon drawing animation that was implemented in Endwalker.<br /><br />0:00 - Start Cutscenes<br />2:36 - Phase 1<br />4:30 - Adds Phase<br />5:50 - Phase 2<br />7:54 - Mid-fight Cutscene<br />8:45 - Phase 3<br />9:44 - End Cutscenes{% endraw %}
