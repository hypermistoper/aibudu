Full lesson found at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/c64uf6">https://goo.gl/c64uf6</a> <br /><br />Visit the site for free guitar lessons, TARGET program, forum, community, and contests.<br /><br />San Francisco (Be Sure To Wear Flowers In Your Hair) is an American pop music song, written by John Philips of The Mamas &amp; The Papas and sung by Scott McKenzie. <br /><br />The song is in the key of G, using the I, IV, V and VI, and changes to the key of A at the end.  Even though the arrangement is easy, the student needs to be able to play barre chords from both the E and A families.<br /><br />The strumming is simple, should be done randomly and changes from the speed of 8th’s to the speed of 16th’s back and forth.  <br /><br />The lesson takes a look at how to dress up the playing by for example adding bounces into the strumming to give it a rhythmic feel. Copying the bass player for the last part of the song is also a nice addition to ones playing.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.TotallyGuitars.com">http://www.TotallyGuitars.com</a><br />- Complete Free Lessons<br />- Community<br />- Chat Room<br />- Forum<br />- Your Own Blog<br />- Recommend A Lesson<br />- Membership is free <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.TotallyGuitars.com">http://www.TotallyGuitars.com</a> join now!{% endraw %}
