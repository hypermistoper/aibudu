{% raw %}Just A Little - The Lotus <br /><br />Ah ah ah ah<br /><br />I can't stay, yes I know<br />You know I hate to go<br />But goodbye, love was sweet<br />Our worlds can never meet<br /><br />So I'll cry just a little 'cause I love you so<br />And I'll die just a little 'cause I have to go<br />Away<br /><br />Can't you see how I feel<br />When I say love's unreal<br />But goodbye, it's been sweet<br />Even though incomplete<br /><br />So I'll cry just a little 'cause I love you so<br />And I'll die just a little 'cause I have to go<br />Away<br /><br />Every night I still hear<br />All your sighs very clear<br />Now love's gone, gone away<br />As I once heard you say<br /><br />Now I've cried just a little 'cause I loved you so<br />And I've died just a little 'cause I had to go<br />Away{% endraw %}
