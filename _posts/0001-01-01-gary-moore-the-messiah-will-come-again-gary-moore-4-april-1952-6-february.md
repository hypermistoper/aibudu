{% raw %}GARY MOORE (4 April 1952 - 6 February 2011)<br /><br />In remembrance to one of my all time guitar heroes, who sadly passed away a year ago today. This remains one of my favourite performances by him and I can still remember buying the original version, written and recorded by Roy Buchanan, when I was still a 15 year old boy and starting out learning to play the guitar.<br /><br />This performance was recorded at the Montreux Jazz Festival in 1990 - a venue he revisited a number of times through the years.<br /><br />Gary, you are sadly missed.{% endraw %}
