Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg) and his stoically ever-professional captain, Raymond Holt (Andre Braugher), along with their diverse, lovable colleagues as they police the NYPD's 99th Precinct. In this final season of the series, Jake and the squad must try to balance their personal lives and their professional lives over the course of a very difficult year.<br /><br />Rounding out the ensemble is Sgt. Amy Santiago (Melissa Fumera), who has a passion for organization and a weakness for dork dancing; Lt. Terry Jeffords (Terry Crews), a mountain of a man whose most powerful muscle is his sweetheart; Jake's best friend and human puppy dog, Det. Charles Boyle (Joe Lo Truglio); and the incredibly secretive, tough-as-nails Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz). Also part of the Nine-Nine are veteran officers Det. Scully (Joel McKinnon Miller) and Det. Hitchcock (Dirk Blocker), whose only skill as police officers is their ability to make a passable pot of coffee.<br /><br />Created by Emmy Award-winning writer/producers Dan Goor and Michael Schur, &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot; won the 2014 Golden Globe Awards for Best Television Series - Comedy or Musical and Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series - Comedy or Musical (Samberg). Emmy winner Braugher earned four Emmy nominations for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series for his role as Capt. Holt.<br /><br />Brooklyn Nine-Nine<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/NBCBrooklyn99">https://www.youtube.com/NBCBrooklyn99</a>{% endraw %}
