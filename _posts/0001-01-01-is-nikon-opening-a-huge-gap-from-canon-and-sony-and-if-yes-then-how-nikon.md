{% raw %}Nikon, Canon and Sony are dominating the professional camera world, especially with the recent models announced.<br />We always want to know which one of the three is better, and I've noticed a gap opening up between the three, but where and how?<br />To be honest, I did receive the lenses from Nikon to test them out, but this is my honest opinion if I hadn't received anything. that's also why I encourage you to write me what you think and if you agree or disagree.<br />Tell me in the comments below what do you think? is this gap real and which system are you using?<br /><br />#wildlifephotography #nikon #canon #sony{% endraw %}
