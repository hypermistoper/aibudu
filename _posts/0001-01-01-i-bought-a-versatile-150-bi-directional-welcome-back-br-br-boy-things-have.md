{% raw %}Welcome back!<br /><br />Boy, things have been busy lately! This weekend we spent quite a bit of time wrapping up some projects at the dealership and managed to work on my new tractor for a little bit. I found this Versatile on Facebook and had it bought and drug home within a week. I first thought I may have bought a pile of junk, but after it fired up with minimal tinkering, I knew I made a good buy. I am hoping to do a multiple vide series on bringing this old tractor back to life.<br /><br />Thanks for watching, and I will see ya next time!{% endraw %}
