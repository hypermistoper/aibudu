We traveled from Phoenix/Tempe Arizona all the way to Los Angeles to come cash out and buy shoes at the largest sneaker and streetwear clothing event in California. This is one of the biggest vintage / shoe events in the East Coast, so naturally it's a great place to buy shoes. This Sneakercon had an NFT theme as we recognized popular art from Bored Ape Yacht Club all around. Our main buys in this video are the New Balance 550s, Jordan 1 Low Neutral Grey, Nike Off White Nike Dunks, Nike Dunk Low Parra, Jordan 1 Mids, Nike Dunks, Jordan 1 Lows, and more. We bought very selectively today, as we have a lot of inventory bought online and through our cashout Discord server. Sellers and vendors at Sneaker Con LA May 2022 were charging high prices, so we spent around $10,000. We do a segment called &quot;Lowballing Resellers&quot; and were able to get some pairs from that too. We also got the opportunity to meet so many of our fans and supporters and get great deals at these shows from vendors and resellers. Watch the full video to find out what we bought at Sneakercon Los Angeles and the prices we paid. A lot of subscribers told us at the event that our free sneaker investing advice has made them thousands of dollars in profits! The sneakers and vintage clothing we pick up are our best selling sneakers in our sneaker store. This event is similar to a Kobey's Swap Meet, Sneaker Exit or Got Sole. This is our second shoe convention of of May 2022. We hope you all enjoy the videos and thank you for the continued support! We will see you in a few weeks week at Boston Got Sole!<br /><br />If you guys are in the Phoenix, Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, Tempe or Scottsdale area in Arizona, come check out our shop located in Tempe!<br /><br />Dj Quads:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/aka-dj-quads">https://soundcloud.com/aka-dj-quads</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DjQuads">https://twitter.com/DjQuads</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/djquads">https://www.instagram.com/djquads</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCusF...">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCusF...</a><br /><br />#SneakerEvent #ResellingShoes #SneakerconLA{% endraw %}
