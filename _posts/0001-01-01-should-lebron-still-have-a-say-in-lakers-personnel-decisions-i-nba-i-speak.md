{% raw %}LeBron James' season is reportedly over and he will finish with an average of over 30 points per game, but fall two games shy of qualifying for the scoring title. The King was also called out by CBS Sports who said that he deserves full blame for the Los Angeles Lakers' failures and should no longer have a say in the solution. Stephen Jackson joins Joy Taylor and Emmanuel Acho to discuss whether LeBron should still have a say on personnel decisions or not, along with who is to blame for LakeShow's collapse this season.<br /><br />#SFY #NBA #LeBronJames<br /><br />Download the free-to-play FOX Bet Super 6 app: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://foxs.pt/3z96p0j">https://foxs.pt/3z96p0j</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to get all the latest content from Speak For Yourself: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://foxs.pt/SubscribeSPEAKFORYOURSELF">http://foxs.pt/SubscribeSPEAKFORYOURSELF</a><br />The all-new FOX Sports App, built for the modern sports fan: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb">https://tinyurl.com/y4uouolb</a><br /> <br />►Watch the latest content from Speak For Yourself: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://foxs.pt/LatestOnSFY">https://foxs.pt/LatestOnSFY</a><br /><br />▶First Things First's YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST">http://foxs.pt/SubscribeFIRSTTHINGSFIRST</a><br />►UNDISPUTED’s YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED">http://foxs.pt/SubscribeUNDISPUTED</a> <br />▶The Herd with Colin Cowherd’s YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD">http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTHEHERD</a> <br />►FOX Bet Live’s YouTube Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE">https://foxs.pt/SubscribeFOXBETLIVE</a><br />►Club Shay Shay’s YouTube Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY">http://foxs.pt/SubscribeCLUBSHAYSHAY</a><br />►The Skip Bayless Show YouTube Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBESkipShow">http://sprtspod.fox/SUBSCRIBESkipShow</a><br />▶Titus &amp; Tate's YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTITUSANDTATE">http://foxs.pt/SubscribeTITUSANDTATE</a><br />►What's Wright? with Nick Wright YouTube Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://sprtspod.fox/whatswright/youtube">http://sprtspod.fox/whatswright/youtube</a><br /><br />See more from Speak For Yourself: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://foxs.pt/SFYFoxSports">http://foxs.pt/SFYFoxSports</a><br />Like Speak For Yourself on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://foxs.pt/SFYFacebook">http://foxs.pt/SFYFacebook</a><br />Follow Speak For Yourself on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://foxs.pt/SFYTwitter">http://foxs.pt/SFYTwitter</a> <br />Follow Speak For Yourself on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://foxs.pt/SFYInstagram">http://foxs.pt/SFYInstagram</a><br /><br />About Speak For Yourself:<br />Speak for Yourself is an hour and a half sports debate show starring our FS1 talent covering the day’s hottest topics in sports and offering their unfiltered takes.<br /><br />Should LeBron still have a say in Lakers personnel decisions?
