{% raw %}Russia air force delivered new blow as Ukraine shoots down one more helicopter.<br />A low-flying Russian helicopter has been gunned down by Ukrainian air defence after footage emerged showing an aircraft hitting the ground and exploding into a black plume of smoke.<br />A video released on social media captured two Russian Mi-24/35 helicopters flying metres above the ground in Ukraine while gunfire can be heard fired in their direction. While the first flies by unharmed, the second aircraft, partially hidden behind desolate houses, is brought to the ground, where it reportedly rolled over before the fuel tank exploded. A thick cloud of black smoke can then be seen rising above the site of the crash.<br />The footage follows the release of further video showing Russian aircraft flying perilously low to the ground near the small city of Kadiivka in eastern Ukraine.<br />Two helicopters, a Russian Ka-52 and Mi-35M, were caught on camera flying through the region, though neither appeared to be shot down.<br />The tactic of flying close to the ground is reportedly used to make it harder for opposing forces to accurately shoot at the aircraft.<br /><br />IMPORTANT! <br />-None of these images, music &amp; video clips were created/owned by us. -This video is purely fan-made, if you (owners) have seen your content and want to remove this video, please message us privately or mail us<br />JustFor12345xyz@gmail.com<br />before doing anything.
