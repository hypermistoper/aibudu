There was loud abrasive anger: Linkin Park, Staind and Eminem. Hyperactive teenaged immaturity: blink-182, Sum 41 and American Hi-Fi. Plus Max Martin-produced pop bubblegum: Britney Spears and N*Sync. And Andrew WK contained shades of all of the above. <br /><br />Heavier than almost anything else in the mainstream, but sugary sweet like the purest pop, his debut single was a Vodka Redbull smashed into your ear canal, an punishingly uplifting tune released in the aftermath of the worst tragedy to befall the US in living memory.
