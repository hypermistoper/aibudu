{% raw %}Zach Kornfeld from The Try Guys suffers from an autoimmune disease called Ankylosing Spondylitis. I realize it's a mouthful, so today I decided to react to a couple videos Zach as posted on the Try Guys channel as well as back on the Buzzfeed channel about his medical journey dealing with chronic pain, his experience with the medical system, and the reality of living with the disease to this day. We also discuss inflammation, Scoliosis, MRIs, Humira, physical therapy, Are there any other Try Guys videos you'd like me to react to? Let me know down in the comments if Ned, Eugene, Keith, or Zach has done anything else you'd like me to talk about!<br /><br />I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously. If there’s a subject you want me to discuss or something you’d like for me to react to, leave a comment down below. Many of my videos have been born out of suggestions directly from you, so don’t hold back!<br />-Doctor Mike Varshavski<br /><br />ZACH'S VIDEOS<br /><br />I Have An Autoimmune Disease • The Try Vlog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9iTfaYmH5E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9iTfaYmH5E</a><br />i'm getting worse (autoimmune update): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbu8LLDB2dU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbu8LLDB2dU</a><br /><br /><br />Help us continue the fight against medical misinformation and change the world through charity by becoming a Doctor Mike Resident on Patreon where every month I donate 100% of the proceeds to the charity, organization, or cause of your choice!
