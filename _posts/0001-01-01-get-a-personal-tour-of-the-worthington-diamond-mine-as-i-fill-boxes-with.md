{% raw %}The Worthington Diamond Mine is at one of the seven, known, diamond pipes located within three miles of Arkansas' Crater of Diamonds State Park.  Few people know where it is located and even fewer have seen this freshly uncovered, diamond deposit.  Join me now for a guided tour and watch me fill boxes with our diamond ore that I will mail out to people all across the USA.{% endraw %}
