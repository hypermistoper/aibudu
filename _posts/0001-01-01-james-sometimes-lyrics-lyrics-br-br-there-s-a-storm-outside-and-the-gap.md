{% raw %}Lyrics:<br /><br />There's a storm outside, and the gap between crack and thunder <br />Crack and thunder, is closing in, is closing in<br />The rain floods gutters, and makes a great sound on the concrete<br />On a flat roof, there's a boy leaning against the wall of rain <br />Aerial held high, calling &quot;come on thunder, come on thunder&quot;<br />Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul<br />Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul <br />It's a monsoon, and the rain lifts lids off cars<br />Spinning buses like toys, stripping them to chrome<br />Across the bay, the waves are turning into something else<br />Picking up fishing boats and spewing them on the shore <br />The boy is hit, lit up against the sky, like a sign, like a neon sign<br />And he crumples, drops into the gutter, legs twitching<br />The flood swells his clothes and delivers him on, delivers him on <br />Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul<br />Sometimes, when I look deep in your eyes, I swear I can see your soul <br />There's four new colours in the rainbow<br />An old man's taking Polaroids<br />But all he captures is endless rain, endless rain <br />He says listen, takes my head and puts my ear to his<br />And I swear I can hear the sea <br />Sometimes, when I look in your eyes I can see your soul<br />(I can touch your soul)<br />(I can reach your soul)<br />Sometimes{% endraw %}
