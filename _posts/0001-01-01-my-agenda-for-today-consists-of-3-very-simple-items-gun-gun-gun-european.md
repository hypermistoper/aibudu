{% raw %}European ports should be closed to Russian ships.<br /><br /><br />Flash statement from Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba and NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg.<br /><br /><br /><br />Ukrainian Foreign Minister Kuleba and NATO Secretary General Stoltenberg made a statement before the NATO Foreign Ministers meeting.<br /><br /><br /><br />Stoltenberg's statements are as follows:<br /><br /><br /><br />We appreciate the courage of the Ukrainian government and people. Every day you resist Russian attacks.<br /><br /><br /><br />NATO has provided training services to the Ukrainian army for years, Today we provide equipment support for the self-defense of the Ukrainian army.<br /><br /><br />In today's meeting, we will talk about the supply of weapons such as more defense systems and anti-tank systems to Ukraine. We see that the weapons supplied by NATO to Ukraine are effective in the field.<br /><br /><br /><br />I invited the Allies to provide more arms aid to Ukraine. Ukraine needs weapons to defend its country.<br /><br /><br /><br />The statements of the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Ukraine Kuleba are as follows:<br /><br /><br /><br />My agenda for today consists of 3 very simple items. Gun, gun, gun! The Ukrainian army and people have shown in recent weeks how they can fight and win. But we can't continue this without more guns.<br /><br /> If you buy more weapons, the Bucha massacre will not be repeated. The weapons that will be delivered to Ukraine today serve the purpose of peace. We do not accept the distinction between defensive and offensive weapons.<br /><br />Every weapon used by the Ukrainian army is defensive. Germany can do more, we are in talks with them about the supply of additional weapons.<br /><br />Sanction pressure was weaker last week. Now it has increased even more, but we cannot say that we are one hundred percent successful. An oil and gas embargo is necessary, European ports should be closed to Russian ships.{% endraw %}
