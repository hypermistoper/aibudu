Most men are just better at controlling or suppressing their emotions. It comes naturally to men. They were born like this, wired like this, and society even trains men to be like this. Will they ever open up to you? That’s another yes!<br /><br />In this video, I’ll give you the reasons why men act cold, hesitate to show their emotions, or refuse to show their weakness, and it’s not because they are heartless.
