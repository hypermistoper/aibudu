{% raw %}Hear how Dr. Marques, a talented behavioral therapist, teaches her patients to fight and become comfortable with their anxiety. She explains the biological background of anxiety, and how her family taught her how anxiety is a necessity, not something we should avoid. Luana Marques is an Associate Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and president-elect of the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA). Recognized as a national and international expert in Cognitive Behavioral Therapies (CBTs), Dr. Marques teaches individuals how to utilize goal-oriented thinking and approach techniques to overcome their challenges and propel their lives. Dr. Marques’ book Almost Anxious educates the public about how worry and anxiety can interfere with happiness and productivity in their lives. At Massachusetts General Hospital, Dr. Marques’ research mission is to bridge the gap between science and practice in mental health by bringing evidence-based strategies to underserved populations. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
