{% raw %}Six-piece fly rods have been immensely popular the last years, and you may have noticed that we have a large selection of 6-piece double hand fly rods like the NT8, LPX Chrome and Elevation T-Pac. <br /><br />Of course they are great for travel, but Guideline product manager Leif Stävmo also has a theory on the added action qualities of 6-piece fly rods that's been sticking with him for a long time. Leif take us back 20 years in time when the classic 3-piece LeCie double hand rods were designed and a unison group of dedicated salmon anglers took these rods to their hearts.<br /><br />Below links to the different ranges of Guideline six-piece fly rods, both double hand hand switch rods. <br /><br />Guideline NT8 DH 6-piece fly rods - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.guidelineflyfish.com/nt8/102928/nt8-6-6pc-double-hand-rods">https://www.guidelineflyfish.com/nt8/102928/nt8-6-6pc-double-hand-rods</a><br /><br />Guideline LPX Chrome DH 6-piece fly rods - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.guidelineflyfish.com/lpx-chrome/106473/lpx-chrome-6-pc-double-hand">https://www.guidelineflyfish.com/lpx-chrome/106473/lpx-chrome-6-pc-double-hand</a><br /><br />Guideline Elevation DH 6-piece fly rods - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.guidelineflyfish.com/elevation-t-pac/105830/elevation-t-pac-double-hand-rods">https://www.guidelineflyfish.com/elevation-t-pac/105830/elevation-t-pac-double-hand-rods</a><br /><br />Guideline Elevation SW 6-piece fly rods - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.guidelineflyfish.com/elevation-t-pac/105835/elevation-t-pac-switch-rods">https://www.guidelineflyfish.com/elevation-t-pac/105835/elevation-t-pac-switch-rods</a>{% endraw %}
