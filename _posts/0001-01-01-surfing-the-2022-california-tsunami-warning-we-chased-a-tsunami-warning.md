{% raw %}We chased a tsunami warning to the coast of California hoping to ride the wave that was put off, but our location didn't actually see any tsunami action, however other parts of California were actually affected by the tsunami. I saw footage from Santa Cruz &amp; other places where the wave actually pushed into the shoreline &amp; made land fall. It's a pretty scary situation, but the wave was only forecasted to be 1 foot in size, even so DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME. We had fun with the situation, but it's still a very serious situation &amp; should not be taken lightly. Thank you for the stoke &amp; support. - Ben<br /><br />Follow Us on Instagram:<br />@bengravyy<br />@jverni_<br /><br />Clothes &amp; Accessories:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wavebandit.com/collections/ben-gravy">https://www.wavebandit.com/collections/ben-gravy</a><br /><br />Wetsuits:                          <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hyperflexusa.com/categories/bengravy/">https://hyperflexusa.com/categories/bengravy/</a><br /><br />Soft Top Surfboards:      <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wavebandit.com/collections/ben-gravy">https://www.wavebandit.com/collections/ben-gravy</a><br /><br />CBD Aloha: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cbd-aloha.com/">https://cbd-aloha.com/</a><br /><br />Fiberglass Surfboards:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.superbranded.com/collections/ben-gravys-picks">https://www.superbranded.com/collections/ben-gravys-picks</a><br /><br />Skateboards:                  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sector9.com/blogs/surf/ben-graeff">https://www.sector9.com/blogs/surf/ben-graeff</a>{% endraw %}
