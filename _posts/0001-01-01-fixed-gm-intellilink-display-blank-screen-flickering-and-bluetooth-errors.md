{% raw %}If your intellilink display is starting to flicker, change channels or go to a blank screen, this might be a fix for you.  This might also fix a XM radio not working correctly. It may also help with iPhone or bluetooth  connections.  This truck is a 2016 GM truck.  After the fix, everything seems to be working like new.  If this helped you can you throw it a like and subscribe.  If it really helped, maybe you can hit the bell icon.  THIS WORKS ON GMC, Chevrolet, Sierra, Yukon, Suburban, Denali and Silverado trucks.  It might work on Acadias as well.{% endraw %}
