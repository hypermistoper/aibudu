{% raw %}Fidget Toy Tik Tok Satisfying Pop It #shorts<br />ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/MORY-Fidget-Toy">https://bit.ly/MORY-Fidget-Toy</a><br />What is a fidget toy?<br />A fidget is a small object (preferably one that fits in the childâ€™s hand), that can be squeezed, pulled, or moved around as a child is sitting and listening e.g. at group times, listening to a story or waiting for a turn during a small group game.<br />What are the reasons for using fidget toys?<br />Some people need to move in order to be able to concentrate, learn and be calm. Think about when you are in a meeting or a waiting room; there is often someone tapping their foot or clicking their pen up and down.<br />In an Early Childhood setting, children who fidget a lot and/or find it hard to sit still are often seeking extra sensory input that they cannot obtain from the environment. Some refer to this as a â€˜high thresholdâ€™ to neurological input, and as such, the more input that some children get, the more alert and organised their minds can be. The concept of fidget toys is based on the theory that some children are seeking things to touch and feel. They may be doing this to provide the â€˜just rightâ€™ amount of sensory input in order to calm their nervous system.<br />In a classroom or group situation, fidget toys are often used to provide sensory input in a minimally distracting way. They can help improve concentration and attention to tasks by allowing the brain to filter out the extra sensory information (e.g. paying attention to a book during a mat time). By having a fidget toy, a child may be able to better â€˜filter outâ€™ excess sensory information in their surroundings and their body, which is causing distraction. The fidget toy may encourage this sensory information to be focused on a toy in the hands. A fidget toy may also provide a distraction or stress release for a child who is anxious or feeling overwhelmed.<br /><br />â–º Thank You for watching!
