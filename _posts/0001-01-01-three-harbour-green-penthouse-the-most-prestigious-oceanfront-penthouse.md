{% raw %}The most prestigious and luxurious oceanfront penthouse in Canada is now listed! I’m humbled to represent this one-and-only Three Harbour Green Penthouse in Coal Harbour, Vancouver BC. <br /><br />Listed at $49 million, this stunning property spans the top three floors with nearly 13,000 square feet of combined living space, including four bedrooms, five bathrooms, and more than 4,700 square feet of functional outdoor space. <br /><br />The 20-foot ceilings give the interior space an open feel, which is augmented by the unobstructed 360-degree views of the ocean, North Shore Mountains, Stanley Park, Lions Gate Bridge, and English Bay from EVERY room. <br /><br />Custom designed by @Karin Bohn , founder and creative director of the award-winning House of Bohn design studio, the home’s finishings include luxury materials, millwork and custom furnishings that reflect and enhance the views beyond.{% endraw %}
