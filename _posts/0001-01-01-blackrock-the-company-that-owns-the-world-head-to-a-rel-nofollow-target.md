(Basically, they were bailing out corporations that had too much debt or needed to borrow money)<br />You guessed it, they went right back to BlackRock.<br />Even though again, the same corporations BlackRock was helping to bailing out, were the same corporations they owned some of the biggest stakes in<br /><br />And yet, despite all his considerable power, the general public has practically never heard of Larry Fink<br />With BlackRock barely coming into the public eye during the recent claims that they’re buying up single-family homes<br />That’s because Larry is smart - he’s intentionally kept it that way<br />He’s spent the last 33 years building BlackRock into the biggest asset manager in the world, with over $9 trillion dollars under their management<br />Today, BlackRock’s clients include the retirement accounts of average everyday people in the form of pension funds, they also have sovereign wealth funds as their clients, other central banks, college endowments, “Fortune 500 companies”, and millions of individual investors<br />They’re the one of the top shareholders of many of the biggest stocks like Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, and even other major banks like Wells Fargo and Chase<br /><br />This is BlackRock<br />What some call &quot;the most influential financial institution in the world,&quot;<br />The world's largest shadow bank,<br />And perhaps… the company that owns the world… <br />When Larry Fink was asked by Bloomberg if it’s true that he’s the most powerful man in finance - the man responsible for $9 trillion dollars tried to convince you otherwise - that “I don’t think of myself as powerful”<br />Is that true? Does BlackRock own the world? Well, it’s a little complicated<br />-----------------------<br />Juan Rios - Cabaña <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chll.to/3c57d08c">https://chll.to/3c57d08c</a><br />Misha, Jussi Halme - Lullaby <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chll.to/7a8c0040">https://chll.to/7a8c0040</a><br /><br />All materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
