{% raw %}To learn and to teach is inherent in Nature.  We learn, and many other species do likewise, from our parents and then, later, teach our own young.  But in humans, the teaching can be a deliberate choice, rather than something which occurs without aforethought.   When we deliberately choose to teach, we teach not only others, but ourselves.  It is a win-win of profound importance.  To teach IS to love.{% endraw %}
