{% raw %}13-year-old poet, Solli Raphael asks &quot;what kind of human are you, what kind am I?&quot; Solli's unique and emotive poetry aims to explore human action towards environmental sustainability. Embracing ideas to encourage less landfill waste and man-made pollution, Solli's poem hopes to bring people together on a &quot;We Can be More&quot; mini campaign in his 3-minute fight to save the world. At just 13 years old, home-schooled Solli Raphael won the 2017-18 National Australian Poetry Slam Championship title against an all-adult competition at the Sydney Opera House, holding the title for the youngest ever winner!  Solli thrives on challenges such as raising awareness for important social and global issues and considers himself a budding humanitarian &amp; an enthusiastic environmentalist. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
