{% raw %}Welcome to another Arsecast Extra, the Arsenal podcast, with myself and James from @gunnerblog.<br /><br />In this episode James and I enjoy the 2-0 win over Leicester at the Emirates on Sunday. We discuss the sublime performance from Martin Odegaard, as well as the midfield dominance of Thomas Partey, aided and abetted by another solid team performance and that rarest of things – an Arsenal penalty. We chat about the kind of football we’re playing, the progress we’re making, and the fun elements to our football, as well as the ability to control games from good positions. Then there are listener questions about set-pieces, protecting Bukayo Saka, Gabriel Martinelli’s attacking instincts, Ben White impressing but making people laugh, and lots more.<br /><br />Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.arseblog.com">https://www.arseblog.com</a> for daily blogs and opinion, expert columnists, podcasts and more.<br /><br />Visit Arsebiz to support fellow Gooners - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arsebiz.arseblog.com">https://arsebiz.arseblog.com</a><br /><br />Follow Arseblog:<br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/arseblog">https://www.instagram.com/arseblog</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/arseblog">https://www.twitter.com/arseblog</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thearseblog">https://www.facebook.com/thearseblog</a><br /><br />Find our podcast archives here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://p1r.es/Arsechives">https://p1r.es/Arsechives</a><br /><br />Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/arseblog">https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</a>{% endraw %}
