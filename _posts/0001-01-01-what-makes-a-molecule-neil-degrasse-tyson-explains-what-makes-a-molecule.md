{% raw %}What makes a molecule? On this explainer, Neil deGrasse Tyson and comic co-host Chuck Nice explore atoms versus molecules. What makes molecules behave the way they do?<br /><br />We dive into different molecules and the atoms that make them. Can you tell what a molecule does based on the atoms inside? Find out about water, sodium chloride, buckminsterfullerene, and other molecules. How many configurations of carbon are there? How much of the universe is made up of hydrogen and helium? We discuss silicon-based life and what elements on the periodic table are the most chemically active in the universe. Is there anything the universe can’t teach us?<br /><br />Get the NEW Cosmic Queries book (5/5 ⭐s on Amazon!): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3dYIEQF">https://amzn.to/3dYIEQF</a><br /><br />Support us on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio">https://www.patreon.com/startalkradio</a><br /><br />FOLLOW or SUBSCRIBE to StarTalk:<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/startalkradio">http://twitter.com/startalkradio</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk">https://www.facebook.com/StarTalk</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/startalk">https://www.instagram.com/startalk</a><br /><br />About StarTalk: <br />Science meets pop culture on StarTalk!
