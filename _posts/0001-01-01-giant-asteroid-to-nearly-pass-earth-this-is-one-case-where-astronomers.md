{% raw %}This is one case where astronomers say absolutely lookup. Face south in the night sky with some pretty strong binoculars or the telescope you got for Christmas. You should be able to see a phenomenon, a pretty darned giant asteroid as it skirts between the earth and the sun in what NASA calls a potentially hazardous asteroid. But that's because it comes razor close to the planet by 1.2 million miles.{% endraw %}
