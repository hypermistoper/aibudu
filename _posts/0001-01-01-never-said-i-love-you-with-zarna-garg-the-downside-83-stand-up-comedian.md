{% raw %}Stand-up comedian Zarna Garg gives tips on how to lie to your Uber driver and admits that she’s never said “I love you” to her husband. She also shares the downsides of growing up in India, being radicalized by Archie comics and bootleg episodes of Good Times, losing your mother at 14 and immediately having your father try to marry you off, running away and having to develop a sense of humor so her friends parents would want to house her, having a daughter who’s majoring in ceramics, how white people ruined yoga, and whether she should have gone with the arranged marriage. <br /><br />Follow Zarna at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/zarnagarg/">https://www.instagram.com/zarnagarg/</a><br /><br />Follow me on<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/gianmarcosoresi">http://www.twitter.com/gianmarcosoresi</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/gianmarcosoresi">http://www.instagram.com/gianmarcosoresi</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/gianmarcosoresi">http://www.facebook.com/gianmarcosoresi</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@gianmarcosoresi">https://www.tiktok.com/@gianmarcosoresi</a>{% endraw %}
