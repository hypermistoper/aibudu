{% raw %}SpaceX’s upcoming rocket called Starship Super Heavy formerly known as BFR, will no longer be made out of lightweight Carbon Composites, it’ll sweat a lot, and just MIGHT need a TON of WD-40. <br /><br />So we’ll take a look at all of Elon’s most recent claims about stainless steel actually being the best option and see if we come to the same conclusion.<br /><br />We’ll also take a look at some other rockets that are made of stainless steel and explain how SpaceX's use of this material is a little different as they’ll be using new manufacturing techniques and doing things that have never been attempted before.<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />This video in article version - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://everydayastronaut.com/stainless-steel-starship/">https://everydayastronaut.com/stainless-steel-starship/</a><br /><br />Amazing Starship renders and turn table animation by Reese Carges - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AstroReeseW">https://twitter.com/AstroReeseW</a><br /><br />Thanks to HazeGrayArt for letting me use his awesome Starship landing animation!!!
