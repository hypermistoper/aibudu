{% raw %}The Uncommon, a new desert cafe pop-up featuring a huge mirror that reflects the picturesque setting around you. The Instagrammable destination offers lounge seating surrounded by different mirrors, and coffee served in cute takeaway cups. The vibe is relaxed and peaceful, and makes a great spot for watching the sunset. It’s one hour’s drive from Dubai, by car take the E44 to E611 and head up E102 to Al Faya.{% endraw %}
