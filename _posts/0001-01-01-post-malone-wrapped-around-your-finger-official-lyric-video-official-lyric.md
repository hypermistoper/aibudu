Take me back to yesterday,<br />When I was wrapped around your finger, Wrapped around your finger,<br />Then was shot back down to Earth,<br />When we met you ain’t know I was a singer,<br />You weren’t impressed by all the ice on my fingers, I had your mom and daddy’s house on my pinky,<br />If I’da known what it’d be like now,<br />I wouldn’t be in misery right now, Look in the mirror I don’t see myself, Being with me has gotta be like hell,<br />So tell the devil I’ma be right down!<br />You keep me wrapped around your finger, Wrapped around your finger,<br />I was caught up in your orbit,<br />Spinning like a bullet,<br />I was wrapped around your finger, Wrapped around your finger, Then I shot back down to earth,<br />I keep wondering who’s the one replacing me? Take me back to yesterday,<br />When I was wrapped around your finger, Wrapped around your finger,<br />Then was shot back down to Earth,<br />Yeah I’m wrapped around, and around, and around on your finger now, You got me wrapped around, and around, and around on your finger now,<br />I’ma be right down!<br />You keep me wrapped around your finger, Wrapped around your finger,<br />I was caught up in your orbit,<br />Spinning like a bullet,<br />I was wrapped around your finger, Wrapped around your finger, Then I shot back down to earth,<br />I keep wondering who’s the one replacing me? Take me back to yesterday,<br />When I was wrapped around your finger, Wrapped around your finger,<br />Then was shot back down to Earth,<br /><br />#PostMalone #TwelveCaratToothache #WrappedAroundYourFinger<br /><br />Music video by Post Malone performing Wrapped Around Your Finger (Lyric Video). © 2022 Mercury Records/Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vevo.ly/Ve2bHp">http://vevo.ly/Ve2bHp</a>{% endraw %}
