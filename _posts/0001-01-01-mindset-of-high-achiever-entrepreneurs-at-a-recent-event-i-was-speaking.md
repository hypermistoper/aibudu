{% raw %}At a recent event I was speaking at, somebody asked why they don’t they accomplish the things they want￼. This made me think of my eight-year-old because of a recent statement he made that almost  every father wants to hear in their lifetime￼. <br /><br />What do you think is the difference between saying will vs want￼? Comment below as I would like to hear your thoughts.
