{% raw %}This month marks the 25th anniversary of the Heaven's Gate mass suicide. Thirty-nine members of the bizarre cult led by Marshall Applewhite all took their own lives, making it one of the largest mass suicides in U.S. history. Survivor Jana Gibbons was a vulnerable 16-year-old girl when she moved into the mansion. Newly released home video shows inside the cult, where every minute was controlled, including when and how they slept, how long they showered and rules about not talking.{% endraw %}
