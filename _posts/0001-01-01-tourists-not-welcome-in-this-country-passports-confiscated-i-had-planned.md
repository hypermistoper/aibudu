{% raw %}I had planned a trip to Bangladesh with @Go With Ali and @Dany #gotaworldtosee but we found ourselves in a sticky situation when we arrived into the country.<br /><br />To make this situation better please donate to the charity we were planning to work with who are helping people who need and deserve it:<br /><br />Launchgood.com/savingmankind <br /><br />Human Appeal will be providing Emergency Medical Surgeries to some of the poorest people around the world, without your support they cannot survive.  <br /><br />Ikhlas was born and lives in Somalia. She suffers from Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpurawhich is a blood disorder characterized by an abnormal decrease in the number of platelets in the blood. She lives with her aunt that takes her to the hospital on a weekly-basis for a blood transfusion.  <br /><br />The doctors in Somalia have said they are not able to provide the treatment she needs to help save her life and the only solution is for Ikhlas to travel abroad.<br /><br />Ikhlas's family cannot afford to pay the weekly blood transfusions needed and these transfusions do not provide a long-term solution.<br /><br />As a result of her condition, she is unable to play with her friends as she gets injured easily and loses a lot of blood. Due to this fear and worry of severe injury, Ikhlas's aunt Qaali does not let her out of her sight.<br /><br />Without this treatment, her life is severely limited and her chances of survival are slim.<br /><br />FOLLOW ME: <br />❇️ Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/harryjaggard/">https://www.instagram.com/harryjaggard/</a><br />❇️ Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/harryjaggard2">https://www.facebook.com/harryjaggard2</a><br />❇️ Email - contact@harryjaggard.com (business enquiries only please)<br />❇️ Support my channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/harryjaggard">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/harryjaggard</a><br />❇️ Support my channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/harryjaggard">https://www.patreon.com/harryjaggard</a><br /><br />Affiliate links:<br />My Credit Card: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amex.co.uk/refer/hARRYJJhou?CPID=100402696">http://amex.co.uk/refer/hARRYJJhou?CPID=100402696</a><br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />#bangladesh #dhaka #bangladeshvlog{% endraw %}
