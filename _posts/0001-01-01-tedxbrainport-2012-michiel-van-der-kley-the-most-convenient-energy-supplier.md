{% raw %}TEDxBrainport 2012 - Making the Future<br /><br />How does a furniture designer become an energy producer? Michiel van der started out making furniture that looked good. He then wondered if he could also make it functional, so he designed a workstation. But he stil wanted more, he wanted to design something that was also meaningful. Working with TNO he created a workstation that not only looks good, but also allows users to power their own devices. It brings together energy and activity, letting you work and exercise at the same time.<br /><br />About Michiel van der Kley<br />Michiel van der Kley [1962, the Hague] designs furniture. His designs are being produced by furniture companies in Holland and abroad, like Artifort, Arco, van Esch and Softline.
