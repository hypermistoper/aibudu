{% raw %}▶ C'mon over to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://realpars.com">https://realpars.com</a> where you can learn PLC programming faster and easier than you ever thought possible!<br /><br />=============================<br /><br />▶ Check out the full blog post over at<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://realpars.com/safety-plc">https://realpars.com/safety-plc</a><br /><br />=============================<br /><br />In this video, we’re going to talk about a very important part of any automated industrial process the Safety PLC.<br /><br />A Safety PLC is one of the 3 parts of a Safety Instrumented System (SIS). The SIS can also be referred to as the Safety Shutdown System.<br /><br />Stated simply, the SIS monitors the equipment or process and if an unacceptable condition or risk, or an unsafe condition occurs it reacts by the shutdown of the equipment or process.<br /><br />Safety PLCs are constantly guarding against plant failures which could result in harm to people, equipment, or the environment. When specified hazardous conditions occur, the Safety PLC will respond by placing the plant in a safe condition.<br /><br />The Safety PLC is referred to as the Logic Solver in the Safety Instrumented System.<br /><br />Safety shutdown systems are not new. Before the introduction of Safety PLCs, plant shutdown conditions were monitored and operated by typical field devices and instruments and the logic was performed by hardwired relays. Gone are the days of hard-wired relay logic in both Process and Safety PLCs.<br /><br />A Safety PLC is just like a regular PLC and is programmed the same way.<br />The logic in the Safety PLC is locked. It has safety signatures ensuring that coding has not been changed.<br /><br />Physically, other than they might be a different color, they look exactly the same! But…that’s where the similarity ends.<br /><br />Safety PLC has extra features like redundancy and added hardware functionality that adheres to a specific Safety Integrity Level (or SIL).<br /><br />The Safety PLC can perform additional field device checking such as snooping for broken wires, failed contacts, among other features.<br /><br />The Safety PLC has the multi-channel capability for redundant I/O monitor and operation capability.<br /><br />=============================<br /><br />You might want to review 2 of our other articles:<br /><br />1) What is a Safety Instrumented System?
