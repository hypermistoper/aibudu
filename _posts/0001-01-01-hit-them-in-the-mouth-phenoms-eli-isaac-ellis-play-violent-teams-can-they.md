We got Eli and Isaac back again this week but first they gotta take care of business against Combine. Combine really thought they were just gonna walk in and take the W against Moravian, but the Ellis Bros had different plans. Everyone on Moravian Prep had themselves a GAME and they copped the win against Combine and THEY MOVED UP TO #1 IN THE STATE!!! Their postgame celebration was so hype I wish I was there fr. <br /><br />After that, we checked out the Team House before traveling with the boys to the Outer Banks for some more games. They took the easy dub against Greenfield and put up 109 on them 😳 They legit won by 50 it was insane.<br /><br />Then we gotta see if the boys can keep their undefeated record and #1 ranking alive vs Word of God. They got some insane commits and they legit all look like grown men playing on a high school basketball team. Y'all think Eli and Isaac can take them tho? <br /><br />Love y'all hope you guys are enjoying the show<br />---------------------------------<br />Follow Us...
