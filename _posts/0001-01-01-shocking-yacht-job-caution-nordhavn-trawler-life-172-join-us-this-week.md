{% raw %}Join us this week on Aboard Mermaid Monster as we install all new batteries for the boat. WOW! What a pain in the butt job it was. It is SO much work. These batteries each way around 150lbs and there were 14 of them to change out. We also installed our Lippert hatches. Thanks Lippert for giving us all new hatches. Our boat is looking dynamite right now. There is a lot of prep work that goes in to getting ready to push off the dock. We are nearly there though and boy do we have some fun adventures heading your way. All the good kinds. If you are new here then welcome. Please join us every Sunday morning at 9am ET for a brand new episode posted every single week. We are full time cruisers that have been doing this for 4 years on our Nordhavn 55 trawler. Enjoy. <br /><br />Music epidemic sound<br />Lost in your paradise <br />Hangman <br />Funny walks aside <br />Flowers at the market <br /><br />Thank you to Vineyard Vines, Highfield Tenders, Mantus Marine and Seakits for being collaborative partners!<br /><br />Thanks to Lippert.
