{% raw %}Welcome or welcome back to Twisted Minds. My name is James, and today we will be looking at the case of Carroll Edward Cole. <br /><br />The case of Caroll Edward Cole is as controversial as they come, because while many believe he got what was coming to him when his sentence was passed, others believe that since he sought help from mental institutions to curb his murderous tendencies all to no avail, the institutions and doctors involved should also be brought to book. <br /><br />In today's video, you will learn all there is to know about Carroll Edward Cole. Before we get into the video, bear in mind that this is a tale that sees mummy issues and childhood trauma culminate into a string of heinous crimes that would leave even the world's most feared serial killers with their jaws hanging up.{% endraw %}
