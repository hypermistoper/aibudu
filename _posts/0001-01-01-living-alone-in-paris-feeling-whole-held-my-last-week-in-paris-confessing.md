{% raw %}My last week in Paris, confessing my absolute love for this city and Europe in general, feeling so motivated to plan a full move abroad for a year or more... Finding sweet sounds everywhere I go has given me so much confidence to root myself where I plant my feet, and I couldn't be more thrilled with where this season has brought me. I went through a lot at the beginning of the year (fully off camera) and felt like I was in a death cycle for the first three months of the year, needless to say I am happy that I honored that time fully to have arrived here.<br /><br />Also I've been logging a lot which usually isn't the bulk of my content but I have a few more to go before returning with some more videos on emotional intelligence, recipes, and spiritual advice. Thank you for being kind!<br /><br />- MY SOCIAL MEDIA -   <br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/yaknowme_hitomi/">https://www.instagram.com/yaknowme_hitomi/</a><br />TIK TOK: yaknowme_hitomi222<br />Spotify: thejauntforckandhm<br /><br />- CHAPTERS-<br />0:00-0:26 hellloo<br />0:26-2:20 journal entry <br />2:20-3:16 open mic poetry night<br />3:16-3:55 morning routine<br />3:55-4:46 on grounded spontaneity &amp; romanticization<br />4:46-12:05 Went to my first rave!<br />12:05-14:11 lit up from inside<br />14:11-14:41 feeling femme ootd<br />14:41-16:42 a lovely park day<br />16:42-18:32 saying goodbye to the sweetest city{% endraw %}
