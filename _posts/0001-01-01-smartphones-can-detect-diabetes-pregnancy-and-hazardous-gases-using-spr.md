{% raw %}Researchers at the  University of Hanover, Germany, have developed a self-contained fiber optic sensor for smartphones with the potential for use in a wide variety of biomolecular tests, including those for detecting pregnancy or monitoring diabetes. The readings of the sensor can run through an application on a smartphone which provide real-time results. When properly provisioned, the smartphone-user has the ability to monitor multiple types of body fluids, including: blood, urine, saliva, sweat or breath. In case of medical applications, the sensor readings can be combined with the GPS signal of a smartphone and users can then be guided to the next drug store, hospital or the ambulance.<br />The sensor uses the optical phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) to detect the composition of a liquid or the presence of particular biomolecules or trace gases.<br />Surface plasmon resonance occurs when a fixed beam of light strikes a metallic film; most of the light is reflected, but a small band is absorbed by the film's surface electrons, causing them to resonate. <br />Surface plasmon resonance is a phenomenon commonly used for biosensing, but typically requires bulky lab equipment involving both a light detector and light source. Fortunately, smartphones already have both of these, allowing the minimalist, U-shaped device the researchers designed to consist solely of a 400-micrometer diameter core multimode fiber with a silver-coated sensing region.  <br /><br />Read more details at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2015/could_your_smartphone_one_day_tell_you_you_re_preg/">http://www.osa.org/en-us/about_osa/newsroom/news_releases/2015/could_your_smartphone_one_day_tell_you_you_re_preg/</a><br /><br />Images Credit: OSA{% endraw %}
