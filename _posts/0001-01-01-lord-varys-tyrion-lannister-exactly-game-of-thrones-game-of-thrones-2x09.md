{% raw %}Game of Thrones, Game of Thrones 2x09 - Blackwater, Game of Thrones  Lord Varys (Conleth Hill) Tyrion Lannister (Peter Dinklage) <br /><br />I've always hated the bells. They ring for horror a dead king, a city under siege. - A wedding.   Exactly. Podrick, is that it? &quot;Is that it?&quot; Nice touch. As if you don't know the name of every boy in town. I'm not entirely sure what you're suggesting. I'm entirely sure you're entirely sure what I'm suggesting. Do you trust him? Oddly enough, I do. Good. The map you asked for. There must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city. Closer to 50. The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary. I'm not escaping. Strange as it sounds, I'm the captain of the ship. And if the ship goes down, I go with her. That is good to hear. Though I'm sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat. You look well suited for battle, My Lord. Well, I'm not. For all our sakes, I hope you are wrong. My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a Red Priestess from Asshai. What of it? You don't believe in the old powers, My Lord? Blood spells, curses, shape-shifting what do you think? I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen. You probably don't entirely trust me. Mm, don't take it personally. I don't entirely trust myself. And yet I have seen things and heard things things you have not, things I wish I had not. I don't believe I've ever told you how I was cut. No, I don't believe you have. One day I will. The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door. For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne, I can think of nothing worse. And tonight, I believe you are the only man who can stop him.{% endraw %}
