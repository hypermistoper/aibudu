{% raw %}Lyrics :<br /><br />Every night before I go to sleep<br /> Find a ticket, win a lottery,<br /> Scoop the pearls up from the sea<br /> Cash them in and buy you all the things you need. <br /><br /> Every night before I rest my head<br /> See those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed.<br /> I know they're stolen, but I don't feel bad.<br /> I take that money, buy you things you never had. <br /><br /> Oh, baby, it would mean so much to me,<br /> Oh, baby, to buy you all the things you need for free.<br /> I'll buy you a jet plane, baby,<br /> Get you on a higher plane to a jet stream<br /> And take you through the stratosphere<br /> And check out the planets there and then take you down<br /> Deep where it's hot, hot in Arabia, babia, then cool, cold fields of snow<br /> And we'll roll, dream, roll, dream, roll, roll, dream, dream.<br /> When we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it,<br /> We'll dream it, dream it for free, free money,<br /> Free money, free money, free money, free money, free money, free money. <br /><br /> Every night before I go to sleep<br /> Find a ticket, win a lottery.<br /> Every night before I rest my head<br /> See those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed. <br /><br /> Oh, baby, it would mean so much to me,<br /> Baby, I know our troubles will be gone.<br /> Oh, I know our troubles will be gone, goin' gone<br /> If we dream, dream, dream for free.<br /> And when we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it,<br /> Let's dream it, we'll dream it for free, free money,<br /> Free money, free money, free money, X7<br /> Free money, free money, free money, free.{% endraw %}
