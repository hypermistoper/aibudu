{% raw %}Squelch Squad! Welcome back to another episode! This week we do some urban exploration... Watch as we walk through the Tower of Grain - an incredible abandoned Fort/Gun tower. Situated 500m out from the shoreline, this tower was created in the mid 1800's to protect the surrounding docks of Sheerness and Chatham. It became disused in 1956 and has stood here eerily ever since...<br />We really hope you enjoy this squelchy adventure, drop a comment and let us know what you'd like to see more of in future videos!
