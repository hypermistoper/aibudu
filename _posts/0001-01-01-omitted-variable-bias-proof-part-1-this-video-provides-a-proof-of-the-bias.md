{% raw %}This video provides a proof of the bias of estimators, if an important variable (which is correlated with the existing regressors, is omitted from the regression). Check out <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ben-lambert.com/econometrics-course-problem-sets-and-data/">https://ben-lambert.com/econometrics-course-problem-sets-and-data/</a> for course materials, and information regarding updates on each of the courses. Quite excitingly (for me at least), I am about to publish a whole series of new videos on Bayesian statistics on youtube. See here for information: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ben-lambert.com/bayesian/">https://ben-lambert.com/bayesian/</a> Accompanying this series, there will be a book: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1473916364/ref=pe_3140701_247401851_em_1p_0_ti">https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1473916364/ref=pe_3140701_247401851_em_1p_0_ti</a>{% endraw %}
