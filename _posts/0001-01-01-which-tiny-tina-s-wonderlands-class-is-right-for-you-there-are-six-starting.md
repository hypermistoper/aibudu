{% raw %}There are six starting character classes in Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, and whether you want to be a hammer swinging fire god or a badass dual wielding gun wizard, or you just can’t decide what you want to be, we have you covered.<br /><br />00:14 - Spore Warden<br />03:23 - Spellshot<br />06:36 - Brr-Zerker<br />11:06 - Clawbringer<br />15:01 - Graveborn<br />21:30 - Stabbomancer<br /><br />Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands departs from the core Borderlands series and allows you to make your own character. Instead of a vault hunter, you’ll play as a highly customizable Fatemaker. When it comes to how you’ll fight, you get to choose one of six starting classes: Brr-Zerker, Clawbringer, Graveborn, Spellshot, Spore Warde, or Stabbomancer. Later in the game, you can multiclass and build your hero using a second skill tree from another class. That means you’ll be able to come up with some pretty wild and powerful builds with the ability to do things like bring multiple pets with you into battle.<br /><br />It can be pretty daunting trying to decide on a starting class, so in this video, we’re going to give you a rundown of each and to help you figure out which one is right for you. There are easy solo classes like the Stabbomancer, which focuses on critical damage and can go invisible to escape bad situations. There are team-player classes like the Clawbringer, which can buff the party with fire damage while running around smashing things with a hammer. For original Borderlands fans who love Salvador the Gunzerker, you have something similar in the Spellshot, which can dual-wield magic. Druid/ranger types will love the ranged class Spore Warden. Glass cannon types will appreciate the Graveborn, and Krieg fans will enjoy running into and smashing things with the Brr-Zerker. <br /><br />Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands releases on March 25 for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S, although you need to purchase the more expensive editions of the game for new-gen optimizations. Its first post-launch content season begins starting April 21 and developer Gearbox has said it'll add a seventh class at a later point.<br /><br />#tinytinaswonderlands{% endraw %}
