After living near the city our entire lives we finally decided to sell it all, pack up our 3 kids and live in an RV on our 73 acres while building our own debt free, off-grid house and learning to live a more self-reliant life.<br />Our house build is documented entirely on our main channel &quot;Wild Wonderful Off-Grid&quot; and our family life vlogs can be found on our secondary channel &quot;Wild Wonderful After Show&quot;{% endraw %}
