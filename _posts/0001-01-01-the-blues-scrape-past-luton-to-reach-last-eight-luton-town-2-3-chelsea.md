{% raw %}Luton Town took the lead early on just two minutes into the first half with a Reece Burke headed goal from a corner kick put the hosts in the lead, Chelsea’s Saul Niguez scores his first goal for the blues with a well-taken finish to level the game. Harry Cornick pounced on  Malang Sarr's lack of concentration to put Luton Town in the lead just before the break. Timo Werner's cool finish from a lofted pass from Ruben Loftus Cheek and a well taken Romelu Lukaku’s finish spares Chelsea's blushes and sends the blues to the quarter-finals of the Emirates FA Cup.<br /><br />Follow @EmiratesFACup on Twitter for in-game highlights and match updates!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/emiratesfacup">https://twitter.com/emiratesfacup</a><br /><br />Subscribe:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/thefacup">https://www.youtube.com/thefacup</a><br /><br />To find out more about The Emirates FA Cup visit:<br />TheFA.com/EmiratesFACup<br /><br />The Emirates FA Cup on Facebook<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/TheFACup">http://www.facebook.com/TheFACup</a>{% endraw %}
