{% raw %}In statistics, variance measures the deviation from the mean. To calculate the variance, the sum of the squared variances is divided by the number of values.<br /><br />Variance<br />The variance now describes the squared average distance from the mean. Because the values are squared, the result has a different unit (just the unit squared) than the original values. Therefore, it is difficult to relate the results.<br /><br />Difference between variance and standard deviation<br />So, the difference between the variance and standard deviation dispersion parameter is that the standard deviation measures the average distance from the mean and the variance measures the squared average distance from the mean. Put another way, the variance is the squared standard deviation and the standard deviation is the root of the variance.<br /><br />Variance Calculator:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://datatab.net/statistics-calculator/descriptive-statistics/standard-deviation-and-variance-calculator">https://datatab.net/statistics-calculator/descriptive-statistics/standard-deviation-and-variance-calculator</a><br /><br />More information on variance:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://datatab.net/tutorial/dispersion-parameter">https://datatab.net/tutorial/dispersion-parameter</a>{% endraw %}
