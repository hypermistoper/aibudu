{% raw %}🔥SHOP NOW!!🔥━► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.teamrar.com/">https://www.teamrar.com/</a> <br /><br />I just got married in Vegas (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/_Qf7MeZEnFg)">https://youtu.be/_Qf7MeZEnFg)</a> But how do you top off getting married? Going to space! That's right, we put our money where our mouth is this time and actually became the FIRST YouTubers to launch merch into space. And to do that, we teamed up with the awesome guys at @sentintospace. Sent Into Space helped us launch our first-ever Team RAR astronaut over 300,000 feet (91,440 m) into space--and it almost didn't happen because Carter Sharer kept inhaling all the helium. Then Andrew showed up to investigate and started breathing the helium with Carer Sharer as well!! We were sure @Hunter Kowald was going to be the first Team RAR astronaut, but it turns out that drones can't carry you to space... yet! What should we launch into space next? Comment below!!<br /><br />Thanks again to everyone at @sentintospace for helping us create the first-ever Team RAR astronaut!!
