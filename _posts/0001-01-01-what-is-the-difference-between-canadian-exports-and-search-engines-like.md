{% raw %}Often times we get asked how we are different from search engines (like Google) and from local advertising<br /><br />First, Google is great and we are not even TRYING to compete with it; we love Google and use it all the time<br />The thing is that when someone out there uses a search engine to look for a Canadian product or service like yours, do you know how many thousands of search results he will get? Try Google your own product or service and see for yourself<br />Moreover, Google does not tell you who is who; it lists everything and everybody<br /><br />Talking about the local advertising, it is simply too expensive<br /><br />Well, we are not a search engine, but an “Export-Promotion Tool”: all our members are exporters and all our visitors are potential importers, buyers, and distributors looking for YOUR products or services<br /><br />We are trusted worldwide because we check the Canadian exporters before listing them with us, so you know you are dealing with a GOOD business partner<br /><br />See our website and other videos for detailed services we offer to the Canadian exporter, and to the international importer<br /><br />Canadian Exports, Bringing Canadian exporters and international importers together<br /><br />For more info, visit us at: www.canadianexports.org{% endraw %}
