{% raw %}A peer reviewed scientific paper published online yesterday (Monday March 14th) showed that extremely large sinkholes have appeared on the seafloor at the margin of the continental shelf in the Canadian Arctic (Beaufort Sea) within the last 10 years, and they were not created by Putin’s Russian bombs. In fact abrupt climate system change is much more powerfully changing the face of our planet, on both land and sea, than any military force can do, with the exception of nuclear weapons. <br /><br />A detailed study in Canada’s Arctic involved an extensive bathymetric survey using side-scan sonar and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) on 4 different expeditions between 2010 and 2019. Over this period of time, massive sinkholes large enough to swallow and entire city block of 6 story buildings have formed on the seafloor between 120 meters depth and 150 meters depth, as well as ice filled hills (lingo like features). <br /><br />We have seen lots of these types of structures in the Arctic on land, due to temperatures increasing in the Arctic 4 to 5 times faster that the global average. There is no reason not to expect these changes on the sea floor, and now, for the first time, this has been documented in a detailed peer reviewed scientific paper to be precisely happening. <br /><br />I discuss the top-down picture of what is happening in the Arctic, as well as the detailed findings in the scientific paper, and what it means to us. <br /><br />In the paleo records, there were rapid outbursts of methane from the ocean floor, and huge pick marks on the sea floor off New Zealand have been observed, as I reported in a video a while ago on methane. Perhaps we are seeing beginning signs that this may happen again do our anthropogenic abrupt climate system change disruptions.<br /><br />Please donate to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://paulbeckwith.net">http://paulbeckwith.net</a> to support my research and videos as I connect the dots on our ongoing and accelerating abrupt climate system change.
