{% raw %}My apologies for the late upload. I have so much going on in my phone I was unable to upload.<br />Still this upload is not of the same audio &amp; visual quality I'm use to presenting.<br /><br />UNFORTUNATELY, after reviewing while editing.... all parts of BBD, JG' s - &quot;My, My, My&quot; &amp;  B. Brown's &quot;Every Little Step&quot;... the music sounds HORRIBLE.  I believe the music was turned up during those songs. So I apologize!!<br /><br />I Only edited so much and wasn't going to post this since it's not up to my likings but ones have asked for the upload so excuse and please enjoy what you can.<br /><br />Miami, Florida April 10, 2022<br /><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I do not own the rights to this music.
