{% raw %}Seven months ago i uploaded a video titles &quot;I started ADHD medication at 19&quot; and it got a lot fo attention. Since then I've noticed there aren't a lot of other videos out there (that I could find) about people starting adhd medication from the same 'vlog' or 'come with me throughout the process' style.... which surprised me. <br />part one link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/L4LevmvlUo8">https://youtu.be/L4LevmvlUo8</a> <br /><br />I got a lot of amazing comments on this video thanking me for sharing and how reliving it was to hear about someone going through a similar experience, so Im very glad to have been a calming help to some people.<br /><br />I also got a lot of questions and requests for an update, so here's that! I do upload weekly-ish, buy I don't always get into the specifics about my adhd because... well it's not my whole personality and I don't always need to talk about it. But getting diagnosed and dealing with it has been a huge help (fi not like the reason why) I am doing well, sooo i figured I would finally give and update and answer some questions (and respond to some mean comments lol) <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Time keys: <br />00:00 - Intro <br />1:55 - Backstory<br />5:05 - Not a doctor <br />6:25 - How I got Diagnosed <br />9:05 - What Meds I take <br />10:27 - Why I take meds <br />12:42 - Hate comment time <br />13:05 - 'ADHD is fAkE' <br />13:47 - mean comment pt 2 <br />18:24 - Does it help with school <br />19:14 - Update &amp; outro <br /><br /><br /><br />For any business inquires (or if you want to say hi or whatever idc): hellosophiemarlo@gmail.com <br /><br />About me &amp; Socials if you care <br />       Instagram -- SophieMarlo <br />       TikTok -- Chickiberger  <br /><br />Music is not mine; it belongs to the following artists:<br />From Thematic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://app.hellothematic.com">https://app.hellothematic.com</a><br />Music by sunshine blvd. - Ocean Blue - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thmatc.co/?l=B5D18204">https://thmatc.co/?l=B5D18204</a><br />and youtube audio studio <br /><br /><br />Thank you for the support.
