{% raw %}I love getting questions in my DMs but sadly I can't answer them all especially if it's questions that keep on being repeated. One of the most frequent is from people who are a little unsure whether they want to splash out on a dedicated trials bike and want to know if a dirt jump bike would work instead.<br /><br />So let's find out!<br /><br />The Cute Thief collected a host of DJ and street trials parts and a suitable frame. For a change I decided to make it stand out a little more with a home spray job and I'm so pleased with the results!<br /><br />I don't yet find out how capable it is for trials but better believe I've got a serious test for it coming up soon!<br /><br />What do you think?<br /><br />See you next week!<br /><br />Patreon <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/aliclarkson">https://www.patreon.com/aliclarkson</a><br /><br />Instagram @aliclarkson<br /><br />Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aliclarkson.com/">https://aliclarkson.com/</a><br /><br />Paypal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/AliClarksonGB?locale.x=en_GB">https://paypal.me/AliClarksonGB?locale.x=en_GB</a><br /><br />Sponsors: Inspired Bicycles <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.inspiredbicycles.com/">https://www.inspiredbicycles.com/</a> <br />Tartybikes tartybikes.com/ <br />Ride Concepts Shoes <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rideconcepts.com/">https://rideconcepts.com/</a> <br />Light Bicycle Carbon Rims https:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/lightbicycle_ac">https://bit.ly/lightbicycle_ac</a> <br />Industry Nine <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://industrynine.com/">https://industrynine.com/</a> <br />ODI grips <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://odigrips.com/">https://odigrips.com/</a> <br />Rimpacts Tyre Inserts <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rimpactmtb.com/">https://www.rimpactmtb.com/</a> <br />MIX Hydration <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mxitup.com/">https://mxitup.com/</a> <br />HKT frame protection and mudguard <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hktproducts.co.uk/collections/hkt-ali-clarkson-collab">https://www.hktproducts.co.uk/collections/hkt-ali-clarkson-collab</a><br /><br />#dirtjump #bikebuild #aliclarkson #mtb{% endraw %}
