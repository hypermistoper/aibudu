{% raw %}Tom Kristensen might just know what he's doing in a racing car. We think the nine Le Mans victories prove that quite well. But after his retirement it's still clear that every now and then he is quite happy to prove just how good he really is behind the wheel of something ferocious. <br /><br />Take, for example, this Ford GT40, which he raced alongside Sam Hancock in the Gurney Cup at the 79th Goodwood Members' Meeting in 2021. After a good qualifying an incident in the race sent TK back to 18th for the restart after the Safety Car was brought out for three laps. Sad for him, but great for us, as we get to see him carve his way through the field into contention at the head in just a handful of tours. The BTCC race winner was in no mood to be held up and dispatched sportscars and other GT40s on his way forwards. <br /><br />Please enjoy this snapshot of the fightback and listen to that sonorous V8 sing.<br /><br /><br />#78MM #GT40 #TomKristensen<br /><br />Official Website ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.goodwood.com/grr/">http://www.goodwood.com/grr/</a><br />Facebook ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/goodwoodrrc">http://www.facebook.com/goodwoodrrc</a><br />Instagram ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/goodwoodrrc/">http://www.instagram.com/goodwoodrrc/</a> <br />Twitter ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/goodwoodrrc">http://www.twitter.com/goodwoodrrc</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE for more racing cars, supercars, new car reviews, historic motorsport and Goodwood event coverage  ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/GoodwoodTV">http://bit.ly/GoodwoodTV</a><br /><br />Buy your Goodwood Event tickets ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/GWBuyTickets">http://bit.ly/GWBuyTickets</a>{% endraw %}
