Considering all the love out there for the series, I figured this would be a good show to give the Is It as Great as We Remember? treatment. So let's do it by going through the whole OG Ben 10 series, continuing with season 3. <br /><br />Support me on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/lowart">https://www.patreon.com/lowart</a><br />Watch livestreams on Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/thelowart">https://www.twitch.tv/thelowart</a><br />Follow me on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheLowestArt">https://twitter.com/TheLowestArt</a><br />Contact me: lowart.contact@gmail.com<br /><br />Link to Part 1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/CLNiMJg8FAM">https://youtu.be/CLNiMJg8FAM</a><br />Link to Part 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/FWLys0hPw0E">https://youtu.be/FWLys0hPw0E</a><br />Link to Part 3: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/g2L4kakhCiw">https://youtu.be/g2L4kakhCiw</a><br /><br />Background music (in order of use):<br />- Ben 10 Intro Instrumental<br />- Easy Sunday by Bad Snacks<br />- Cutscene from Ben 10 Alien Force DS<br />- Cave from Ben 10 Alien Force DS <br />- Shipyard from Ben 10 Alien Force DS<br />- Wildvine Boss Battle from Ben 10 Alien Force DS <br />- Techadon Boss Battle from Ben 10 Alien Force DS <br />- Warehouse from Ben 10 Alien Force DS{% endraw %}
