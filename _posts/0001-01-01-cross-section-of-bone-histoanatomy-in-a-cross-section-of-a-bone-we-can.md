{% raw %}In a cross section of a bone we can see two types of bone tissue: spongy bone and compact bone. Compact bone is the outer layer and the spongy bone forms the inner layer.<br />compact bone looks compact and the spongy bone looks like sponges. There are trabeculae in spongy bone which gives its sponge like appearance.<br /><br />The compact bone is made up of osteon. The osteon has blood vessels and bone cells, things vital for the survival of the bone.{% endraw %}
