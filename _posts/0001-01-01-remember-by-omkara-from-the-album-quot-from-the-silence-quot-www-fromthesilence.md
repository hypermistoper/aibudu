{% raw %}From the album &quot;From the Silence&quot; www.fromthesilence.com<br /><br /><br /><br />This life is... This life is... This life is a dream. This life is a dream. It'll be over in the blink of an eye. Remember who you are. Remember what you are. Whose life is this? Whose hands are these? Whose voice is this? What am I? This life is just a dream. It will be over in the blink of an eye. Remember who you are. Remember what you are. Remember who you are. Om Gan Ganapataye Namaha. This life is beautiful. This life is horrible. This life is wonderful. And this life is just a dream... A dream made of love. Remember who you are. Remember what you are. Remember who you are. Remember... You are before. Before these questions. Before an answer. Remember... You are before. Before everything...{% endraw %}
