{% raw %}The rumoured new Sophie Ellis-Bextor single. Written by Róisín Murphy, Cathy Dennis and Calvin Harris - produced by Calvin Harris. Taken from Sophie's new album 'Make A Scene' out in Russia April 18th, UK late May.<br /><br />Róisín Murphy originally co-wrote and recorded this track for her 2007 album 'Overpowered' but it never made the cut. The song was first recorded by Sophie in 2008 and posted on her MySpace, and has since been re-recorded and remixed for inclusion on 'Make A Scene'.{% endraw %}
