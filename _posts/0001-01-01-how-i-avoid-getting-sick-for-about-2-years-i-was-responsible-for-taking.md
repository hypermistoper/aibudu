{% raw %}For about 2 years, I was responsible for taking care of my disabled mother full-time.<br /><br />This meant I COULD NOT get sick without jeopardizing her health. There wasn't any way I could &quot;call in&quot; to work if I wasn't feeling well. <br /><br />(While yes, we could have hired a nurse, but they would likely not be familiar with my mother's case or be able to provide 24/7 care, which my mother needed. Home health can be a bit complicated.) <br /><br />Here are some things I did to prevent getting sick:<br /><br />1.) Sleep long and deep - this was not always possible for me, as I would have to wake up multiple times during the night to attend to my mom. However, whenever I got a chance to sleep even 5 hours uninterrupted, it made a BIG difference. <br />2.) Eat lots of ginger powder - ginger has been shown in scientific studies to reduce inflammation and help prevent infections, but anecdotally I've had a great experience with it as well. I highly recommend trying it to anyone that is able. <br />3.) Eat lots of raw garlic - similar to ginger, but it seems to be even more potent, particularly for respiratory infections. I recommend not eating this on an empty stomach. <br />4.) Gargle with salt water (and boil salt water and inhale vapors) - this seemed to prevent infection from settling in my upper respiratory system. <br />5.) Reduce stress - this may be one of the hardest ones, but our emotional state plays a big role in our physiological health. Take steps to pamper your mental health. <br /><br />I hope this helps! If it becomes an issue, I can link some studies, but they are already quite easy to find online for anybody looking. Additionally, I made this video with the intention of sharing what has worked for me anecdotally. Try it if you want, but if you are hesitant or skeptical, you don't have to! <br /><br />#shorts #hybridcalisthenics #immuneboost <br /><br />Legal Notice: Consult a physician if you are concerned before making any lifestyle change.
