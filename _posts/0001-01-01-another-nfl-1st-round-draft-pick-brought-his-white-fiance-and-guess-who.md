{% raw %}Kyle Hamilton’s girlfriend Reese Damm is going viral over a clip of her epic handshake with him at the NFL Draft. Reese was captured on camera “engaging in an epic handshake with her man after he was selected by the Baltimore Ravens with the 14th overall pick.” The epic handshake was obviously a result of Kyle getting drafted. She was excited for him.<br /><br />According to TPS;<br /><br />Some were impressed by Reese and Kyle’s choreography, as they applauded the couple for nailing their handshake during the important moment.<br /><br />However, there were also plenty of people on Twitter who were having NONE of the handshake. One Twitter user even went so far as to call it “cringy.” Harsh? Probably, but since when has Twitter been a kind, gentle place?<br /><br />When you do things like this, you’ve got to expect the haters to come at you.<br /><br />Hamilton will have no time for handshakes anymore because he will be expected to start immediately for Ravens.<br /><br />With the 14th overall selection in the 2022 NFL Draft, the Baltimore Ravens selected former Notre Dame All-American safety Kyle Hamilton. That pick ended the slide for 6-4, 220-pound Hamilton, who was largely projected to go somewhere in the top ten but suffered a bit of a slide.<br /><br />It can, however, be argued that that slide put the former Irish great into about as good a situation as you can hope for – for the most part. With the rookie pay scale, the way it is now, the drop-off from pick No. 10 to No. 14 isn’t as much as you may imagine either. According to Spotrac, the difference is right around four million dollars total on the initial contract, which may sound like a lot but for the NFL, it’s a very small difference.<br /><br />The Baltimore Ravens traditionally were about as smart of a decision-making team under former General Manager Ozzie Newsome. They made a living off of not doing too much, and letting good football players fall to them. That continues under new General Manager Eric DeCosta. The value to grab Hamilton at that slot is tremendous.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blacksportsonline.com/2022/04/watch-kyle-hamilton-girlfriend-reese-damm-go-viral-over-their-epic-handshake-at-the-nfl-draft/">https://blacksportsonline.com/2022/04/watch-kyle-hamilton-girlfriend-reese-damm-go-viral-over-their-epic-handshake-at-the-nfl-draft/</a>{% endraw %}
