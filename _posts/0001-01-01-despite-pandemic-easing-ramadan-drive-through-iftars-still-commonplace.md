{% raw %}During Ramadan, communal iftars, or breaking of fasts for Muslims in mosques, are the norm in the United States, but since the coronavirus pandemic began, drive-thru food distributions have become popular. VOA's Faiza Bukhari takes us behind the scenes at one of Virginia's Islamic centers, where a daily drive-thru iftar for roughly 800 people is organized.<br /><br />Dar Alnoor Islamic Community Center in Manassas, Virginia, hosts a daily drive-thru iftar for about 800 fasting Muslims.<br /><br />Preparing meals for that many hungry worshipers demands the participation of a group of volunteers who dedicate their time and energy to assisting those in need.<br /><br />Ayaz Sheikh, Volunteer Cook:<br /><br />“We work as volunteers for the whole month of Ramadan, while maintaining our full-time jobs. This is our third year here.”<br /><br />Each day's menu is different.<br /><br />Huma Sheikh, Volunteer Cook:<br /><br />“Some days we have Biryani, some days chickpeas, samosas, fritters, or chicken curry. One person is providing raw chicken for the whole month, other have donated spices, rice and chickpeas.”<br /><br />Local school students volunteer to assist with boxing the meals once they are prepared.<br /><br />Student volunteers say that helping not only earns them academic credits, but it also brings them joy.<br /><br />Ishan Aryan, Volunteer:<br /><br />“We have this opportunity to volunteer at this masjid to get our service hours up in hopes to graduate but in return we're also doing this from the greatness of our hearts.”<br /><br />Samira Iddrisu, Volunteer:<br /><br />“You can get more blessings in doing it and I got to know because I live close by, and I usually come to pray here.”<br /><br />Adam Haq, Volunteer:<br /><br />“The feeling that you get when you make someone's day is amazing.”<br /><br />Breaking fast together during Ramadan, according to other volunteers, is the traditional approach.<br /><br />Fauzia Ahmed, Volunteer:<br /><br />“Sharing food and eating together is an Islamic way.”<br /><br />Organizers of the drive-thru iftar say pandemic has been the reason for distributing food like this.<br /><br />Rafi Uddin Ahmed, President, Muslim Association of Virginia:<br /><br />“When Covid-19 started, we used to deliver food at people’s houses, but not anymore, because now demand for drive-thru has increased. But if a disabled person contacts us that they need food but don’t have a ride, we will accommodate them.”<br /><br />Hundreds of Muslims from all walks of life receive iftar meals every day at this Islamic center, which is sponsored by public donations and sponsors.<br /><br />Originally published at - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.voanews.com/a/despite-pandemic-easing-ramadan-drive-through-iftars-still-commonplace-in-us/6543124.html">https://www.voanews.com/a/despite-pandemic-easing-ramadan-drive-through-iftars-still-commonplace-in-us/6543124.html</a><br /><br />» Subscribe to VOA News: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3KIPysi">https://bit.ly/3KIPysi</a><br />» Watch more VOA News video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/VOANews">https://www.youtube.com/c/VOANews</a><br /><br />Voice of America (VOA) is the largest U.S. international broadcaster, providing news and information in more than 40 languages to an estimated weekly audience of 236.8 million people.
