{% raw %}If we wanted to grow as much food as possible, it would make sense to grow a lot of the higher yielding plants, but what crops are the most productive.<br /><br />Help me develop these gardens and make more videos through regular contributions <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/redgardens">https://www.patreon.com/redgardens</a><br /><br />Or use <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/redgardens">https://www.paypal.me/redgardens</a> as a simple, once-off way to support this project and the time and energy that goes into making videos.
