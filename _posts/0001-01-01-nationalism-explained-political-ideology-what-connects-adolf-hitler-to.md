{% raw %}What connects Adolf Hitler to Margaret Thatcher and Ho Chi Minh to Ronald Reagan? They were all nationalists, and they each valued nation, nationality, and nationhood as critical and important to their respective political visions and ideologies. Nationalism was everywhere in the 19th century, as people carved new nation-states out of empires. Nationalist leaders changed the way people thought of themselves and the places they lived by reinventing education, military service, and the relationship between government and governed.<br />But what does it mean to adhere to nationalism and to be a nationalist? If we need nationalism explained, what guidance can be given to us by the other ideologies?<br />This video explores, explains and examines the concepts and distinctions of nationalism, including liberal nationalism, conservative nationalism, expansionist nationalism, anti-colonial nationalism, civic nationalism, cultural nationalism, religious nationalism, ethnic nationalism, and others; as well as the stances and opinions of other distinct ideological groups such as liberals, conservatives, fascists, communists, socialists, and anarchists.<br />Nationalism, through its espousal of the nation state, has shaped modern history more than perhaps any other political ideology, and it has continued to change its appearance in response to ever-shifting global conditions.<br /><br />00:00 Introduction<br />00:46 Terminology<br />02:02 History of Nationalist Movements<br />07:09 Origins of Nationhood<br />09:12 Core Themes of Nationalism<br />11:40 Types of Nationalism<br />15:48 Interpretations by other ideologies<br />20:00 Conclusion<br /><br />Bibliography:<br /><br />• Anderson, Benedict (2006) [1983].
