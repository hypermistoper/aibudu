{% raw %}The eyes and ears of the world have been on the news from Ukraine for months... As the fighting in the region intensified in the cities of the east, a terrible claim came from Ukraine. The Russian military continues its attacks on the Azovstal plant located in Mariupol, Ukraine. The factory, where Ukrainian soldiers who continue their resistance to Russia are located, was allegedly attacked by the Russian army with a phosphorus bomb. In a statement on the social media account of Petro Andriushchenko, an Adviser to the Mayor of Mariupol, the following statements were made; 'Yesterday the invaders used incendiary bombs or phosphorus bombs for the first time against the defenders of Mariupol (we will leave the result to the experts). The invaders claim that a 9M22C incendiary bomb with a termite layer was used. The combustion temperature is about 2 thousand-2 thousand 500 degrees Celsius. It is almost impossible to stop the burning.' A video showing the Russian attack on the steel mill was posted on social media channels on Sunday. The image in question soon went viral on social media.{% endraw %}
