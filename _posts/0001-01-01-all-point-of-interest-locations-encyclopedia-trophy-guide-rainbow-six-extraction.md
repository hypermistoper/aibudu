The first being in the very bottom right corner of the map. It's the van that has crashed through the wall into the building. The second one is just inside the entrance to the hospital at the bottom middle of the map. It'll be next to the sandbags in the middle of the room. The last being just to the left of there inside the shop. The point of interest is the first set of shelves closest to the entrance to the shop.<br />If there's any others that you find I've missed, let me know in the comments.<br />Good luck with the hunting!{% endraw %}
