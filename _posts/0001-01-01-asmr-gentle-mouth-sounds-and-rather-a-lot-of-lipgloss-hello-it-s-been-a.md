{% raw %}Hello...it's been a while since I was last here but I promised I would return and so...without further ado...here's a combination of mouth sounds to suit a wide variety of tastes and wotnots. It was, as is often the case, a sort of impromptu recording although it wasn't without its challenges...which I won't bore you with because I now only have the use of one arm and it's not my good one...a tale for another time.  If you hear tiny little pinging sounds during the video, that was the awakening of the ladybirds inside my venetian blinds...about 200 of them I think.  I swear they have a ping pong table and a disco and fizzy pop.<br /><br />But in all seriousness, I knew that if I didn't record yesterday, I would never really return because time away does weird things<br /><br />I am mostly active on instagram at the moment although my asmr is truly not well received on there so I'm likely to just keep it for pictures and other short clips of whatever takes my fancy but I am going to try to make it to the end of the month before I make the decision as to whether I stay there or leave.<br /><br />I'll leave you to enjoy and I will catch up on the comments tomorrow if that's ok because I need to rest and possibly make a visit to the A and E department.<br /><br />Kisses and kindness<br /><br />Annie<br /><br /><br />#asmrmouthsounds #gentlemouthsounds #asmrlipgloss{% endraw %}
