{% raw %}Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery speaks circa 1965 about his life and wisdom.<br />From: &quot;Field Marshall Montgomery - Lord Taylor Interviewing&quot; on youtube.<br /><br />Keys<br />1. Conquer Yourself. (You) (self obsession, tyrant-ism, ego, poor me) <br />2. Delegate the work to those who can best do the work. (them)<br />3. Be visible, make a big noise, do it all for them.<br />4. Ask for nothing in return; financially or materially, of them.<br /><br />In other words, what I think he is saying is: to be the big person with all the motivation in the world, you must be coming from a place of having won the internal battle within ones-self first. That way, you have no worries or hang-ups.  Deal with what you can deal with (You) and giving everything else - your eyes and ears, your heart and motivation - to the team. A leader comes last, but pushes everyone else forwards, ahead. A leader can motivate millions if they are genuine, and push progress on faster than the team itself could push itself on, by being the rock of unbreakable confidence.{% endraw %}
