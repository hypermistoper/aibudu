{% raw %}Why do we move our cow mob twice a day in the winter? By keeping the cow mob on fresh clean pasture with twice daily moves the animal performance is outstanding. We do not have to work our cattle because they are not subjected to fouled manured areas. The positive attitude of livestock that are moved is amazing, it makes their whole day better!
