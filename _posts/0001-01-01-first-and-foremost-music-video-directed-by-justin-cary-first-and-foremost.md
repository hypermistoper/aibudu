{% raw %}First and Foremost is a local band in Wichita, KS that came to me with the idea of shooting a music video. We chose to shoot the video in an abandoned warehouse and to shoot live footage only. (It was freezing cold btw) The shoot ran about 5 hours and some change... quick and dirty in and out. If we were to reshoot this video I'd schedule a good 12-18 hours and plan 3x as many shots. Live and learn.<br /><br />I shot with the Canon 5DMKII and used the 50mm f/1.4 and 17-40mm f/4.0.<br /><br />Let me know what you think!{% endraw %}
