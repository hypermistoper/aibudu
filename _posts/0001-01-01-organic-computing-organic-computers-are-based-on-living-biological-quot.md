{% raw %}Organic computers are based on living, biological &quot;wetware&quot;. This video reports on organic computing research in areas including DNA storage and massively parallel DNA processing, as well as the potential development of biochips and entire biocomputers.<br /><br />If you are interested in this topic you may enjoy my book “Digital Genesis: The Future of Computing, Robots and AI”.
