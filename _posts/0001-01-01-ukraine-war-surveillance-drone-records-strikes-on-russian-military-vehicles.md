{% raw %}Surveillance Drone footage released by a Pro-Ukrainian source shows a series of alleged drone strikes on Russian military vehicles in a undisclosed location.<br /><br />What we can get from the strikes is that mainly Russian MRAP and Trucks were targeted by the strikes.<br /><br />Ukraine recently released several videos of Turkish made Bayraktar TB2 drones conducting strikes on Russian military vehicles but we can not say for sure that TB2 were involved this time.<br /><br />Based on the damage dealt by the strikes it is also possible that the drone could have directed some other type of fire such as mortars for example.<br /><br />WarLeaks - Military Blog covers events, news, missions &amp; facts from the United States Armed Forces including the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy,  U.S. Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard and more!
