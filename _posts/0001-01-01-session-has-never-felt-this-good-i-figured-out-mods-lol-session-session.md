{% raw %}Session has NEVER Felt This Good! (I figured out mods lol). I recently made a Session video where I struggled to figure out how to update all my Session mods to be compatible with the new Session update. Thank to your comments, I was available to do a fresh Session install and get all the new updated mods! Session is obviously a very promising game without any mods needed, but I really did forget how game changing the mods can be. It really does add a LOT to the game!<br /><br />TUNE INTO MY STREAMS LIVE!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitch.tv/garrettginnerlive">http://www.twitch.tv/garrettginnerlive</a><br /><br />BECOME A MEMBER OF THE CHANNEL: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqjFp0sgTYc8eU24tTuM9rg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqjFp0sgTYc8eU24tTuM9rg/join</a><br /><br />DONATE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://streamlabs.com/garrettginner/tip">https://streamlabs.com/garrettginner/tip</a><br /><br />SHOP CLOTHES: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.falkinco.com">http://www.falkinco.com</a><br />@garrettginner on all socials<br />Gaming insta: @garrettginnergaming <br /><br />DISCORD:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/V7ZReJX">https://discord.gg/V7ZReJX</a><br /><br />Oh, you're still reading the description? That's kinda weird. I guess I'll tell you a bit about myself. My name is Garrett Ginner, I like skateboarding, playing video games, and having fun. I have my main channel where I post vlogs and that kinda stuff, and I decided to start this channel because I've always had a love for playing video games. Now, I'm not actually good at any video games, so I spend a lot of my time playing action games like Skater XL, Descenders, Beam NG, Skate 3, etc. but I'm always looking for new games to play. Ok I really don't know what to type here so I'm just gonna stop. Bye now.<br /><br />#garrettginnergaming #gaming #session #sessionmods #sessionskatesim{% endraw %}
