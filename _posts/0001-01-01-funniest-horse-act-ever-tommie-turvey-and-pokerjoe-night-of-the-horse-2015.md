He performs his signature acts to sold-out crowds in North America and has dedicated his life to brining the power and beauty of the horse to the forefront with stunning entertainment and inspiring demonstrations.  Tommie also conducts clinics teaching his no-nonsense ideals.  <br /><br />One hugely popular act stars Pokerjoe, beloved for his endearing comedy antics, which earned him the coveted distinction as a Breyer horse model.  <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.breyerhorses.com/pokerjoe">https://www.breyerhorses.com/pokerjoe</a><br /><br />Tommie trained eight Budweiser Clydesdales for their starring role in the 2013 Super Bowl commercial, which lit up social media.  <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiJqzdOr4Ok">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uiJqzdOr4Ok</a><br /><br />Among his accomplishments, heâ€™s won the Screen Actors Guild Ensemble Cast Stunt Award for Batman Dark knight, performed at the 2010 World Equestrian Games,  and earned the National Finals Rodeo Specialty Act Buckle.  <br /> <br />#DMNHS<br /><br />Websites:<br /><br />Equine Extremist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.equineextremist.net/">http://www.equineextremist.net/</a><br /><br />Tommie Turvey:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.tommieturvey.com/">http://www.tommieturvey.com/</a><br /><br />Del Mar National Horse Show:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.delmarnational.com/">http://www.delmarnational.com/</a>{% endraw %}
