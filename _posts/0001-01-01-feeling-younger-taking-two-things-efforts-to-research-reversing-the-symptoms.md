{% raw %}Efforts to research reversing the symptoms of aging led me to Dr. David Sinclair at Harvard and his anti-aging research lab. Now, I'm not only looking younger, but feeling decades younger than I am at age 56.  Feeling younger began for me two years ago when I started taking Resveratrol and in 2020, I started also taking NMN.  This is my story of some would call Biohacking, leading up to my personal transformation and the ways these two supplements have impacted my life.  I have many more videos planned, including interviews with top experts in the longevity field and quality of life realm.
