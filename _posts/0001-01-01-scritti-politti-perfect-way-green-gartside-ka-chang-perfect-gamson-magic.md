{% raw %}Green Gartside: “‘KA-CHANG!’ Perfect Gamson magic. David and I were talking about the origin-myth of the guitar 'Ka-Chang'. What was the first such 'Ka-Chang' in recorded history? <br /><br />The Scritti of Fred, David and I never did play live. I remember we had a tour lined up and kinda reluctantly went into a rehearsal place somewhere in Manhattan to figure out how the fuck this album could be played. I was shit scared about performing in public and David has never really seen the appeal of playing live. Fred, on the other hand, was a seasoned veteran. <br /><br />If I recall correctly, it became apparent pretty immediately that we couldn’t reproduce the sound of Cupid &amp; Psyche live, and our hearts weren’t in it. The project was abandoned. The current Scritti line-up figured out a way to play Perfect Way live so we debuted it in Japan 30 years, or more, after it was recorded.”<br /><br />Following a reissue process overseen by Green Gartside the band's acclaimed albums Cupid &amp; Psyche 85 and Anomie &amp; Bonhomie are out now on vinyl.<br />You can buy them here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://scrittipolitti.ffm.to/reissues">https://scrittipolitti.ffm.to/reissues</a><br /><br />#scrittipolitti #perfectway #cupidandpsyche85{% endraw %}
