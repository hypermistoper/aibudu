{% raw %}Faith Elizabeth Hunter, who goes by Liz, was raised in Texas in a family belonging to the Institute in Basic Life Principles (IBLP) – also known as ATI – an ultra-conservative Christian sect established in 1961.<br /><br />As a child, Liz remembers that her family had no television, and weren’t allowed to watch films or TV or listen to any non-Christian music, cutting off their exposure to the outside world.<br /><br />Liz told UNILAD that instead, her entire upbringing was centred around traditional ideas of a patriarchal Christian family, and that most of her education consisted of Bible study, and learning how to be a good wife.<br /><br />Things eventually changed for Liz when she left her hometown to go to college. Her parents had expected that she would ultimately return home and educate her siblings, and eventually her own children, but after making new friends, and going to see a therapist she says she began to realise that something wasn’t right.<br /><br />Subscribe To Our Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubscribeLADbible">http://bit.ly/SubscribeLADbible</a><br />Be In Our Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/ladbiblecasting">http://instagram.com/ladbiblecasting</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ladbible/">https://www.facebook.com/ladbible/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ladbible/">https://www.instagram.com/ladbible/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ladbible">https://twitter.com/ladbible</a><br /><br />#LADbible #UNILAD<br /><br />To license this video please email: licensing@ladbiblegroup.com{% endraw %}
