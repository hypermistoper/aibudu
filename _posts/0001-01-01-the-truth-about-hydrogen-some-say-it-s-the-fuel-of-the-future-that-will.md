{% raw %}Some say it's the fuel of the future that will soon power large parts of our economies. Others say it's just a hoax propagated by the oil and gas industry. But either way, EVERYONE in the energy world is talking about hydrogen. Can it really help us get to net zero? <br /><br />Reporter: Malte Rohwer-Kahlmann <br />Camera: Christian Caurla <br />Video Editor: David Jacobi <br />Supervising Editor: Kiyo Dörrer <br /><br />We're destroying our environment at an alarming rate. But it doesn't need to be this way. Our new channel Planet A explores the shift towards an eco-friendly world — and challenges our ideas about what dealing with climate change means. We look at the big and the small: What can we do and how the system needs to change. Every Friday we'll take a truly global look at how to get us out of this mess.<br /><br />#PlanetA #Hydrogen #GreenHydrogen<br /><br />Global Hydrogen Review 2021 from the International Energy Agency: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/5bd46d7b-906a-4429-abda-e9c507a62341/GlobalHydrogenReview2021.pdf">https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/5bd46d7b-906a-4429-abda-e9c507a62341/GlobalHydrogenReview2021.pdf</a> <br /><br />Powering ships with fuel cells: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zero-emission-container-corridor-hydrogen-3.5.2020.pdf">https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Zero-emission-container-corridor-hydrogen-3.5.2020.pdf</a> <br /><br />Hydrogen-powered aircraft: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LH2-aircraft-white-paper-A4-v4.pdf">https://theicct.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/LH2-aircraft-white-paper-A4-v4.pdf</a> <br /><br />Study on blue hydrogen's emissions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ese3.956">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ese3.956</a> <br /><br />Report on Shell's blue hydrogen plant: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/fossil-gas/shell-hydrogen-true-emissions/">https://www.globalwitness.org/en/campaigns/fossil-gas/shell-hydrogen-true-emissions/</a> <br /><br />Special thanks to: <br />Noel Tomnay, Global Head of Hydrogen Consulting at Wood Mackenzie, for a background interview. <br /><br />Chapters: <br />00:00 Intro <br />00:37 What is hydrogen? <br />01:34 How can we use the stuff? <br />04:41 The hydrogen rainbow <br />08:49 No silver bullet <br />10:47 What's next for hydrogen?{% endraw %}
