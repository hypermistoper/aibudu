{% raw %}You are going to want a hot cup of tea or coffee with this one. It is something a little different. Paul has been working to build for his home, Sellers Home, all the hand made furnishings that can practically be made from wood. This is the story of Paul, the story of woodworking and the story of Sellers Home.  <br /><br />We sometimes do something short and snappy for viewers but this is for those of you who want a deeper dive. Enjoy!<br /><br />The full detailed projects are available with premium membership over on woodworkingmasterclasses.com (we will be switching to sellershome.com soon). <br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />For more free woodworking videos, please consider subscribing to my channel:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PaulSellersWoodwork?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/PaulSellersWoodwork?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Want to learn more about woodworking?<br /><br />Go to Woodworking Masterclasses for weekly project episodes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2JeH3a9">http://bit.ly/2JeH3a9</a><br /><br />Go to Common Woodworking for step-by-step beginner guides and courses: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/35VQV2o">http://bit.ly/35VQV2o</a><br /> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2BXmuei">http://bit.ly/2BXmuei</a> for Paulâ€™s latest ventures on his blog <br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2oWpy7W">http://bit.ly/2oWpy7W</a><br /><br />Facebook- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2JgKHQS">http://bit.ly/2JgKHQS</a><br /><br />Twitter- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/33S7RFa">http://bit.ly/33S7RFa</a><br /><br />Pinterest- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/35X5uTf">http://bit.ly/35X5uTf</a>{% endraw %}
