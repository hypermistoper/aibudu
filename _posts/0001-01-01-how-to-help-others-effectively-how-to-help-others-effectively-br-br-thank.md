{% raw %}How to Help Others Effectively<br /><br />Thank you everyone who has followed along on this journey. Right now I have arrived safely at the Georgia Meditation Center in Atlanta. With only a few days of rest, we have hit the ground running. Our days are filled with teachings, meeting with locals, running classing, participating in ceremonies, public speaking and so on. It has been hectic to say the least; but with this kind of schedule, we need to keep our daily spiritual practice strong. This includes a daily meditation practice. For those who help others, I hope you take the time for some much needed self care. I hope you find this video helpful. #monks #buddhism #mentalhealth<br /><br />Timestamp<br />0:00 Intro<br />2:16 Hello from Atlanta, Georgia<br />4:53 Updates<br />10:35 Do your own work<br />14:32 Three categories of people<br />16:38 Lifeguard analogy<br />19:10 Keep foundation strong<br /><br /><br />______________________________________________________<br /><br />âœ… Venerable Nickâ€™s Website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nickkeomahavong.com/">https://www.nickkeomahavong.com/</a> <br /><br />______________________________________________________<br /><br />Ordination Opportunities:<br /><br />ðŸ”¶ Be a Monk Ordination Program: With minimalism and simplicity at its core, The Pa Pae Meditation Retreat gives Westerners the opportunity to ease into becoming a monk in a forest setting for those seeking short term and long term ordination.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://beamonk.org/">https://beamonk.org/</a><br /><br />______________________________________________________<br /><br />Meditation Retreat:<br /><br />ðŸ”¶ (Chiang Mai, Thailand) Join the Pa Pae Meditation Retreat if you would like to meditate in the beautiful nature of the Chiang Mai mountains.
