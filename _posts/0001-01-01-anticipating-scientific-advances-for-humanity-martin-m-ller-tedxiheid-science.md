{% raw %}Science and technology are moving forward very rapidly, at a rate which is faster and with cumulative consequences that are more important than ever seen before, with the potential to re-define humanity’s future as a species: the way we live together – and the future of our planet. So what to do? The response calls upon our ability to anticipate major converging and mutually reinforcing science advances in the coming 25 years and imagine a collective future where those advances would be deployed for the benefit of humanity. Martin Müller is Executive Director of the Academic Forum at GESDA – the Geneva Science and Diplomacy Anticipator. As such, he acts as the interface with the global science community and leads the rolling development of the Science Breakthrough Radar, GESDA’s tool for science anticipation. Prior to joining GESDA, Martin was heading SwissCore in Brussels, working at the interface of science, science policy and diplomacy. In this role, he helped shape the involvement and safeguard the influence of Swiss ERI organisations with respect to the European Union, its institutional bodies and related organisations, at a critical time in Swiss-EU relations. In addition, he held leadership roles in pan-European science organisations, such as chair of the Science Europe working group on Horizon Europe, the EU’s €80 billion research and innovation programme, and coordinator of a pan-European initiative on strategic planning and funding for large research infrastructures. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
