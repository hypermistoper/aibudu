{% raw %}Some of the objects around you that you never pay attention to, may actually become really useful and have a function you've never even thought about. Take a banana peel, for example. If you rub your leather shoes with the inside of the peel, they'll shine just as gleaming as they would if you used some fancy shoe care products.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this video I'm gonna show you 26 chances to reinvent ordinary objects. From a cool way to tie a bathrobe, to building a wonderful country house using one or several shipping containers. Wanna know how? I'm gonna show you!<br /><br /><br /><br />#brightside<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS<br />Burger 00:00<br />Post-it 00:26<br />Banana peel 00:43<br />Eating an apple 01:16<br />Round-shaped cheese 02:04<br />Ice-cream 02:23<br />Colander 03:12<br />Hairdryer for painting 03:50<br />Bread as a pot 04:30<br />Tie a towel 05:00<br />Heel lock 05:16<br />Shipping containers 05:40<br />Lettuce 06:08<br />Nail polish 06:42<br />Fruit plate 07:30<br />Sauce bottle 07:50<br /><br />SUMMARY<br />- The best way to eat a burger is to flip it upside down;<br />- If you peel post-it from the side, you will avoid this effect;<br />- Rub your leather shoes with the inside of banana peel. They'll shine just as gleaming as they would if you used some fancy shoe care products;<br />- If you begin biting your apple from bottom to top, you'll easily eat the core with the rest of the apple;<br />- Round-shaped cheese or ham don't always fit square-shaped toast bread. But you can cut 2 round pieces of ham or cheese in half and place them on your toast so that their straight sides face the crust;<br />- If you love eating ice cream out of the carton but hate the feeling of freezing fingers, use a large mug as a coaster, and your hands will stay warm;<br />- You're not supposed to dump the food out of the pan into your colander. Put the rounded side of your colander inside the pan and drain the water;<br />- You can use a hairdryer to dry your painting, speed up the process of wall patching, or dry your wet shoes;<br />- Use bread as a pot or a soup bowl. Just choose a loaf of suitable shape, cut off its top, remove all the crumb and put your food inside;<br />- Try to wrap the towel around your waist and then tuck the excess fabric underneath;<br />- People buy second-hand shipping containers, bring them home, and build cozy houses with all utilities, including electricity, plumbing, wi-fi, and so on;<br />- Tear off lettuce leaves that you're going to eat and put the pot with the roots in a half-full glass of cold water. After a while, you'll get fresh leaves;<br />- Close the lid of your nail-polish tightly and put the glass bottle in hot water for a while. After a couple of minutes, your nail polish will be liquid again;<br />- You can easily move all the sauce to the top of the bottle. Hold it upside down, and then swing your arm like you're about to pitch.<br /><br />Animation is created by Bright Side.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Music by Epidemic Sound <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com">https://www.epidemicsound.com</a> <br /><br />Check our Bright Side podcast on Spotify and leave a positive review! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/0hUkPxD34jRLrMrJux4VxV">https://open.spotify.com/show/0hUkPxD34jRLrMrJux4VxV</a> <br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a> <br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside">https://www.facebook.com/brightside</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightside.official">https://www.instagram.com/brightside.official</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@brightside.official?lang=en">https://www.tiktok.com/@brightside.official?lang=en</a> <br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me">http://www.brightside.me</a>{% endraw %}
