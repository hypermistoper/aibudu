This is because using a credit card is fantastic for payment protection and building a strong credit score,.<br /><br />Money Tip 3:  Always Make Connections.<br /><br />Building strong connections in your life is so important, as it gives you options, advice, valid opinions, and also constructive criticism from people who actually know what they're talking about.<br /><br />Money Tip 4:  Developing Passive Income.<br /><br />Passive income can range from anything from stock market investing to dropshipping, multiplying your money and making money while you sleep is crucial when trying to become a millionaire. Every day you sit on the fence, debating where to put your money, your money could've been making you money.. Waiting to invest is costing you a fortune.<br /><br />Money Tip 5: No One Wins An Argument.<br /><br />People always say â€˜You don't have to win every argumentâ€™ but If iâ€™m being honest, no one wins an argument. <br /><br />If you think you won an argument, the chances are you just burnt a bridge, and you never know who knows who, or where that person will be in 5 years. It links back to building connections, not only do you have to build them, you need to maintain them.<br /><br />Next time you can feel yourself getting into an argument, ask yourself is this really necessary? After all, no one wins an argument!<br /><br />Money Tip 6: If You Don't Ask... You Don't Get.<br /><br />This is a pretty famous saying, and let's be honest.. it's so true. Whether you're in a shop bartering, asking for a pay rise, or you just want some extra pocket money. If you don't ask... you quite simply, don't get. <br /><br />Money Tip 7: Don't Waste Time Hating.<br /><br />Your most valuable asset Is your time, therefore the most dangerous risk of all is to waste it complaining about others and not making progress towards your dreams.<br /><br />Remember, when you get angry, your brain doesn't function at full capacity. Thereâ€™s a brilliant book called the chimp paradox which calls this the â€˜chimp part of your brainâ€™. When the chimp is in control, you aren't able to come up with effective solutions to the problems youâ€™re facing.<br /><br />Money Tip 8:  After Each 'Disaster'... Ask Yourself, 'In 5 Years, Will This Matter?'<br /><br />We can spend so much time stressing and worrying about things we can't change, but I always like to look at it like this, if it won't matter in 5 years, why does it really matter now? emotion is temporary and it's important to let time do its thing.<br /><br />Money Tip 9: The Best Time To Start Is Now!<br /><br />Every year people set New Year's resolutions but I've got to be honest.. I've never believed in any of that. There is absolutely no better time to start, than now. Just think, every day you're not doing it, someone else is.. and that's only leaving you further behind.<br /><br />Money Tip 10:  Work Smarter, Not Harder.<br /><br />The world is full of hard workers that arenâ€™t very successful, itâ€™s all about focusing that hard work in a smart direction.<br /><br />A great example of working smarter not harder would be having a side hustle like dropshipping, this is when you let other people handle all the manual labor while you're somewhere else with your laptop.<br />________________________________________________<br />JOKE: But don't try this with your homework as you might get in trouble.. well only if you get caught!<br />My Links:<br />âž¥ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/marktilbury">https://www.instagram.com/marktilbury</a><br />âž¥ Snapchat: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.snapchat.com/add/marktilbury">https://www.snapchat.com/add/marktilbury</a><br />âž¥ My Second Channel:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.YouTube.com/c/marktilburyxtra">https://www.YouTube.com/c/marktilburyxtra</a><br />âž¥ My Podcast Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.YouTube.com/c/likefatherlikesonpodcast">https://www.YouTube.com/c/likefatherlikesonpodcast</a><br />âž¥ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/marktilbury">https://twitter.com/marktilbury</a><br />âž¥ Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/hXjW6pY">https://discord.gg/hXjW6pY</a><br />________________________________________________<br /><br />CONTACT:<br />For business inquires only, please use this email: mark@marktilbury.com<br /><br />*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Mark Tilbury will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
