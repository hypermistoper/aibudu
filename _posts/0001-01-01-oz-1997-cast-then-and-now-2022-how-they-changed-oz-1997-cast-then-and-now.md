The series finale aired February 23, 2003.<br />&quot;Oz&quot; is the nickname for the Oswald State Correctional Facility, formerly Oswald State Penitentiary, a fictional level 4 maximum-security state prison.<br />The nickname &quot;Oz&quot; is also a reference to the classic film The Wizard of Oz (1939), which popularized the phrase, &quot;There's no place like home.&quot; In contrast, a poster for the series uses the tagline: &quot;It's no place like home&quot;. Moreover, most of the series' story arcs are set in &quot;Emerald City&quot;, a wing named after a setting from the fictional Land of Oz in L.
