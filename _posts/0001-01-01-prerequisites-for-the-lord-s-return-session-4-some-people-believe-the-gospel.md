{% raw %}Some people believe the gospel is 'get saved' and then wait for heaven where we'll get a comfy cloud to sit on, a harp to play, and ... well, that's it. However, salvation is merely the doorway to a lifelong pathway to fullness and glory. As born again believers, we start out as spiritual babies, content with having a ticket to heaven. But as we grow in our faith, we learn there is more to the Christian life than that. We discover it isn't an easy path to travel being a disciple of Christ. It involves travail, suffering, warfare, and the work of the cross in our lives, all of which is making room for Jesus to occupy and fill us with His life. As members of the body of Christ, we need to grow up. As the bride of Christ, we need to make ourselves ready for our Bridegroom.<br /><br />One of the prerequisites for the Lord's return for His bride, the body of Christ, is our coming to full maturity, from seed to a fruit-bearing tree. We are to grow up in Christ, grow in the knowledge of Him, grow as individuals in our walk with the Lord and corporately as we are related to one another. This session is all about growing in the grace and knowledge of our Savior, and coming to the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ.<br /><br />www.dougriggs.org<br />www.bookministry.org{% endraw %}
