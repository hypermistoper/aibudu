{% raw %}The photograph analyzed here (ESP_057869_1195) was acquired by NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter on 30 November 2018 and is described as 'USGS Dune Database Entry Number 2592-602.'<br /><br />Here I feature various anomalies I discovered at a site East of Ross in a region of Mars called Aonia Terra. <br /><br />The first anomaly looks like a capsized boat/ship, there are also two virtually identicaldisc-shaped anomalies, various megalithic blocks with knobs or protrusions on them (one in in the shape of a cross), structure-type anomalies and objects that look sculpted/fossilized.<br /><br />As always, until we get to see these anomalies up close and personal, I can only speculate as to what these objects might be.<br /><br />My Blog Post featuring: 'Possible Boat, Identical Discs and Other Anomalies Spotted East of Ross on Mars:'<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mars.raptorzone.co.za/2022/04/04/possible-boat-identical-discs-and-other-anomalies-spotted-east-of-ross-on-mars/">https://mars.raptorzone.co.za/2022/04/04/possible-boat-identical-discs-and-other-anomalies-spotted-east-of-ross-on-mars/</a><br /><br />Original NASA Source:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.uahirise.org/ESP_057869_1195">https://www.uahirise.org/ESP_057869_1195</a><br /><br />Please comment below and let me know what you think.<br /><br />Contributions (PayPal):<br /><br />Your contribution, no matter how small, will help me to cover my Internet fees which include broadband access and hosting of my Blog.
