{% raw %}OUR NEW BIG TRUCK FOR THE RELIEF OPERATION TO DINAGAT ISLANDS IS AWESOME!<br /><br />This was such an inspiring morning in Surigao City!  The big Fighter Truck showed up full of building supplies and relief goods for our mission to Dinagat Islands.  After meeting up with the team by the port, we headed over to this Philippines Island Province and met up with the army.  The Philippine Army has been awesome at supporting us throughout our relief missions and it was no different on this day!<br /><br />We are headed back to Dinagat to help those affected by Super Typhoon Odette.  Thank you everyone who has been helping around the Philippines. <br /><br />Power On!<br /><br />*** FOR HAMMOCKS AND SHIRTS JUST MESSAGE VIAJERO OUTDOOR CENTER ON FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://web.facebook.com/viajerocdo/">https://web.facebook.com/viajerocdo/</a><br /><br />*** FOR MORE STORIES AND ADVENTURES CHECK OUT MY FACEBOOK PAGE: #BecomingFilipino{% endraw %}
