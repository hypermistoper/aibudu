{% raw %}In this workout, Shelley uses Metabolic training to help you improve your explosive strength and power. This is a very fun and engaging way to train strength with a single dumbbell or kettlebell. Exercises are full body and will challenge you to improve your strength without needing to have a heavyweight set or machines. A kettlebell can be used in place of a dumbbell.<br />_______________________<br /><br />Looking for more workouts?
