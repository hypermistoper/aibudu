{% raw %}Preston forced me to spend Robux in order to reach the new Ocean World. I felt I was forced because I had 6 pets in the dark tech machine. So I became pay 2 win cringe in order to unlock The Void! Oh, I'm such a sussy cringe... And now my heart is full of pain. I must give back to the people all of my hard work gathering pets. The adventures of Vitamin D and Winston in Pet Simulator X must come to an end... All that things end in time. But in these ashes, new heroes arise. A new hero to take on the mantle and continue the path... A rebirth if you will...<br /><br />► I stream LIVE on my second channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFNnBvc8DAhEj1lc4syr0yA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFNnBvc8DAhEj1lc4syr0yA</a><br /><br />Follow me if you're cool:<br /><br />➤ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/VitaminDeeeeee">https://twitter.com/VitaminDeeeeee</a><br />➤ TikTok if you want to see my doge: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vitamindelicious">https://www.tiktok.com/@vitamindelicious</a><br />Business Inquiries: itsvitamindelicious@gmail.com<br /><br />Some music by Evan King<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ContextSensitive/">https://www.youtube.com/c/ContextSensitive/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EvanKingAudio">https://twitter.com/EvanKingAudio</a><br />Buy these songs at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://evanking.bandcamp.com">https://evanking.bandcamp.com</a><br />Or grab it as a free download at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.context-sensitive.com/">https://www.context-sensitive.com/</a><br /><br />#PetSimulatorX #SusCringe{% endraw %}
