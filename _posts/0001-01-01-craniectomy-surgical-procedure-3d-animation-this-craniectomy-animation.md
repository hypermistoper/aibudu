{% raw %}This craniectomy animation is for patient education, which shows how surgery is done to remove a part of your skull in order to relieve pressure in that area when your brain swells. A craniectomy is usually performed after a traumatic brain injury. It's also done to treat conditions that cause your brain to swell or bleed.<br /><br />For more information about procedural, training or custom 3D medical animations, please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amerra.com/.">https://www.amerra.com/.</a>{% endraw %}
