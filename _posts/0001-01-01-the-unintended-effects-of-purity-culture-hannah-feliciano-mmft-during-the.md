{% raw %}During the 1990’s and 2000’s the Purity Movement took hold in many Christian churches around the U.S., establishing an expectation for young people to not engage in pre-marital sex. Many of the messages of the movement were shaming and hurtful, and today many young adults carry the effects. The question we are asking now is, “How do we learn from this and do better?”<br /><br />Hannah Feliciano practices marriage &amp; family therapy at Insight Counseling Centers’ office in Brentwood, TN. <br /><br />Recorded during Restoration Experience on October 5, 2019 at The Well Coffeehouse in Brentwood, Tennessee. Restoration Experience is a 90-minute conference presented by Insight Counseling Centers. Video recorded by Joshua Mendez. Sound by Trevor Kimball.
