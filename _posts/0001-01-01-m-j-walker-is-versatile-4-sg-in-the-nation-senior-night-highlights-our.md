{% raw %}Our first video on the channel covers a visit to Jonesboro High School to watch 5-star M.J. Walker, the 19th ranked player in the country in the ESPN 100, the number 4 ranked shooting guard in the country, and he has recently been selected to play in the 2017 McDonalds All American Game. Walker showed flashes of athleticism and his nice shooting touch, as well as his playmaking ability. As of today Walker is still undecided on where he will play his college ball. He holds offers from Florida State, Kansas, Maryland, Memphis, Ohio State, West Virginia, UCLA, and many other D1 schools.  <br /><br />Follow us on Twitter: @tfhlifestyle and SUBSCRIBE for more hoops videos.{% endraw %}
