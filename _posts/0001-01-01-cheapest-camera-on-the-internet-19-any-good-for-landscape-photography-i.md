{% raw %}I bought the cheapest working camera on the internet. It cost me just £19 The question is, is it any good for landscape photography?<br /><br />Earlier this week, I purposefully bought the cheapest working camera I could find on the internet. I took a punt and bought a camera for £19! The camera body is a Canon 350D. This camera was released in 2005. It's also important to note that this camera is a general camera. It was targeted at the novice photographer. It's not an old Pro camera, far from it!<br /><br />I intend to run a series of tests to find out just how good or bad 17-year-old technology is by today's standards. Is it still a viable proposition for camera enthusiasts today?<br /><br />Over the coming weeks, I'm going to put this camera through its paces. Whilst this video only covers the very basics I intend to push it and me to extremes.<br />Using only this camera body this is what I will be covering...<br /><br />Very long exposures<br />Fine Art<br />Black &amp; White <br />Woodland Photography<br />Street Photography<br />How large can I print?<br />Using Budget filters<br />Image quality / Post Production<br /><br />I bought the camera from MPB.
