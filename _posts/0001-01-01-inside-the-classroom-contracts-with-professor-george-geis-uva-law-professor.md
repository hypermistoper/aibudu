{% raw %}UVA Law professor George Geis discusses issues surrounding offers and acceptance in contract law with his 1L Contracts class. Taking place early in studentsâ€™ first semester at law school, this session examined questions surrounding what exactly constitutes an offer of a contract, and what constitutes an acceptance of that offer.
