{% raw %}There are many reasons why you should use wood chips in your garden. Wood chips provide great benefits for your plants. Often available for free, wood chips can improve soil nutrient levels, suppress and kill weeds, increase soil moisture levels, moderate soil temperatures, and protect soil from damage. Also known as arborist wood chips, they come from the many trees that are cut and trimmed in many cities and towns. Gardener Scott discusses all of those benefits and tells how to get wood chips for free.
