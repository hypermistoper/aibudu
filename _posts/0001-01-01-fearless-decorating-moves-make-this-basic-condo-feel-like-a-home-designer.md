{% raw %}Designer Olivia Botrie of Dart Studio breaks down how she brought this cookie-cutter condo to life with wow-worthy wallpaper and other bold design elements. The homeowner downsized from a large home and her traditional furniture didn't quite fit the space. See how Olivia made the light-filled apartment family-friendly with a spacious sectional, circular dining table (perfect for casual entertaining) and functional kitchen. You'll love all of the statement walls in the space, from the scenic print in the entryway to the navy, wood veneer wallpaper in the principal bedroom.<br /><br />Design, Olivia Botrie, Dart Studio <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dartstudio.ca/">https://dartstudio.ca/</a><br /><br />Sources: Black basket: Snob Stuff.
