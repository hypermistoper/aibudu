{% raw %}Join in with the Restored crew as they dig into this forgotten 1965 Ford F100. After digging in from its grave of over 50 years, they find out really quick that this thing is covered up with the biggest rat home they have ever seen in their lives. Attempting to dig through the obstacles, the guys find out that the inside of the engine is no better than the outside. Fighting through rusty and broken parts, the guys attempt the impossible in hopes to see this sleeping beauty on the road again. Not to spoil the surprise, but this thing is definitely going to take a miracle to live again!<br /><br />John 11:11 &quot;Then he said, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but now I will go and wake him up.”<br /><br />►►SUBSCRIBE HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa422iqMhGLDX6GVC1gxxlA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa422iqMhGLDX6GVC1gxxlA?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />►►Interested in becoming a Restored YouTube Member? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/32oydR8">https://bit.ly/32oydR8</a><br />►Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.be-restored.com">https://www.be-restored.com</a><br />►►Interested In Donating To The Restored Crew? : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3eRTDuN">https://bit.ly/3eRTDuN</a><br /><br />►►Any business enquires can be sent to: kravenedkustoms@live.com<br /><br />** Like To Send Us Mail?<br />Lance &amp; Wyatt Bush<br />P.O Box 865, Bogata Tx, 75417<br /><br />#willitrun #fordf100 #restored{% endraw %}
