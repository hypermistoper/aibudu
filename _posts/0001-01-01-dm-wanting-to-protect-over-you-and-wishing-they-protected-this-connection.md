So what is Tarot exactly? Tarot is a beautiful practice that serves as a conduit to the higher self/soul (unconscious) and the consciousness (ego). It helps to reveal and illuminate what is unconscious whether it be events, situations, or people who have (or will have) bearing on our lives in a significant way. It helps with clarity and facilitates movement forward in your life with greater understanding. It offers spiritual guidance with regard to those thoughts, emotions, decisions, events, people, or patterns revealed, but it is always our choice (free will) to reflect further on the guidance we receive or to disregard it all together. It’s to help understand a possible cause for previous choices and what can be possibly done to change those dynamics and understand your life process and soul evolution to make better choices moving ahead for yourself. Through illumination, Tarot helps reflect those thoughts or actions already taken (past), in process (present), or as the potential result (future) if we continue in a certain particular direction. It’s a deeply profound craft that has been used for hundreds of years. Tarot cards are said to have likely originated in northern Italy during the late 14th or early 15th century. The oldest surviving set, known as the Visconti-Sforza{% endraw %}
