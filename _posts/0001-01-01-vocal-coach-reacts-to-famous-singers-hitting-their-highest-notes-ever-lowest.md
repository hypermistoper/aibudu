I have been teaching for 16 years and been singing since I was 17. I teach from my own studio and via Skype. I specialise in teaching children, and teenagers pop and musical theatre but I am trained in all genres of music. I have studied every voice technique there is, including Speech Level Singing, Estill, Bel Canto, Robert Lunte, London College of Music, ABRSM, Ria Keen, Kim Chandler, Stevie Van Lange and many more. I have been around! <br />In 2008 I wrote the Vocaltutor Guide, 21 set lessons for singing teachers to get started, learning to teach, and produced 3 vocal exercise CD/Downloads. <br />Find out more about me:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.honestvocalcoach.co.uk">http://www.honestvocalcoach.co.uk</a><br /><br />#thehonestvocalcoach #vocalcoachreacts <br /><br />This video is for educational purposes and is not intended to infringe any copyright.{% endraw %}
