Does it cause you to stop and assess your own behavior or does it send you into a tailspin? <br /><br />A lot of us have a difficult time handling criticism. Feeling criticized can feel like a deep burn to who you are as a person, and can create low self-confidence and resentments. The reality is that we will all face criticism throughout our lives. The better you can get at handling it, and actually making the criticism work for you, the better off you will be in your personal and professional relationships. <br />Although, Receiving and using feedback is an important part of striving to do your best. While positive feedback can be more pleasant, negative feedback is more useful when you're trying to provide an excellent product or service or retain good employees for your business. Implementing a negative feedback loop in your business or role is a valuable way to improve your performance.<br /><br />Book Recommendation<br />The Culture Code: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3tfaxsZ">https://amzn.to/3tfaxsZ</a><br /><br />Check out Think School's Online courses:<br /><br />1.
