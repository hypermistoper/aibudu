{% raw %}Angelina Jolie (Unbroken), Christopher Nolan (Interstellar), Richard Linklater (Boyhood), Mike Leigh (Mr. Turner), Bennett Miller (Foxcatcher) and Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game) discuss their new films, open up about ethics, fears, family and what drives them: &quot;We're all kind of control freaks, right?&quot;<br /><br />&quot;It's an impulse to tell stories, to make things up, to get people doing things,&quot; Mike Leigh, director of &quot;Mr Turner&quot;, explains about film directing. Rookie director Angelina Jolie shares that her passion for directing came to her accidentally and occurred because she wanted to &quot;protect the material&quot; of the script she wrote for the now motion-picture film, &quot;In the Land of Blood and Honey&quot;, in which she made her directorial debut. When asked if the critically-acclaimed film, &quot;Foxcatcher&quot;, changed director Bennett Miller, he said, &quot;It broke me.&quot; Miller explains that the two hour and 14 minute film that audience has seen was once an over four hour cut before it was edit meticulously for a period of one year. Richard Linklater, who filmed &quot;Boyhood&quot; for a span of 12 years, explains that the film making was a &quot;marathon&quot;and a &quot;gift.&quot; &quot;I have a very understanding wife, you need to have a partner that really understands what you're doing and going through because you become extremely focused on yourself and what you're doing,&quot; said &quot;Imitation Game&quot; director Morten Tyldum when asked what kind of toll directing takes on his personal life. &quot;If i really believe that what I'm doing is going to give the audience the best experience possible, I think that comes across [through the film]&quot; Christopher Nolan, director of Interstellar, said about his sense of responsibility while filmmaking. <br /><br />What did you learn about this year's favorite directors that you didn't know before?
