On my channel I get to do things I’m excited about like ninja warrior competitions, tricks, gymnastics, cool flips and tumbling, Minecraft, video games, playing with cool toys, making music, sports, playing games, jokes, and fun skits.  I’m excited to do epic and funny videos for everyone, but especially for boys!  The other members of the Fun Squad are Jazzy, Jack, Kalia, and Kyler.  My favorite channel is Kids Fun TV.  My parents own, manage and monitor my channel. Please be sure to subscribe and turn on notifications so you never miss a video! Welcome to my channel! <br /><br />Kids Fun TV:<br />Kids Fun TV, also known as the Fun Squad, is a fun family friendly channel created by the Skye family. Whether it’s games or fun action skits, the kids and their parents love to have fun and play. We have lots of boys vs girls competition videos as well as twin vs twin games. We love box forts, toys and playing fun and exciting games. Whether it’s playing jokes on their dad with a toy, having an amazing birthday party, singing cover songs, creating movie remakes or having a fun superhero adventure, these funny kids love to have fun and play. Sneaky as a spy and skilled as a ninja, the Fun Squad members team up and work together to solve a mystery in each skit adventure. The children (Jack Skye, Jazzy Skye, Kade Skye, Kalia Skye and Kyler Skye) love to have lots of family fun (with Mom and Dad also) in their skits and games. <br />The Kids Fun TV channel loves making fun videos for kids and fun videos for ages 13 and older. <br />Business &amp; Other Inquiries, please email:  Admin@TheFunSquad.com <br />Fans can send emails here:  FanMail@TheFunSquad.com{% endraw %}
