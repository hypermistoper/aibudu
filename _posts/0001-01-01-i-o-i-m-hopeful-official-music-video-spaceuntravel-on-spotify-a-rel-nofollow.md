I'm fine. Don't worry yourself, you don't have the time<br />So move on, leave me behind while I'm looking for a reason to live my life<br />So I'll scream and I'll shout, until my lungs give out, I'm not running, no, no<br />I've been conflicted and scared but was never prepared to make the choices<br />that I made<br />I won't go and give myself away like this...<br />I've been here before<br />I don't need you<br />I can't hide behind this mask anymore<br />This loneliness is overwhelming me, I tried to close my eyes but I can't sleep<br />From disassociating two hearts that once oh they beat together<br />One was mine, but both were yours, and one laying abandoned on the floor<br />But I'm Hopeful<br />(continued on next page)<br />I won't go and give myself away like this...<br />I've been here before<br />I don't need you<br />I can't hide behind this mask anymore<br />These friends now I lack<br />Their knives in my back<br />Couldn't take it anymore<br />These friends now I lack<br />Oh their knives in my back<br />Wish I stabbed them in yours<br />But in the end, we're human.<br />Yeah I've made my mistakes but how can you say your conscience is so clear?<br />I've been chasing affection from a fear of being alone<br />But it's your attention that I feel I'm owed<br />Cause I'm empty inside trying to fill the void in my heart<br />Over and over, the cycle doesn't break<br />The cycle doesn't break<br />And I know that you've been there too<br />It reverberates, leaving you to feel so insignificant<br />It was in my demise, that led me to do the things that I have done<br />It's nothing personal and it haunts me to this day<br />Do you think I'm proud of myself? Do you think I'm the man I want to be?I'm<br />screaming don't hurt me but I'm the one hurting myself<br />I won't go and give myself away like this...<br />I don't need you, I can't hide behind this mask anymore<br />I won't go and give myself away like this...<br />I've been here before<br />I don't need you<br />I can't hide behind this mask anymore<br />These friends now I lack<br />And their knives in my back<br />I won't go and give myself away like this...<br />-{% endraw %}
