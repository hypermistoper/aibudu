Any attempt to force through a speedy trial today will be met with resistance from many different constituencies, including the full nodes.<br /><br />Bitcoin has been and remains difficult to change. This makes it more robust, anti-fragile, and less vulnerable to attacks on the code.<br /><br />Those who try to force through changes to Bitcoin usually end up wrecking their own reputations (Jihan Wu, Roger Ver, etc.).<br /><br />Not investment advice!
