{% raw %}Why in the...? What in the...? What was going through their heads?<br /><br />Having hosted multiple times throughout the last 3 years, we have heard stories from other host parents, coordinators, students and their friends about some pretty unintelligent circumstances students were placed in... all because... the adult may not have been hosting for the right reasons.<br /><br />So, to shed some light on why an adult should NOT host, I came up with 5 reasons and share them with you here.<br /><br />Host Family, Exchange Student Life is here to help navigate through real life hosting and exchanging to help YOU create an extraordinary experience! <br /><br />Question of the Day: Can you think of other reasons adults should not host? Leave them in the comments below, I look forward to reading them. <br /><br />Host Family, Exchange Student Life on Social Media: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/hfeslife">https://instagram.com/hfeslife</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hfeslife.com">https://hfeslife.com</a><br /><br />hfesLIFE is not sponsored by any exchange program agency. We work with an agency to provide hosting for our students, yet will not give recommendations on which one to choose in order to provide a neutral voice in the hosting and exchanging space. <br /><br />#hfesLIFE #extraordinarystudent #extraordinaryhost{% endraw %}
