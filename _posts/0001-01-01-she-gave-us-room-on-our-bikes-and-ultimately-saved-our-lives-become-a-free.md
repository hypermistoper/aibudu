I've been riding motorcycles since 2015. My first motorcycle I learned how to ride on was a Suzuki GS500F. After taking a motorcycle safety course and finally gaining some confidence on the streets, I decided to purchase my second motorcycle. A Honda CBR600RR. I still own that motorcycle to this day! After some time passed I decided to add another motorcycle to the family. So I purchased a Yamaha FZ-07. That's another bike I still have to this day! Again, more time passed and guess what I did. I purchased my final bike, as of now. A Honda Grom! <br /><br />▶ What's a motovlog?<br />A motovlog is a type of video log recorded by a person while riding a motorcycle or any motorized vehicle. The word is a neologism and portmanteau derived from &quot;motorcycle&quot;, &quot;video&quot; and &quot;log&quot;. A rider who creates video blogs known as a motorcycle blogger, and the action of making motovlogs is called motovlogging.<br /><br />▶ DISCLAIMER<br />All content uploaded onto this channel has neither any affiliation with its uploader nor any relation to the rider portrayed in any way which includes, but is not limited to his or her likeness, residing area or personal identity.<br /><br />#Shorts{% endraw %}
