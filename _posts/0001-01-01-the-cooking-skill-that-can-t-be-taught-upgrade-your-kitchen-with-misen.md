You ask them &quot;how much of that did you just add to the dish?&quot; or &quot;how do you know when it's don?&quot; and they always answer with some variation of &quot;I just know&quot;. Ultimately, the only way to develop that sense of intuition is to cook over and over again. I know half of you are only watching this because YouTube suggested it on autoplay, but I REALLY want you all to start cooking more!<br />+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+<br />Support on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/shaq">https://www.patreon.com/shaq</a><br />Buy Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://internetshaquille.com/merch">https://internetshaquille.com/merch</a><br />Follow on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://internetshaquille.com/instagram">https://internetshaquille.com/instagram</a><br />Shop what I use: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://internetshaquille.com/tools">https://internetshaquille.com/tools</a><br />Watch livestreams: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://internetshaquille.com/twitch">https://internetshaquille.com/twitch</a>{% endraw %}
