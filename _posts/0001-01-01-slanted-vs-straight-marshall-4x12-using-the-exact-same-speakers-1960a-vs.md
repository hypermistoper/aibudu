{% raw %}The two types of Marshall 4x12 Speaker cabinets actually sounds quite different. In this video I play a Slanted 1960A and record it. Then I move it's speaker elements to the Straight 1960B cab and record the same riffs on that one. It's all presented as an A/B comparison in this video. I'm using a 1973 Marshall Super Lead and a 2013 Gibson Custom Shop SG. The cabs are from the early 1970s and the speakers are '71 Celestion G12M25 75Hz.{% endraw %}
