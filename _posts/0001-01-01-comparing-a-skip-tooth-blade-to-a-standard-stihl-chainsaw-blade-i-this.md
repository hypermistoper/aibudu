{% raw %}I this video I show you what I found out when I went looking for a Ripping blade for my Shihl chainsaw. I am not a chainsaw expert. All the info on the blade was obtained for my Shihl dealer and from my own experience. If you have any info that I did not cover please leave a comment below.{% endraw %}
