<br /><br />MORE ON RADHANATH SWAMI:<br /><br />Radhanath Swami was born Richard Slavin in Chicago in 1950. At age seventeen, he traveled overland from Amsterdam to India, where he lived in Himalayan caves, learned yoga from revered masters, and eventually became a world-renowned spiritual leader in his own right. His newest book is The Journey Within Exploring the Path of Bhakti. His acclaimed memoir, The Journey Home has been translated into over twenty languages and has been published in over forty countries worldwide.<br /><br />Radhanath Swami presently travels in Asia, Europe and America teaching devotional wisdom to leading institutions including Harvard, MIT, Google, Apple and The London School of Economics., He can often be found with his community in Mumbai, where he works tirelessly to help develop communities, food distribution, initiatives, missionary hospitals, schools, ashrams, emergency relief programs and eco-friendly farms.{% endraw %}
