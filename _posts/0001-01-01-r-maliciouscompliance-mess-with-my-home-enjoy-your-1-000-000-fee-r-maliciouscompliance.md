{% raw %}r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, OP buys a home out in the country to enjoy a quiet life. A property development firm buys up all of the surrounding land and turns the quiet neighborhood into a suburb. The developers then start pressuring OP into joining an HOA. OP refuses, which causes them to constantly harass OP over and over about the HOA. OP eventually gets sick of it and hires a lawyer. After some investigating, OP learns that the developers broke several laws in building these houses, resulting in fines exceeding $1,000,000!<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:07 Slight audio difference <br />0:22 Going to court, ok<br />6:45 Screw your laundry<br />9:11 I'm English not British<br />12:03 Tech support line in Texas and India<br />12:59 Tiny raise and I'm leaving<br /><br />ðŸ‘Œ r/Maliciouscompliance Mom: &quot;DON'T DISCIPLINE MY CHILD!&quot; Babysitter: &quot;lol ok&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngS42I-iPnA&amp;list=PLQWFBACAObMi3zxX8waBldaJraDNye7tN">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngS42I-iPnA&amp;list=PLQWFBACAObMi3zxX8waBldaJraDNye7tN</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/rslash">https://linktr.ee/rslash</a><br /><br />#reddit #maliciouscompliance #funnyredditposts<br />&quot;Sneaky Snitch&quot; Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) License: CC By Attribution 3.0{% endraw %}
