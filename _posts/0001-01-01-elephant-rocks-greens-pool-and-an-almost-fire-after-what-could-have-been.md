{% raw %}After what could have been a disaster, but luckily turned out to be a fairly easy fix, the rest of our adventures through the Great Southern region of Western Australia were magical as we explored the perfectly white sands and crystal clear aqua waters between Pemberton and Cozy Corner (about half way between Albany and Denmark).<br /><br />Between a cheap farm stay, a night on the side of the road and an awesome 7 night FREE camp, we kept the accommodation costs for the caravan to a bare minimum while enjoying everything each location had to offer. The rocks at Elephant Rocks Denmark DO look like elephants!!! Greens Pool was magical and Cozy Corner a highly recommended free camp to visit... if you are lucky enough to get a spot!<br /><br />Have a watch and please comment at the end as we need your help! <br />Thank you for watching, we appreciate every view our @Lentil Bit Wiser channel receives ðŸ™Œ<br /><br />CHAPTERS:<br />0:00  Sneak Peak<br />0:30 Intro<br />0:56 Smoke Onboard<br />6:56 Pemberton <br />13:44 Cozy Corner <br />19:00 Lowlands Main Beach Denmark<br />21:33 Elephant Rocks, Greens Pool, Waterfall Beach<br />31:17 Please help (QUESTION)<br /><br /><br /><br />#LentilBitWiser<br />#CaravanLife<br />#SeeAustralia<br />#WesternAustralia<br />#ExploringAustralia<br />#DiscoverAustralia<br />#TravelAustralia<br />#CampingAustralia<br />#FordEverest<br />#FordAustralia<br />#Windsor<br />#Vanlife<br />#CampingAustralia<br />#Caravanlife<br />#ElephantRocks<br />#CozyCorner<br />#AlbanyWA<br />#DenmarkWA<br />#CaravanTravelAustralia{% endraw %}
