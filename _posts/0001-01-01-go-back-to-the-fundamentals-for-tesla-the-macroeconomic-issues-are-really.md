{% raw %}The macroeconomic issues are really messing with the market right now. Tesla is down about 25% from the all time high. Some investors are concerned. I just wanted to remind everyone of the fundamentals, and remind you of why you invested in TSLA. <br /><br />We need a reality check here, don't forget how early on in the growth stage Tesla still is, and how much more this company has to go. <br /><br />Follow me on Twitter @teslaeconomist<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/teslaeconomist">https://twitter.com/teslaeconomist</a><br /><br />Support the channel on Patreon<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/teslaeconomist">https://patreon.com/teslaeconomist</a><br /><br />This video is meant for entertainment purposes, not Tesla stock investment advice.<br /><br />#tesla, #tsla, #teslaStock{% endraw %}
