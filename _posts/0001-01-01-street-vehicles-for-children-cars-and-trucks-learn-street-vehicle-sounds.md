We have prepared a compilation of street vehicles for kids by bringing real vehicle videos with vehicle sounds effects. Kids simply love making vehicle sounds. It is important for kindergarten children to learn different types of vehicles. In addition to popular street vehicles such as cars, trucks,and buses; we will learn different street vehicle sound effects such as sports car, ambulance, taxi, school bus, limousine, fire trucks, electric car, tow truck and many more street vehicles.<br /><br />Learning vehicles and transportation sounds is an important milestone for the development of a child's brain. These objects can be seen very often during the daily life a young child. Children become very happy when they see their favourite street vehicle outside. For example, kids love to show a car passing by and imitate the sound of a car's horn. The same happens as well with trucks, police cars, trams, or motorcycles. Parents can use this educational video to show their children different types of street vehicles, which are not always easy to see. <br /><br />In this video, we included the vehicle names in 14 major languages to help bilingual parents and children. You can teach your children the street vehicle names in different languages while teaching them the vehicle sounds at the same time.  <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/O1jdcO">https://goo.gl/O1jdcO</a><br />Check out our website → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://kiddopedia.net">http://kiddopedia.net</a><br />Like us on Facebook → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/KiddopediaTV/">https://www.facebook.com/KiddopediaTV/</a><br />Follow us on Instagram → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kiddopedia">https://www.instagram.com/kiddopedia</a><br />Follow us on Twitter → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/kiddopedia">https://twitter.com/kiddopedia</a><br /><br />Street Vehicles List:<br />0:09 car<br />0:29 fire truck<br />0:49 motorcycle<br />1:09 bus<br />1:29 police car<br />1:49 convertible<br />2:09 truck<br />2:29 ambulance<br />2:49 school bus<br />3:09 SUV<br />3:29 bicycle<br />3:49 pickup truck<br />4:09 taxi<br />4:29 double decker<br />4:49 limousine<br />5:09 electric car<br />5:29 street car / tram<br />5:49 minivan<br />6:09 garbage truck<br />6:29 vintage car<br />6:49 street sweeper<br />7:09 scooter<br />7:29 tow truck<br />7:49 tanker<br />8:09 sports car<br />8:29 off-road vehicle<br />8:49 RV / caravan<br />9:09 minibus<br />9:29 ice cream truck{% endraw %}
