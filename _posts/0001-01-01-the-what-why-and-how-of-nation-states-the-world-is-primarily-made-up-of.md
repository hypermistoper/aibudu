{% raw %}The world is primarily made up of nation states - sovereign bodies with very strong borders. This video looks at the history of the nation state, which rose from the ashes of feudalism. We look at why the nation state may not be the primary means for organizing and governing people in the future. The nation state has played a critical role in bringing people together and giving them the structure, governance, defense, and other tools (guns, currency, education, laws) to prosper. However, the internet has connected people directly to each other and the blockchain shows huge promise for creating self-regulating groups (decentralized autonomous organizations), which show potential for small, more tribal-like forms of organization.{% endraw %}
