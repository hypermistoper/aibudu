The Russian Fantasy Adventure film “Upon the Magic Roads: Humpbacked Horse” story summarized with a full ending in हिन्दी explanation. The plot is about a simple yet brave man named 'John' who gets a magical flying horse 'Foal' as a gift because he once saved its mother's life. Now, John wants to sell his luxurious pet to the king in exchange for some good money, but it was attached to John so he harmed the king. Later in retaliation for his humiliation, the king sent John to look for a firebird. Because it was a dangerous bird and no one ever returned with it. When he fails, the tyrant king will put him to death. John accepts the unforgettable discovery and travels with 'Foal' to the forest. Soon the giant bird falls into his grasp, but John sees tears in its eyes and releases the bird. The king was about to kill John but the mighty Firebird saved him.
