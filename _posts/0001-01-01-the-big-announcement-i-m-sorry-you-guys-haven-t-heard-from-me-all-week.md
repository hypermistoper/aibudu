{% raw %}I'm sorry you guys haven't heard from me all week, but I can finally make my HUGE announcement! <br /><br />I am departing as producer of Slightly Offensive and will be dedicating this next year to on the ground covering all of the rallies, protests and events the media refuses to fairly cover. This has been a dream of mine for a long time and I'm excited to get back out on the field. <br /><br />Thank you all for your love and support and we will try to maintain our regularly scheduled episodes of Rapid Fire, but if I can't dedicate a full hour to the show, you can always follow my other accounts for my commentary, research and on the ground coverage. <br /><br />FOLLOW ME:<br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/RapidFire_Pod">https://twitter.com/RapidFire_Pod</a><br />TRUTH SOCIAL: @savsays<br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/savwith1n/">https://www.instagram.com/savwith1n/</a><br />LOCALS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://savsays.locals.com/">https://savsays.locals.com/</a><br /><br />SEND ME NEWS TIPS:<br />EMAIL: savsayscontact@gmail.com{% endraw %}
