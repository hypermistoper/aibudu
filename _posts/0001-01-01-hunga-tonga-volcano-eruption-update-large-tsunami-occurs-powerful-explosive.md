{% raw %}The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano in Tonga on January 15th produced a large and destructive tsunami through a new volcanic eruption. This tsunami occurred due to partial edifice collapse, as the southeast flank of the volcano had become structurally unstable. The tsunami originated after a powerful volcanic explosion which sent a plume of ash more than 20,000 meters or 66,000 feet into the atmosphere. What had just occurred was likely the most powerful volcanic eruption in a decade. This video will separate fact from fiction, and discuss the tsunami, how it occurred, and what might happen next at Hunga Tonga. It is a very famous volcano as it has produced several spectacular island forming eruptions in the 21st century.<br /> <br />Volcanic ash advisory center:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vaac.metservice.com/">http://vaac.metservice.com/</a><br />For information on potential ash advisories of this volcano, select the Wellington center.<br /><br />If you would like to support this channel, consider becoming a patron at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/geologyhub.">http://patreon.com/geologyhub.</a><br /><br />Another way to support this channel is to make an order via our gemstone and geology related etsy store at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.">http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.</a><br /><br />This channel's merch store is also on etsy at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://geologyhub.etsy.com.">http://geologyhub.etsy.com.</a><br /><br />Special Thanks to: @alakihihifo, @platformadam (both on twitter)<br /><br />0:00 A Large Eruption <br />0:24 Volcanic Explosion Heard in NZ &amp; AUS<br />0:53 A Tsunami Hits Tonga<br />1:20 Tsunami Warning US West Coast &amp; Alaska<br />2:00 Why a Tsunami Occurred<br />3:40 What will happen next{% endraw %}
