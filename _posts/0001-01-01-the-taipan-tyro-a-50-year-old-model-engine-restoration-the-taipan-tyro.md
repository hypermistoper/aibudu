{% raw %}The Taipan Tyro is an Australian made, 1.9cc model diesel engine designed and manufactured by Gordon Burford in South Australia. It was the first model aircraft engine I owned and it has sat in a box for the last 40 or so years. I only found it recently and decided it would be  good candidate for a restoration. In this video I discuss the history of Taipan engines, I dismantle, clean and inspect the engine and begin restoring some of the parts. I also visit Colin Maybury who helped with with fuel for this engine and the Titan engine (my previous engine series). <br />The book featured in this video can be found using the ISBN number 9780646524986{% endraw %}
