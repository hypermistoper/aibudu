{% raw %}The LMS Railway built the UKs first mainline diesel locomotive back in 1947.  Sadly this locomotive was scrapped in 1968 before the railway preservation movement was fully established.  <br /><br />The Ivatt Diesel Re-creation Society aims to recreate this lost locomotive and fill a massive void in Britain’s railway history.  <br /><br />This video give a brief history of the locomotive, the society’s LMS10000 project and how you can become involved.<br /><br />Visit our website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://LMS10000.co.uk">http://LMS10000.co.uk</a>{% endraw %}
