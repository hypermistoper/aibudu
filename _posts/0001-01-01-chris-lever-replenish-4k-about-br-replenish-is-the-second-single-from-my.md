{% raw %}// ABOUT //<br />Replenish is the second single from my EP Ripples. It features an instrument called Tape Delay Experiment created by Christian Henson and his chums for Pianobook and is available for free from their website. Also features the Ultrasound pad from Pianobook, which I have now used in some other tracks. The footage was captured with a Mavic Air 2 and the locations were Dartmoor, Cheddar Gorge and Pen y Fan.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the video!
