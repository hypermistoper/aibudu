{% raw %}This video is a part of Conservation Strategy Fund's collection of environmental economic lessons and was made possible thanks to the support of the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the Marcia Brady Tucker Foundation.  This series is for individuals who want to learn - or review - the basic economics of conservation.  In this video, you will be introduced to the concept of perspectives within a cost benefit analysis.  You will learn about the various players in a project (private firms, the bank, the government and society), what are their incentives and how do they measure costs and benefits. <br /><br />To follow this series, subscribe to our YouTube channel.
