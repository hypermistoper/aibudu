{% raw %}Samsung is building a new under-display tech for face ID on the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. You see Samsung and Apple are rivals in the smartphone industry. A lot of you already know this but Samsung builds components for iPhones. Earlier they used to make their A series bionic chips, but now they make memory chips and displays for iPhones.
