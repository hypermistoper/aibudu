Through the power of unity we started revolutions, survived wars and created everything that ever moved humanity. Homo Sapiens are social beings.<br /><br />In these times of the COVID-19 pandemic, the psychedelic movement, in all its diversity, will contribute to this message of togetherness.<br /><br />This is an independent and non-profit project, created by active members of the global psychedelic community. Tailor-made live streamed DJ, live sets and visual VJ mixes, from various locations around the world, will be accessible via our<br /> website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.letthemusicuniteus.com">http://www.letthemusicuniteus.com</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/LetTheMusicUniteUs">https://www.facebook.com/LetTheMusicUniteUs</a>  <br />Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIwxmkYhyY_x_zmkbmrmbNw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIwxmkYhyY_x_zmkbmrmbNw</a><br />We want to give back once again.
