{% raw %}I love making project bags and learned from several sources.<br />I have a playlist here on my channel with many options. <br /><br />I also have a video FlossTube #31 part 2 with lots of details about the measurements and supplies I use.  If you look at the description box  under the video you will see the dimensions. <br /><br />The first one on the list is Jenn Crafts and that's where I learned to make the zipper bags. <br />I've just made them a little bigger to fit the pattern books.<br /><br />I also use Stitched Sewing Organizers by Aneela Hoey and have also adjusted the Zip Top bag to fit my books.<br /><br /><br />RED AND CREAM FLYING GEESE QUILT PATTERN:<br /> Goose On The Loose designed by Carolyn Beam available from Fabric Essentials www.fabricessentials.com.  <br /><br />Correction: <br />Do you See What I See is not a freebie!<br />It's available on Etsy by Primitivestitchin{% endraw %}
