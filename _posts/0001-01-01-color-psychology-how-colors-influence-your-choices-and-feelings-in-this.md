{% raw %}In this video, we look at color psychology and explore some interesting ways color influences your choices and changes your feelings on a rather subconscious level. While we don’t dive too deep into color theory, we do brush up on warm colors vs cool colors - and how they can influence your mood.<br /><br />While a color’s effect on an individual can vary based on its symbolic and cultural meanings, you’ll be surprised to learn how big of an effect colors can have on you. Colours can not only influence your feelings by encouraging happiness or unhappiness; colors affect your appetite, buying choices, and even your attractiveness!<br /><br />The psychology of color is truly fascinating, and there’s so much to learn and explore on this subject. However, you can use this short video as a starting point - to get a basic understanding about colors and their effects in everyday situations.<br /><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Music: Epidemic Sound<br />Visuals: VideoBlocks / Dreamstime / Other<br />Voice-over Recording, Audio &amp; Video Production by Brainy Dose<br /><br />For any copyright related queries please contact us directly at info@brainydose.com<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------{% endraw %}
