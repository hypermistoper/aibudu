{% raw %}&quot;Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it, he who doesn't, pays it.‚Äù <br />- Albert Einstein <br />At first, this quote might seem like a bit of an exaggeration but the math behind it shows that it is not. <br /><br />It's vital to keep a few things in mind when reading ROI figures. For starters, ROI is usually expressed as a percentage because it is easier to comprehend (as opposed to when expressed as a ratio). Second, because investment returns can be positive or negative, the ROI calculation includes the net return in the numerator.<br />When ROI calculations produce a positive result, it indicates that net returns are positive (because total returns exceed total costs). When ROI calculations produce a negative result, it signifies that total costs exceed total profits, resulting in negative net returns. (To put it another way, this investment is a loser.) Finally, total returns and total costs should be considered when calculating ROI with the greatest accuracy. Annualized ROI should be used to make an apples-to-apples comparison between competing investments.<br /><br />ROI<br />Fixed Deposit <br />FD<br />Systematic Investment Plan <br />how to calculate ROI<br />Find ROI<br />Know ROI<br />Points to check before investing<br />investment for beginners<br />how to invest money <br />return on investment <br />return on investment calculation <br />ROI<br />return on investment formula <br />Personal Finance <br />Business finance <br />Bank<br />Banking <br />Finance Institutes{% endraw %}
