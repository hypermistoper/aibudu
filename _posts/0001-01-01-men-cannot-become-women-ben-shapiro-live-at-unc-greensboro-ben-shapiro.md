{% raw %}Ben Shapiro is LIVE at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro to defend the most &quot;controversial&quot; fact of all timeâ€”men cannot be women. Will the leftists attending the &quot;Queer Celebration&quot; just steps from the venue show up for a peaceful exchange of ideas, or will they be hostile in the face of logic, reason, and biology?<br /><br />This event is part of the Fred and Lynda Allen Lecture Series.<br /><br />Ben Shapiro is a nationally renowned attorney, editor-in-chief of the Daily Wire, and the host of The Ben Shapiro Show. Thanks to the the Fred and Lynda Allen Lecture Series, Ben Shapiro, a New York Times bestselling author, partners with YAF to trigger leftist snowflakes on campuses nationwide in the fight against political correctness and safe spaces run amok.{% endraw %}
