In order to hide her tears, she briefly covered her face and was comforted by her husband Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi.<br />There was also another time though when Beatrice was seen smiling during the service. That moment occurred when Prince Williamâ€™s young daughter Princess Charlotte turned around, caught Beatriceâ€™s eye, and the two gave each other big smiles.<br /><br />#Lilibet #Meghan #PrinceHarry #TheQueen #Queen #MeghanMarkle #Wedding #anniversary #Diana #PrinceWilliam #Kate #PrinceCharles #Archie #Philip{% endraw %}
