{% raw %}Dutch Passion, one of the worlds oldest seedbank companies, has tested the MIGRO UVB to determine the effect on terpene levels.<br /><br />They ran a controlled test in a side by side grow, one side with UVB, one without. There was a 19% increase in terpene levels under the UVB fixture, some terpenes increasing by almost 50%.<br /><br />Increased terpenes mean increased flavour and smell. Research also indicates increased terpene levels can lead to a more complex and satisfying effect when consumed. <br /><br />Link to the full Dutch passion blog post here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dutch-passion.com/en/blog/how-to-increase-terpene-levels-in-cannabis-plants-n1037">https://dutch-passion.com/en/blog/how-to-increase-terpene-levels-in-cannabis-plants-n1037</a><br />Everything you need to know about terpenes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dutch-passion.com/en/blog/terpenes-in-cannabis-n890">https://dutch-passion.com/en/blog/terpenes-in-cannabis-n890</a><br /><br />Buy the MIGRO UVB here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://migrolight.com/collections/all/products/migro-uvb-310-fixture-and-fluorescent-tube#">https://migrolight.com/collections/all/products/migro-uvb-310-fixture-and-fluorescent-tube#</a>{% endraw %}
