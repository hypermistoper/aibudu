{% raw %}Compton’s own Buddy slid through the Power 106 studios to drop off his premiere L.A. Leakers freestyle appearance. <br /><br />With his latest ‘Superghetto’ album currently running up on the LIFTOFF show, as tracks like “Wait Too Long” capture the essence of Los Angeles, Buddy took it back for a moment to spit a vibed freestyle over the West Coast icon DJ Quik’s “Pitch In On A Party.” The Nip co-signed rapper flexed his skill boasting, “Obviously I’m a boss, I’m a pimp / Every week you got’ see another freak with me / In any event, I done had plenty of spins / Many men wanna win but they never get in / I got girls that I probably won’t ever see again / I got h*** and I’m still f***in’ all of their friends.”<br /><br />By the end of the nearly three-minute Freestyle 138 feature, Justin Credible and DJ Sourmilk join in during the hook of the infectious Quik instrumental.<br /><br /><br />#Buddy #DJQuik #Freestyle<br />Subscribe Now - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/17Rrvxu">http://bit.ly/17Rrvxu</a><br /><br />Power 106 Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/THwnRX">http://bit.ly/THwnRX</a> <br /><br />Listen Live - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/T0chlq">http://bit.ly/T0chlq</a>{% endraw %}
