{% raw %}Seth Rogen is an actor and filmmaker who’s been a leading comedic presence in Hollywood for damn near 20 years. He has a pair of highly anticipated projects on the way, including the Hulu limited series Pam &amp; Tommy, which is set to release on February 2nd. He’s also got The Boys Presents: Diabolical, an animated anthology series set in the universe of the Emmy-nominated hit series The Boys premiering exclusively on Prime Video March 4th. But how is he with spicy food? As both a Hot Ones and Truth or Dab veteran, we’ve seen Rogen battle the Scovilles before, but now he takes on a brand-new hot sauce lineup in his first solo episode!<br /><br />BUY HOT ONES TRUTH OR DAB THE GAME NOW: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://truthordabgame.com">http://truthordabgame.com</a><br /><br />BUY HOT ONES HOT SAUCE NOW: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/HotOnesSaucesNEW">http://bit.ly/HotOnesSaucesNEW</a><br /><br />HOT ONES MERCH AVAILABLE NOW: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2AIS271">https://bit.ly/2AIS271</a><br /><br />SIGN UP FOR THE HOT ONES MONTHLY HOT SAUCE SUB BOX: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2veY50P">https://bit.ly/2veY50P</a><br /><br />SIGN UP FOR THE FIRST WE FEAST NEWSLETTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://firstwefeast.com/signup">http://firstwefeast.com/signup</a><br /><br />Subscribe to First We Feast on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/UxFzhK">http://goo.gl/UxFzhK</a><br /><br />Check out more of First We Feast here:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://firstwefeast.com/">http://firstwefeast.com/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/firstwefeast">https://twitter.com/firstwefeast</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast">https://www.facebook.com/FirstWeFeast</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/firstwefeast">http://instagram.com/firstwefeast</a><br /><br />First We Feast videos offer an iconoclastic view into the culinary world, taking you behind-the-scenes with some of the country’s best chefs and finding the unexpected places where food and pop culture intersect. #HotOnes #SethRogen{% endraw %}
