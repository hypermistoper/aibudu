{% raw %}We cover all kinds of archaeology on this channel, but one of our favourite topics to cover is archaeological discoveries that have been made recently. There’s nothing quite so exciting as something ancient that’s been made new again by its rediscovery, and the past few years have shown that there’s still plenty out there to be found. Allow us to prove it to you by showing you some startling examples!{% endraw %}
