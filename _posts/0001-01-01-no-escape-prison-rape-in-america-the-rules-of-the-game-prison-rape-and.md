{% raw %}New prison project on Kickstarter : 10 years after making these films on prison rape, I am directing another film that is about this and worse: a man who went away for a small crime in 1979, who was raped and later escaped. 31 years later, after escaping 7 times, he is still in prison. Check out the project here and share it around: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://kck.st/UKTAz1">http://kck.st/UKTAz1</a><br /><br />First part of a Found Object Films short documentary<br />Made for Human Rights Watch<br />Directed by Gabriel London<br />www.foundobjectfilms.com{% endraw %}
