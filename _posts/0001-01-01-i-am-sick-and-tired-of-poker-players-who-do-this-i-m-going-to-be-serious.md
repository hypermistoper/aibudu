{% raw %}I'm going to be serious for a moment here, because I want to discuss an issue that has a major negative impact on televised poker shows. This has been a huge annoyance to me, as I have appeared on many of these shows and had my games affected by this. It's also awful for fans, who just want to watch their favorite players and get the shows that they were promised.<br /><br />Check out Poker After Dark and other shows on PokerGo: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pokergo.com">https://www.pokergo.com</a><br /><br />Subscribe for more wsop vlog, news, comedy, and hand breakdowns. Poker Hands is the show where Doug analyzes live poker hands from tv poker shows such as Poker After Dark, EPT (European Poker Tour), High Stakes Poker, the World Series of Poker (WSOP), the Aussie Millions, WPT (World Poker Tour) the Big One For One Drop, and the PCA (Pokerstars Carribean Adventure). He especially enjoys reviewing hands by popular high stakes pros like Viktor &quot;Isildur&quot; Blom, Fedor Holz, Dan Cates (Jungleman), Tom &quot;Durrrr&quot; Dwan, Phil Ivey, and Daniel Negreanu.{% endraw %}
