{% raw %}Holi cannoli! We completely forgot about our new hamster's birthday! We need to get her something! Sammy suggested that we make a pop-it maze for our Vanilly. And it seemed like a great idea! After all, hamsters love mazes with obstacles.<br /><br />It will be a huge cool maze, and Vanilly will have to try very hard to pass it through. First of all, it consists of several bright rooms. And secondly, there is a huge number of difficult obstacles in each room.  What will Vanilly have to deal with? A wavy bridge, a zig-zag bridge, a bridge with flying rings! A room with pop-it carousel, dancing cylinders, a maze of plastic pipes, the cardboard barbeque room, and more. <br /><br />Each room and obstacle is thought through to the smallest detail and made from ordinary items that you can easily find at home — cardboard, foam paper, pop tubes, wooden skewers, a Pop-It, etc. We are sure Vanilly will love her birthday gift! So, watch this video till the end and be amazed by how our little hamster will pass room by room!<br /><br />Guys, if you loved this craft, give us a thumbs-up, and don't forget to check out more cool crafts for hamsters on our channel: <br /><br />Building Fun Hamster Playground From Mini Bricks <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/a2F4JLf3Lq4">https://youtu.be/a2F4JLf3Lq4</a><br /><br />How To Make A Miniature Hamster Flying Saucer Using A 3D Pen <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/UG8XS_ds2DI">https://youtu.be/UG8XS_ds2DI</a><br /><br />How To Make THE SKELD For A Hamster | Among Us Craft <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/jYTEipnDvos">https://youtu.be/jYTEipnDvos</a><br /><br />This video has English subtitles for your convenience!<br />- - - <br />Baby Zoo Fun Learning:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFehKaGaspc&amp;list=PLyDPzFRwwf3ehyeeem14Q2YZlJoMdwbkK">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFehKaGaspc&amp;list=PLyDPzFRwwf3ehyeeem14Q2YZlJoMdwbkK</a><br />- - - <br />Shop our awesome t-shorts, pop-sockets, and more on Teespring Store <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3fHWRn6">https://bit.ly/3fHWRn6</a> <br />- - - <br />Check out Slime Sam's Community Tab and see his best pictures, funny GIFs, new episode announcements and much more! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw5VDXH8up3pKUppIvcstNQ/community">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw5VDXH8up3pKUppIvcstNQ/community</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Sam's channel and give a thumbs up to motivate him to make more videos for you! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/zarVZo">https://goo.gl/zarVZo</a><br />- - - <br />All product and company names shown in the video are trademarks™ or registered® trademarks of their respective holders.
