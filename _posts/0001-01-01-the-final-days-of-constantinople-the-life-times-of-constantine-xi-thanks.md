Not because Constantine XI is some drab old king bogged down in meaningless politics, of course, but because I was honestly afraid that I wouldn’t be able to do this story justice, because Constantine stood on the shoulders of giants, just giants all the way down, this is the final act Europe’s most enduring and adaptive civilization, and some part of me always hoped I could somehow precede this episode with the two thousand years building up to it, every quote-unquote defensive war preserved in the annals of Livy, every great rivalry, every foolhardy emperor, every twist and turn of court intrigue, ever unlikely rebound against the savage march of time. But at the end of the day, I reckoned that even if I were to survive the tantalizing honeytrap that’s nipped at certain other creators, I would just turn into “the other Rome guy” next to Dovahatty, and there’s simply too much fun to be had nearly everywhere else in the world at every other point in history, and to consign this particular story to the dark chest of tales for another time would be a terrible tragedy. And so without further ado, I give you Constantine XI: The Last of the Romans<br /><br /><br />Music (in order of appearance):<br />Kevin Macleod - Crinoline Dreams<br />Kevin Macleod - Black Vortex<br />Kevin Macleod - Hidden Past<br />Kevin Macleod - Winter Chimes<br />Jacques Cassard - Berliner Polka<br />Kevin Macleod - Angevin B<br />Kevin Macleod - Heavy Heart<br />Kevin Macleod - Eternal Terminal<br />Kevin Macleod - Night Vigil<br />Yakuza OST - Baka Mitai{% endraw %}
