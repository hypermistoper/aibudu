{% raw %}We proudly welcome Andy Anderson to the skate team. Not only can Andy hop onto a 32-stair handrail and handle massive transitions, he has an unmatched imagination for how to skate whatever he sees thanks to his foundation in freestyle. Filmed and edited by Mike Manzoori.<br /><br />With cameos from Pierre-André Senizergues, owner and CEO of etnies, and Don Brown, our VP of marketing, watch Andy skate from our headquarters to the etnies skatepark in Lake Forest.<br /><br />“I’m affiliated with etnies because it was the first skater-owned shoe company. It doesn’t get more OG than that,” said Andy Anderson.<br /><br />Ryan Sheckler said, “Andy is the most unique and talented skateboarder!  I get lost watching him skate, I am beyond excited to finally be on a team with him!”<br /><br />“It is uncommon to cross paths with a young skater whose talents range from freestyle, street spots to transition that can bring it all together. Andy skates it all and appreciates all types of skateboarding roots,” said Pierre-André Senizergues, owner and CEO of etnies.  “Andy skates with the highest level of trick difficulty!  We are proud to welcome him to the etnies team.”<br /><br />Due to the long harsh Canadian winters Andy grew up in, he turned to freestyle to satisfy his appetite for inventive skateboarding. Being anti-ollie in his early days, Andy’s trick selection is as unique as they come, blending an almost forgotten style of board control with a modern eye for where to ride. <br /><br />Andy is skating in our new Rebel Sports collection. The shoes will be available soon.
