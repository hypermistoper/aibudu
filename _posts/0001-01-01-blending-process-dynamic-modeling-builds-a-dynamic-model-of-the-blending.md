{% raw %}Builds a dynamic model of the blending process using mass balances. This case study was inspired by the Blending Process example in Chapter 2 of “Process Dynamics and Control,” Seborg, Edgar, Mellichamp, Doyle, 3rd Edition, Wiley, 2011. Made by Prof. Martha Grover from the Georgia Institute of Technology and produced by the University of Colorado Boulder, Department of Chemical &amp; Biological Engineering.
