{% raw %}There's an art to presentation attention grabbers. Here are 5 bad ways to start a presentation.  <br /><br />&quot;Attention getters&quot; or &quot;attention grabbers&quot; are supposed to do what they say, draw people in. Instead, these five openings distract listeners from the message. <br /><br />FREE 7 Instant Tips for Confident &amp; Composed Public Speaking: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.communicationskillscoach.com/free-7-instant-tips-for-confident-speaking.html">http://www.communicationskillscoach.com/free-7-instant-tips-for-confident-speaking.html</a><br /><br />1. Joke (setup, punchline style joke). Humor can be an effective attention grabber but the typical set-up-and-punch-line-jokes are very difficult to pull off. <br /><br />2. Nervous chatter. This is common. Instead of grabbing people's attention, speakers often fill the space with comments about how nervous they are.  It may win you a momentary chuckle of sympathy but it will not gain people's interest in a positive way. <br /><br />3. Patter (filler). Get right to your message. Don't fill this space with talk about anything other than your specific topic. <br /><br />4. Something unrelated. This is surprisingly common. Speakers sometimes do some type of attention grabber but it has nothing to do with the actual topic of the presentation. It confuses audiences. The attention getter should be related directly to the topic of the forthcoming presentation. <br /><br />5. &quot;Close your eyes&quot; This is just overused. Instead of functioning like attention getters should, these close-your-eyes moments make people uncomfortable. That's not a great way to start your message. <br /><br />Make sure you using actual attention grabbers or attention getters as presentation openings. Don't open with the common but ineffective openings in this video. <br /><br />Alexâ€™s Set Up (Affiliate Links):<br />Camera: Canon 90d: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2sbhjpV">https://amzn.to/2sbhjpV</a><br />Lens: Sigma 18mm to 35mm 1.8: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35g03Ph">https://amzn.to/35g03Ph</a><br />Mic: Shotgun/Boom: Diety S-mic 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35dsLzU">https://amzn.to/35dsLzU</a><br />Mic: Shure SM7B: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2o9fJDe">https://amzn.to/2o9fJDe</a><br />Mic: Lapel: Rode Smartlav+: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LQ3xQJ">https://amzn.to/2LQ3xQJ</a><br />Audio (Portable) Recorder: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/338DREO">https://amzn.to/338DREO</a><br />Audio Recorder: Tascam DR60 4-Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/32ZC9p8">https://amzn.to/32ZC9p8</a><br />Lights: Neewer Dimmable LED: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MgN46Z">https://amzn.to/2MgN46Z</a><br />Lights: Softbox lighting kit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2okM7m7">https://amzn.to/2okM7m7</a><br /><br /> <br /><br />Communication Coach helps leaders like you increase your impact and lead your teams with more excellence.
