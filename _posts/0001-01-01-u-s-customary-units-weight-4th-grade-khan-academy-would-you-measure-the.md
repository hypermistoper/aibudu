{% raw %}Would you measure the weight of your parents' car in ounces, pounds, or tons? Actually, you could measure in all three! However, you want to choose the unit that is most convenient in terms of numbers of units. Let's learn more.<br /><br />Watch the next lesson: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-fourth-grade-math/cc-4th-measurement-topic/cc-4th-us-customary-units/v/us-customary-fluid-volume?utm_source=YT&amp;utm_medium=Desc&amp;utm_campaign=4thgrade">https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-fourth-grade-math/cc-4th-measurement-topic/cc-4th-us-customary-units/v/us-customary-fluid-volume?utm_source=YT&amp;utm_medium=Desc&amp;utm_campaign=4thgrade</a><br /><br />Missed the previous lesson? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-fourth-grade-math/cc-4th-measurement-topic/cc-4th-us-customary-units/v/us-customary-distance?utm_source=YT&amp;utm_medium=Desc&amp;utm_campaign=4thgrade">https://www.khanacademy.org/math/cc-fourth-grade-math/cc-4th-measurement-topic/cc-4th-us-customary-units/v/us-customary-distance?utm_source=YT&amp;utm_medium=Desc&amp;utm_campaign=4thgrade</a><br /><br />Grade 4th on Khan Academy: 4th grade is the time to start really fine-tuning your arithmetic skills. Not only will you be a multi-digit addition and subtraction rockstar, but you'll extend the multiplication and division that you started in 3rd grade to several digits. You'll also discover that you sometimes have something left over (called a &quot;remainder&quot;) when you divide. In 3rd grade you learned what a fraction is. Now you'll start adding, subtracting, multiplying, and comparing them. You'll also see how they relate to decimals. On other fronts, you'll learn how to convert between different units (which is super important when comparing the size and speed of robot unicorns in different countries) and continue your journey thinking about various shapes in two dimensions. Some of the foundational concepts of geometry (like lines, rays and angles) also get introduced. As always, we'll round this out with a healthy dose of applied word problems and explorations of number patterns and properties (including the ideas of factors, multiples and prime numbers). The fun must not stop!
