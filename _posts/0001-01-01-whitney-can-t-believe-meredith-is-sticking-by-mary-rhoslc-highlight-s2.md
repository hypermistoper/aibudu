Perfection here is not an aspiration - it’s a mandate. With a deep-rooted history, these women share a special bond, but when circles are this tight, it’s only a matter of time before beliefs and personalities collide. Whether hitting the slopes, attending parties at Sundance, or hosting the city’s elite, these housewives hold themselves and each other to an extremely high standard and never hold back when things go sideways, but lord knows they are always there for each other when they need it most.<br /><br />Cast:<br />Lisa Barlow<br />Mary Cosby<br />Heather Gay<br />Meredith Marks<br />Whitney Rose<br />Jen Shah<br />Jennie Nguyen<br /><br />About Bravo:   <br />Bravo is the premier lifestyle and entertainment brand that drives cultural conversation around its high-quality, interactive original content across all platforms.
