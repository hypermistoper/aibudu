{% raw %}I Met The Owner Of Brookhaven in Brookhaven... üò≥  It was crazy when he joined, I wanted new things in the game and everything. He is the most crazy owner, and he made Brookhaven RP. Although things get a little crazy, the owner of brookhaven showed us some secrets.

It‚Äôs unique in that practically everything on ROBLOX is designed and constructed by members of the community. ROBLOX is designed for 14 to 18 year olds, but it is open to people of all ages. Each player starts by choosing an avatar and giving it an identity. They can then explore ROBLOX ‚Äî interacting with others by chatting, playing games, or collaborating on creative projects. Each player is also given their own piece of undeveloped real estate along with a virtual toolbox with which to design and build anything ‚Äî be it a navigable skyscraper, a working helicopter, a giant pinball machine, a multiplayer ‚ÄúCapture the Flag‚Äù game or some other, yet-to-be-dreamed-up creation. There is no cost for this first plot of virtual land. By participating and by building cool stuff, ROBLOX members can earn specialty badges as well as ROBLOX dollars (‚ÄúRobux‚Äù). In turn, they can shop the online catalog to purchase avatar clothing and accessories as well as premium building materials, interactive components, and working mechanisms.<br /><br />YouTubers such as @Mackenzie Turner Roblox, O1G, Roblox with Roplex, Calixo, Vuxvux and IamSannaToo are my favorite.
