{% raw %}The hottest geography detective series on the web resumes with the oldest and perhaps the most meaningful photo we've had the pleasure of working on so far. Daniel's grandmother was believed to have been holidaying in Southern England or Northern Europe in the early 50s when this snap was taken, but despite Daniel's painstaking best efforts, him and his family are still none the wiser. My job is to find out exactly where this photo was taken, however, it's not going to be plain sailing. With nothing but a few strands of seaweed, a couple of white buildings in the distance and a strange, probably long demolished wooden structure in the foreground, have I bitten off a bit more than I can chew?<br /><br />Thanks for tuning in everyone, and don't forget to subscribe.{% endraw %}
