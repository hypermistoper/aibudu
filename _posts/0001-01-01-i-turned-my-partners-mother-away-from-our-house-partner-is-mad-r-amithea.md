{% raw %}r/AmITheA**hole In today's episode, Context: I (32f) own my home. I started dating someone (35m) around 18 months ago, and his earnings were impacted by the pandemic so he asked to move in with me. I wasn't 100% comfortable but I agreed. It's been going fairly well.<br /><br />I haven't been able to get to know my partner's family the way I would if things had been organic. We met a few times and I've spoken to them via video call. They seem pleasant.<br /><br />Unlike him, I've been able to work from home for the past year, and the toll it took was that I gained weight. It's not a big problem, but I bought some equipment and committed to working out at lunchtime 3x a week.<br /><br />🍑 AITA For REFUSING To Be The Family's &quot;IT Girl&quot; Anymore? r/AmITheA**hole <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/bYQukFho8k4">https://youtu.be/bYQukFho8k4</a><br /><br />🔔 Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2sW3N6h">https://bit.ly/2sW3N6h</a><br />💬 Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/pnuGntjJ3z">https://discord.gg/pnuGntjJ3z</a><br />🛒 Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mark-narrations.myteespring.co/">https://mark-narrations.myteespring.co/</a><br />🎁 Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/MarkNarrations">https://www.patreon.com/MarkNarrations</a><br />🐦 Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MarkNarrations">https://twitter.com/MarkNarrations</a><br />#redditmom #redditdrama #redditfamily<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:43 Story 1<br />4:48 Story 2<br />10:30 Story 3<br />16:07 Story 4{% endraw %}
