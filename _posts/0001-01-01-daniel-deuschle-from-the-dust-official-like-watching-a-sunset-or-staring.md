{% raw %}Like watching a sunset or staring into the eyes of someone you love, there is a certain type of beauty that is too special to be rushed but must be savored. My desire is that this video gives you glance into a magical world; a landscape that almost only seems fit for the imagination...and in its simplicity, you feel the wonder of a place I am grateful to call home.<br /><br />_______________<br /><br />“From The Dust” Song by Daniel Deuschle | @Daniel.Deuschle (IG)<br /><br />Available for license on Musicbed: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.musicbed.com/artists/daniel-deuschle/43856">https://www.musicbed.com/artists/daniel-deuschle/43856</a><br /><br />Listen to more on Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/34G0pcebo0XbgOO9n6hO2N?si=h3X7xrDPRieTGo_xzL6WMw">https://open.spotify.com/artist/34G0pcebo0XbgOO9n6hO2N?si=h3X7xrDPRieTGo_xzL6WMw</a><br /><br />Cinematography by Dillan Prinsloo | @DillanPrinsloo (IG)<br />______________{% endraw %}
