{% raw %}It didn't feel like a scrimmage with these two heavyweights battling each other just before the season gets started. McDonogh's FOGO appeared to be out with an injury, the LSM filling in held his own all day winning quite a few. McDonogh got out to an early lead before Tucker Wade just took over. This was the first game I ever filmed for either team and had heard about McCabe Millon (Duke Commit who did not disappoint with 4 goals), but today Tucker Wade (Princeton Commit) was not going to be stopped with 7 of his own.<br /><br />The Bullis defenders also stood out to me with their aggressive play, they are an athletic group with some size, and it was fun to watch them come out and attack at every opportunity they had no matter who had the ball. They did not sit back and watch things happen in front of them, their goal today was to take away the ball no matter what opponent had it in their stick.<br /><br />Good luck to both teams in the regular season kicking off this week, I hope to come back out and film a few more games this year for them!
