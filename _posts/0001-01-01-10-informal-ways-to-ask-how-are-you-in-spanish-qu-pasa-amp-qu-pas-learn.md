{% raw %}¿Qué pasa? &amp; ¿Qué pasó? Learn 10+ Spanish phrases to ask &quot;How are you?&quot;. In this lesson, you will learn the topmost practical, idiomatic, casual, and colloquial ways to ask &quot;what's up?&quot; and &quot;how are you?&quot; in Spanish. These informal ways to ask people how they are doing are the ones most used by native speakers. You will need these when you are talking to your friends and family. They are informal but appropriate. You will also learn some slang Spanish phrases to ask these questions. You have probably noticed I do not have many videos about Spanish slang. That is because I prefer to teach you correct Spanish. But the reason I created this lesson is because this Spanish slang is widely accepted amongst native Spanish speakers, so I thought maybe it is good I teach you this for two reasons: you may want to learn Spanish slang, and you may want to understand how Spanish native speakers actually talk in real life with their friends. Since you are my friend, let's cultivate our friendship with some slang.<br /><br />Please donate to Butterfly Spanish:<br /><br />You can donate at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.butterflyspanish.com/">https://www.butterflyspanish.com/</a><br /><br />Or through PayPal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/ButterflySpanish">https://www.paypal.me/ButterflySpanish</a><br /><br />Check out my new website and subscribe to my free Spanish learning newsletter at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.butterflyspanish.com/">https://www.butterflyspanish.com/</a><br /><br />Watch more videos that help you learn Spanish: <br /><br />TOPS SPANISH PHRASES WITH &quot;NO&quot;:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwyhqLAknf4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwyhqLAknf4</a><br /><br />12 WAYS TO AGREE IN SPANISH:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JZ8jdqOuKw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JZ8jdqOuKw</a><br /><br />QUÉ OR CUÁL IN SPANISH:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrFcKURo67s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrFcKURo67s</a><br /><br />8 WAYS TO SAY &quot;I AM SORRY&quot; IN SPANISH:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYDPe6gRPTk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYDPe6gRPTk</a><br /><br />GIVING YOUR ADDRESS IN SPANISH:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBiiiMhIGU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ZBiiiMhIGU</a><br /><br />MONTHS IN SPANISH:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FjSyvyFmvM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FjSyvyFmvM</a><br /><br />SPANISH ALPHABET:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsLYD1Jyf3A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsLYD1Jyf3A</a><br /><br />SPANISH 5 VOWELS &amp; SPANISH VOWEL SOUNDS:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orOW9eRQfpE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orOW9eRQfpE</a><br /><br />Ahora sí no te va a parar la boca :){% endraw %}
