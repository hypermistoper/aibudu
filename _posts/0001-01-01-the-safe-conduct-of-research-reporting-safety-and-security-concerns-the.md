{% raw %}The PNNL community has the responsibility to look out for one another, as reflected in the Safe Conduct of Research principles. This includes having a questioning attitude and situational awareness around our campus, facilities, information, assets, colleagues, and ourselves. One way to practice this care is by immediately reporting any safety or security concerns to the PNNL Security Operations Center. One call quickly mobilizes the necessary resources to respond, regardless of the circumstances. What happens when you call? How are calls triaged? What if a response to a call turns out to be unnecessary? What are examples of why one should call? Calls to the Security Operations Center also contribute to the Laboratoryâ€™s efforts around continuous improvement and best-in-class operations.{% endraw %}
