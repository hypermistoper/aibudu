{% raw %}Last night in Maryland, Jesus delivered these precious sisters! The look on the faces of the girls when they were free is truly one of the most beautiful sights Iâ€™ve ever seen. ðŸ˜­ This family showed up to the church for the Revival is Now Maryland event at 7AM and the event didnâ€™t start til 7PM! Last night Jesus delivered these girls first! Renouncing by the parents was key to the deliverance! The demons were forced to flee! The girls continued to receive more deliverance during the event after this moment. The mother of the girls testified today â€œwe have been on a long journey with deliverance, but for the first time our girls have total freedom!! The youngest, Jacey, who is 8 received not only freedom but also the baptism of the Holy Spirit!â€œ<br /><br />JESUS!ðŸ˜­ Speechless, and Iâ€™m in awe and wonder. Thank you Jesus for freeing these precious girls and this whole family! He is so faithful!<br />.<br />.<br />.<br /><br />#revivalisnow #actschurchisback #revival #miracles #prophetic #propheticministry #deliverance #believer #powerofGod #christian #christianity #faith #Jesus #God #apostle #lachurch #losangeleschurch #believe #miraculous #anointing #love #victory #wisdom #revivalinthepark #freedom #testimony #fivefoldministry #church{% endraw %}
