{% raw %}Americans tend to view the Founders as detached icons, removed from their humanity, They peer down through history from their pedestals, all traces of their daily existence erased, They spoke in lofty platitudes, always concerned with posterity and its judgments, Rather than seeing them with their coats off, up to their elbows in labors both physical and mental, they are viewed in the poses created for them by sculptors, painters and all too often historians and biographers, Judging them without viewing them as what they were, mortal men subject to the temptations and desires of all, dehumanizes them, It creates a false image of who and what they really were, politicians involved in a scandal or two.<br /><br />Thank you for watching!{% endraw %}
