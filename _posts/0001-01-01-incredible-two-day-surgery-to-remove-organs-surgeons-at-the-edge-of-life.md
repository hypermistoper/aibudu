Its surgeons carry out operations that require such expertise, that they are only carried out here and a handful of other centres in the UK.<br /><br />One such procedure is a pelvic exenteration, so complicated it requires two surgeons to perform and two days to complete. The surgeons - colorectal consultant Nicola Fearnhead and consultant urologist Alex Colquhoun - only do around 10 of these operations each year, where due to widespread cancer, all the organs in the pelvis need to be removed. It is such a massive, life-changing surgery that about 50% of people who need the procedure for otherwise terminal illness, decide not to have it.<br /><br /><br />#BBC #Surgeons #BBCiPlayer<br /><br />Surgeons | Streaming now | BBC iPlayer<br /><br />All our TV channels and S4C are available to watch live through BBC iPlayer, although some programmes may not be available to stream online due to rights.
