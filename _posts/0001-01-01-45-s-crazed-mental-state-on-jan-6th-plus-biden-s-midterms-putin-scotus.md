{% raw %}In this episode, Cash Peters, the English Channel casts his third eye over the White House's missing phone calls on January 6th, piling intrigue upon intrigue. Plus, he examines Biden's next twelve months and the Dems' hopes for victory in the mid-terms, and whether Russia's intelligence service will be the ones to take Putin down. He also looks at how much trouble Dan Scavino is in, Clarence Thomas's perilous situation, and does crossover pictures for rock drummer Taylor Hawkins. <br /><br />For entertainment purposes only. Just one guy's waking dream, right?<br /><br />During quieter moments, have you ever debated inwardly about how great it would feel to step up like the hero you are and support Cash's channel? Well, here's your chance to gush with generosity. Spoiler alert: it may give you a fuzzy, warm sensation inside. Donate at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.PayPal.me/cashpeters.">http://www.PayPal.me/cashpeters.</a> Not only is it easy, but each gift, when it's received, is celebrated with a leprechaun kick, or the closest a 65 year-old man can manage, basically.<br /><br />In other news:<br /><br />A) Paperbacks of Cash's book 'A Little Book About Believing&quot;, and also his novel 'Force of Habit', are available on eBay only. The ebook versions are, as usual, on Amazon, but if you want a hard copy, then please head over to eBay.com. 'Why Your Life Matters' is no longer available in paperback, just as an ebook on Amazon. <br /><br />B) Once sets of transition pictures have featured in a video on this channel, they are archived on the sister channel, Soul Crossings with Cash Peters. So for example the Soul Crossings video for Jesus is there - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/X5UKHqEdiLU">https://youtu.be/X5UKHqEdiLU</a> - but there are many more too, including pictures for Yogananda, Mr. Rogers, Martin Luther King, Jnr., Louise Hay, Wayne Dyer, Whitney Houston, Maya Angelou, Ram Dass, Elvis Presley, Bernie Madoff, Marilyn Monroe, Prince, Michael Jackson, Robin Williams, Princess Diana, and others. If you'd like to know what happens to us after we die, that's the place to visit. <br /><br />C) If you'd like to understand how Cash does his pictures, there's a video you can watch. You'll find it here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?">https://www.youtube.com/watch?</a><br /><br />D) Newspaper headlines used in the video are included without the introductory phrase, &quot;And this is how The Washington Post described it' or 'Here's what Forbes said on this topic last week' etc. This saves space and repetition, but that's what is originally intended. Excerpts from books, poetry, or other media are included under the doctrine of fair use.{% endraw %}
