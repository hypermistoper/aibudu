{% raw %}Don’t invest in ANY rental properties in Singapore until you watch this video. In today’s episode, I’ll share with you why investing in a condominium is a terrible idea or dare I say, the WORST investment decision you can make. I’ll also analyze a real listing and go through the numbers step by step. Follow me on Instagram: MoneywithEumi <br /><br />The 4 main factors affecting value of properties in Singapore are:<br /><br />1. Public/Private property<br />2. Location<br />3. Tenure <br />4. Age<br /><br />In my opinion, capital appreciation should not be used as a strategy when you’re buying real estate as an investment in Singapore but it should only be looked at as a bonus…when you’re projecting your future profits. If it appreciates in the future… that’s great - it adds on to your return on investment (ROI). But if not, cashflow is key in real estate investing and building wealth. Or at the very least… you breakeven after all costs are factored so your tenant is paying your loan for you and you are growing equity that way.<br /><br />However, if you're buying condominiums as your primary residence and the high maintenance fee doesn't matter to you and you can afford it, by all means... please support the Singapore economy!<br /><br />► Get Up to 3 FREE Apple stock from Moomoo: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://moomoo.com/en-sg/act/welcome?channel=1002&amp;subchannel=467">https://moomoo.com/en-sg/act/welcome?channel=1002&amp;subchannel=467</a> <br /><br />► Get your FREE stock from Tiger: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tigerbrokers.com.sg/activity/forapp/welcome/?lang=en_US&amp;invite=MONEYWITHE">https://www.tigerbrokers.com.sg/activity/forapp/welcome/?lang=en_US&amp;invite=MONEYWITHE</a> <br /><br />► Get 50% off StashAway fee for 6 months up (up to the first $50,000 invested): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.stashaway.sg/ref/money-with-eumi-a31d5725-4821-4fd9-ba33-12de762561fb">https://www.stashaway.sg/ref/money-with-eumi-a31d5725-4821-4fd9-ba33-12de762561fb</a> <br /><br />► Follow Me on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/moneywitheumi">https://www.instagram.com/moneywitheumi</a> <br /><br />Watch Understanding Singapore Real Estate, Explained for Newbies: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/uP6pABgo4F0">https://youtu.be/uP6pABgo4F0</a><br /><br />Watch What Property to Buy in Singapore?
