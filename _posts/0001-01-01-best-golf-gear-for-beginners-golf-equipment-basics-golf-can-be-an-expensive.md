{% raw %}Golf can be an expensive sport to get into but in this video I cover the gear and equipment basics for building your golf bag. I cover the must haves of a golf bag and what's required by golf courses. As well as a few additional items for the golfer who may want a little more in their bag. As an average golfer I strive to keep my golf game affordable as it is easy to spend boatloads of money on golf gear. This video will help you decide what is worth your hard-earned money.   Thanks for Watching! <br /><br />Surgoal RS - 650 Rangefinder Review:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/a8U1jk6Wwug">https://youtu.be/a8U1jk6Wwug</a><br /><br /><br />Rough Golf is a channel for the average golfer looking to better their golf game or at least have a good laugh. The channel has How to videos, course vlogs, challenges, and equipment reviews. I will offer tips and tricks to help keep your golf game affordable. <br /><br />I plan to review older golf clubs and equipment to show how the older clubs still have plenty of play left in them and how having the latest and greatest isn't always the answer to a better golf game. <br /><br />I will do videos explaining golf terminology as well as golf etiquette. The ins and outs of a golf course and what to expect when you visit different courses. <br /><br />If you enjoy the channel make sure you hit the subscribe button and notification bell so that you stay current on any and all new channel content.{% endraw %}
