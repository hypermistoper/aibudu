{% raw %}The Australian’s Jennifer Oriel says if Russia and China “collude” in making an alternative to the SWIFT international payment system, we are in “very, very deep trouble”.<br /><br />Ms Oriel said the SWIFT payment system &quot;facilitates the supremacy of the US dollar&quot; and gives America and its allies the power to unite and fight with sanctions &quot;against despotic regimes&quot;.<br /><br />Russian banks have announced they would investigate issuing cards using payment systems like China’s UnionPay after Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc. suspended services in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine.{% endraw %}
