{% raw %}In this video I test out a cheap bender that does not suck. ($210AUD inc shipping)Usually cheap benders will just kink the pipe and produce misshaped bends but this one actually works really well as it created a nice curve with minimal marking on the work piece, this complete bender with 7 die sets only cost half the price of a Jd2 or Speedwerx single size die set.I got this to do all the smaller sizes from 25mm down to 10mm and I plan on getting a Speedwerx bender as well to do the larger sizes.I am really happy with it and can recommend this bender I just wish there was an Australian made version.<br /><br /><br />To get your own bender go onto your local ebay and search<br />&quot;10-25mm Manual pipe tube bender set&quot;<br /><br />and find a good price I payed $210 AUD in US ebay they where around $160 USD and in UK ebay they where as low as Â£80 but some of the listings in Australia now are $511 so see what you can find <br /><br />and then CUSTOMIZE EVERYTHING<br /><br /><br /><br />follow on social media at <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/juscozcustoms">https://www.facebook.com/juscozcustoms</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/juscozcustoms">https://www.instagram.com/juscozcustoms</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/juscoz">https://twitter.com/juscoz</a><br /><br /><br />Track: Last Heroes - Dimensions [NCS Release] <br />Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds. <br />Watch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ZPuvoDZj2hM">https://youtu.be/ZPuvoDZj2hM</a> <br />Free Download / Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ncs.io/DimensionsYO">http://ncs.io/DimensionsYO</a>{% endraw %}
