Four Dos and Don’ts of Additional Work as a Part-time Building Superintendent:<br /><br />Part-time Building Supers are often seen as the &quot;one-stop&quot; shop and the main &quot;go-to&quot; person for getting repair work and other odds-and-ends done at a building. <br />It can be a perfect match for the Part-time Super, who may be looking to make additional income at his building, and also for the residents, who need someone they can trust and rely on for such work.<br />But, it comes with a caveat: doing this the wrong way can hurt your reputation and trust that you built up, not to mention your pride and wallet!  <br /> <br />In this episode, we describe the four dos and don'ts of additional work as a part-time super work.

Be flexible.<br /> <br /><br />I also describe some types of additional work you can usually take on as a Part-time Super and earn you a rewarding income.<br /> <br />Follow this as your basic road to success as a Part-time Super!<br /><br /><br />More episodes to come on Career Talk for Part-time Building Supers<br /><br /><br />👉👉Subscribe to our Podcast &amp; YouTube! <br /><br /><br />☀️ 🎧 🌇 Apple Podcast / PodBean: Good Morning Super (by James Park) 🎧☀️🌇 <br /><br /> www.GoodMorningSuper.com <br /><br /><br />👉👉New Podcast episodes every week! <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />🚀Are you a Super in NYC?
