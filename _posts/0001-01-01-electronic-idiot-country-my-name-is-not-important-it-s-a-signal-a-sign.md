{% raw %}My name is not important, it's a signal, a sign<br />It means I'm doing what I do because I do it all the time<br />I get a lot of fun emotion, I get none if I use ya<br />I would crawl across the ocean so I could not abuse ya<br /><br />My life's deteriorating at a quarter to eight<br />Because I wrote myself a letter and I mailed it too late<br />I got a knock on the door, I got a nail on the floor<br />I got a nail in my head, but it don't hurt me no more<br /><br />It's an open act of defiance, and it's aimed DIRECTLY AT YOU<br />We could form some kind of alliance, we could do what we wanted to do<br />And the young would live forever<br />And the sun would shine through the blue<br />If we got our hands on this nation, we could do what we wanted to do<br /><br />With all the time I'm sweatin' I've got you on my mind<br />You're gonna lead me into trouble, you will leave me behind<br />Well I am not coming to ya, I'll only confuse ya<br />There's a label on you, I'm gonna rip it in two{% endraw %}
