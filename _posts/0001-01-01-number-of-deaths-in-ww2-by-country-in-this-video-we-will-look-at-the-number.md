{% raw %}In this video, we will look at the number of fatalities during the Second World War from 1939 to 1945. The war involved the vast majority of the world's countries—including all of the great powers—forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. In a total war directly involving more than 100 million personnel from more than 30 countries, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role in the conflict, enabling the strategic bombing of population centers and the only two uses of nuclear weapons in war. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in human history; it resulted in 70 to 85 million fatalities, a majority being civilians. Tens of millions of people died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.<br /><br />Sources: <br />nationalww2museum.org &amp; Wikipedia<br /><br />Subscribe here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEQSUZmwjiszLKoxgxeuVAw?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEQSUZmwjiszLKoxgxeuVAw?sub_confirmation=1</a>{% endraw %}
