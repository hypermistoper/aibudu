{% raw %}Trying to make an internal affairs complaint and the LT just wants to intimidate, argue and not take the complaint until I force the issue.  Knows why the cops took the sign down for the pedestrian crosswalk entrapment investigation but his ego won’t let him tel me.  Great deescalation training…. Why do we not have paperwork in the patrol cars for internal affairs complaints?  His officers don’t stop at stop signs, don’t carry identification as required by their own policy, don’t wear seat belts, don’t enforce the law…. Great disconnect!{% endraw %}
