{% raw %}It's good to learn all kinds of English phrases. It's good to learn nice English phrases so that you can use them to say nice things. It's good to learn mean English phrases so that you can recognize and understand them when you read them or hear them. You should, however, never say these phrases. I'm sure you're just too nice of a person to do that.<br /><br />In this English lesson we'll look at phrases like: You'll never amount to anything! You suck! You're just like your father!<br /><br />We'll also look at mean questions like: Why can't you be more like your brother? or Why can't you be more like your cousin?<br /><br />All in all, these are great phrases to learn but not great phrases to use. I'm happy to help you learn them anyways!<br /><br />I hope you enjoyed this English lesson about phrases you should never use!<br /><br />âŒ› Remember:  Always watch the video three times.  Twice today with English subtitles on, and once tomorrow with the English subtitles off.  This will reinforce the English you have learned!<br /><br />--<br />âœ… This video was edited by Ember Productions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://audreyember.com">https://audreyember.com</a> Thanks Audrey!<br />--<br /><br /><br />âœ… Support Me and Get These Members Only Perks:<br />ðŸ˜€ðŸ’² If you would like to become a member of my channel here is the link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJJTxA36ZPNTJ1WFIByaeA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJJTxA36ZPNTJ1WFIByaeA/join</a><br /><br />Becoming a member at every level has these benefits and perks:<br />1) For 10 minutes during each live stream you will be able to participate in the &quot;Members Only&quot; chat.<br />2) A cool crown beside your name during live streams and when making comments on videos.<br />3) Your name in green during live stream lesson chat.<br />4) You will have access to a members only video each Wednesday called, &quot;Wednesdays with Bob&quot;.
