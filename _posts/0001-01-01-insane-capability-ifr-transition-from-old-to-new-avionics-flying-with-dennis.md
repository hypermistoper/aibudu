{% raw %}Flying with Dennis! Aviation Jedi Master and Longtime Mentor. <br />#IFR training with Garmin GTN 750, G3X Touch, GFC 500 Digital Autopilot.<br />Proudly associated with ForeFlight: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.foreflight.com/flightchops">https://www.foreflight.com/flightchops</a><br /><br />Having been working closely with Dennis for nearly a decade, I am proud to be able to recommend his services to anyone that wants to take their flying to the next level. <br /><br />Our relationship started when I was a rusty VFR pilot needing to get recurrent… that lead to Dennis introducing me to tail wheel flying which changed everything about where I was headed as an aviator.  Then came multi engine and IFR flying.  It’s been awesome to have Dennis as a mentor all these years.  <br /><br />Next Level Flight Training (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nlft.ca)">https://nlft.ca)</a> provides personalized and professional #flighttraining for serious #generalaviation pilots. We'll help you fly with more confidence and precision to get more out of your investment. Be a better, safer pilot with Next Level Flight Training.<br />The next episode will cover flying couple approaches, and executing a go around using automation, while continuing to share more tools from Dennis’ and Justin’s IFR flying tool bags.<br /><br />Huge thanks to all the Supporters on Patreon!  The raw / uncut flight with Justin is already available to supporters, and the Flight with Dennis will be released before the second part. <br />Productions like this wouldn't be possible without your help and ongoing support.<br /><br />Check out FlightChops’ on Patreon to find out how you can be part of it:  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/join/FlightChops/">https://www.patreon.com/join/FlightChops/</a><br /><br />Follow FlightChops on Twitter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/flightchops">https://twitter.com/flightchops</a><br /><br />Follow FlightChops on Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/flightchops/">https://www.instagram.com/flightchops/</a><br /><br />Follow FlightChops on Facebook:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/flightchops/">https://www.facebook.com/flightchops/</a><br /><br />FlightChops Sponsors &amp; Supporters:  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://flightchops.com/supporters/">https://flightchops.com/supporters/</a><br /><br />FLIGHT CHOPS DISCLAIMER:<br />I am a &quot;weekend warrior&quot; private pilot, I fly for fun with no intentions of going commercial. I have had my PPL for over 15 years, but still consider each flight a learning experience - I generally take detailed notes after each flight to remind myself what went well or what I could do to improve.... Having GoPro cameras to record flights like this is invaluable. I find these self analysis videos very helpful in my constant quest to improve, and am happy to share. Feedback is invited; however, please keep it positive.<br />Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.FlightChops.com/">https://www.FlightChops.com/</a> for behind-the-scenes content, epic giveaways and to search episodes by aircraft type!{% endraw %}
