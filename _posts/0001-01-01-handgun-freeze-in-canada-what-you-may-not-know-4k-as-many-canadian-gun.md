{% raw %}As many Canadian gun owners are aware, the government has tabled unfair changes to firearms regulations intended to make the buying, selling and transferring of handguns unlawful so that, once you pass on, your property can be confiscated and destroyed.<br /><br />There are, however, important exemptions to this proposed law you should be aware of if you own a handgun (or ever want to in the future).  This video takes a close look at what those exemptions are and who they apply to.<br /><br />For legal information related to gun ownership in Canada, check out the channel, &quot;Runkle Of The Bailey&quot; at:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RunkleOfTheBailey">https://www.youtube.com/c/RunkleOfTheBailey</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: My videos are strictly for documentary, educational, and entertainment purposes only.
