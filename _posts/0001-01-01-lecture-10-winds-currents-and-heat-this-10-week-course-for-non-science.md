{% raw %}This 10-week course for non-science majors focuses on a single problem: assessing the risk of human-caused climate change. The story ranges from physics to chemistry, biology, geology, fluid mechanics, and quantum mechanics, to economics and social sciences. The class will consider evidence from the distant past and projections into the distant future, keeping the human time scale of the next several centuries as the bottom line. The lectures follow a textbook, &quot;Global Warming, Understanding the Forecast,&quot; written for the course. <br /><br />For information about the textbook, interactive models, and more, visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://forecast.uchicago.edu/">http://forecast.uchicago.edu/</a><br /><br />âž¡ Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/UCHICAGOytSubscribe">http://bit.ly/UCHICAGOytSubscribe</a>   <br /><br />About #UChicago:<br />Since its founding in 1890, the University of Chicago has been a destination for rigorous inquiry and field-defining research.
