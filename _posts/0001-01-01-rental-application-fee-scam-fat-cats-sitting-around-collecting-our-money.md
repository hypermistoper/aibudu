{% raw %}Fat cats sitting around collecting our money with often times nothing given to us. The hope of being eligible for that new rental home diminishes with every application fee we are forced to pay. Many states don't have regulations governing how high of a fee we can be charged. Often times, many applicants are applying to the same rental. Leaving the applicants short on necessary funds while the fat cats are just getting fatter. If left unchecked, we stand to live in a hopeless society of rental application fee scams. Welcome to the wild west of rental application fees. Thank you for watching, I appreciate it.<br /><br />Chicago Apartment and Condo Leasing Team original video <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnqGGAkvbIw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnqGGAkvbIw</a><br /><br />WATE 6 On Your Side original video  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZZyHs2GHE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wZZyHs2GHE</a><br /><br />KTNV Channel 13 News Las Vegas original video <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RNZLQmHtH4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RNZLQmHtH4</a><br /><br />KIFI Local News 8 original video <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWgfKXIo708">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eWgfKXIo708</a>{% endraw %}
