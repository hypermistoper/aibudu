{% raw %}From the mind of Chris Benchetler comes TGR's latest short film collaboration with Flagship Independent. Improvisation is the silver thread that weaves this crew together. Just as the Grateful Dead did not ﬁt their music into an established category, this short ﬁlm ﬁnds a cast of some of the world’s best athletes on a spontaneous journey of skiing, snowboarding, surfing, and music, complete with a soundtrack comprised of only Grateful Dead music.<br /><br />Narrated by Hall of Fame basketball player and television sportscaster Bill Walton with music supervision by David Lemieux, audiovisual archivist and legacy manager for the Grateful Dead, Fire On The Mountain features some of action sports’ most legendary athletes: snowboarding’s Jeremy Jones, Danny Davis, Kimmy Fasani, surfing icon Rob Machado, and skiers Michelle Parker and Chris Benchetler. Captured over the course of the winter by cinematographer Tyler Hamlet with the help of Sweetgrass Productions, the visual journey features never seen before visual effects within nature and original artwork by Benchetler and Skye Walker.<br /><br />Music Soundtrack: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/FOTMspotify">http://bit.ly/FOTMspotify</a><br /><br />Follow Chris Benchetler: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/chrisbenchetler/">https://www.instagram.com/chrisbenchetler/</a><br />Follow The Grateful Dead: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gratefuldead/">https://www.instagram.com/gratefuldead/</a><br />Follow Tyler Hamlet: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tylerjhamlet">https://www.instagram.com/tylerjhamlet</a><br /><br />For more from Teton Gravity Research, follow us:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/tetongravity">https://instagram.com/tetongravity</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/tetongravity...">https://www.facebook.com/tetongravity...</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tetongravity">https://twitter.com/tetongravity</a><br />Tik Tok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vm.tiktok.com/Pw4E1Q/">http://vm.tiktok.com/Pw4E1Q/</a><br /><br />Shop the Dream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shop.tetongravity.com">http://shop.tetongravity.com</a><br /><br />#TGRlivethedream{% endraw %}
