{% raw %}Check out my Rust Servers - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://enardoservers.com/">https://enardoservers.com/</a><br /><br />Another Rust Admin Trolling video but in this one, I tricked players into thinking there was a hacker on my server but instead it was @Lucasbattle with my help as a Rust admin. We decided to troll the whole server by having full access to bases, teleporting, exploding trucks and chopping 100 trees in less than a second. Everyone featured in the video were chill about everything once they knew it was us, we did return and fix any damages done during the wipe<br /><br />My links:<br />Second Channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EnardoLIVE">https://www.youtube.com/c/EnardoLIVE</a><br />Shorts Channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EnardoSHORTS">https://www.youtube.com/c/EnardoSHORTS</a><br />Discord - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/enardo">https://discord.gg/enardo</a><br />Twitch - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/enardo">https://www.twitch.tv/enardo</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Enardoz">https://twitter.com/Enardoz</a><br />Music By - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/enardo">http://share.epidemicsound.com/enardo</a><br />Patreon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Enardo">https://www.patreon.com/Enardo</a><br />Merch - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://enardo.gg/">https://enardo.gg/</a><br /><br />The only aim in Rust is to survive. To do this you will need to overcome struggles such as hunger, thirst and cold. Build a fire. Build a shelter. Kill animals for meat. Protect yourself from other players, and kill them for meat. Create alliances with other players and form a town. Do whatever it takes to survive.<br /><br />Outro song - Osoku - Air Bed<br /><br />#Rust #PlayRust #trolling{% endraw %}
