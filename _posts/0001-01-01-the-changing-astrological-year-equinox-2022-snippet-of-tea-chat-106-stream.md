Currently there is a big problem of scammers and impersonators trying to sell things to unsuspecting viewers. Never will this channel attempt to establish communication with you on WhatsApp nor will it solicit a private reading from you in the comments of this video or in any other direct communication. Be vigilient and pay attention, you will easily be able to tell that it is not me communicating with you. <br />If you want to get in touch with this channel, there is an area on the channel in the about page where that can be done officially. This is the only way you should expect to have direct communication - and ensure that the email address or user name you communicate with is exact; IE, not containing extra underscores, spelling variation, or extra punctuation). Because of this current issue, I will not be communicating in DM's on Instagram or Twitter either - to narrow down any communication confusion. Stay aware and REPORT impersonators unfailingly! Thank You! -Sky{% endraw %}
