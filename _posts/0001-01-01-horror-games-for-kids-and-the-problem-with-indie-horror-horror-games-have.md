{% raw %}Horror games have been a mainstay genre in the games industry for a while now. With the availability of software to make games in the modern age, many people have started to develop many independent horror games for a potential wide range of people to enjoy, there is one problem with this though. Trends come and go every now and then, but one trend in the indie horror space that has been rising for more than half a decade now is creating your horror game to be marketable to kids. Ever since FNaF, you can start to see many games go along this path, (Hello Neighbor, Bendy and the Ink Machine, Poppy Playtime, etc.) What caused this to become popular? Was Five Nights at Freddy’s always doomed to create this trend? And if so, why has no other franchise been able to have the long staying power in the pop culture space like FNaF? This is an explanation of “Horror Games for Kids”. And personally, why I think the indie horror space has a problem currently. Enjoy!<br /><br />okay okay yes I know I accidently called unity and ue4 &quot;open source&quot; instead of free. These engines are not open source, I know this, I just misspoke and didn't notice.
