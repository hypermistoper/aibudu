{% raw %}You may have wondered how to say no to a not-so-great request from your boss. Here’s how.<br /><br /><br />Innovation Editor Christine Liu tries the one thing that’s seemingly ingrained in our workplace brains: saying no to your boss or co-worker. It’s hard no matter how you slice it, but a clean framework can take the emotion out of the statement and soften the blow. In this episode of Christine vs. Work,  Ruchika Tulshyan, an inclusion strategist and author of, “The Diversity Advantage” helps Christine out by presenting a formula and discussing why deflecting a workplace ask can be so difficult. <br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> <br />At Harvard Business Review, we believe in management.
