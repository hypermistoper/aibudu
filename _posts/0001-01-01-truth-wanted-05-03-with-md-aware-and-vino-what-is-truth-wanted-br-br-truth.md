{% raw %}WHAT IS TRUTH WANTED?<br /><br />Truth Wanted is a show about getting to the bottom of beliefs, whether it’s karma or Christ, Bigfoot or crystals. Truth Wanted would like to know how you know it’s true. Primarily hosted by ObjectivelyDan, Truth Wanted takes calls from the community (that means YOU!) and features new guests every week, emphasizing thorough conversations over name-calling and scoffing (most of the time). Truth Wanted focuses on how and why people believe what they believe, and how you can talk about beliefs in more effective ways. Join us for truth investigations and lively conversations every Friday at 7:00pm CT! <br /><br />Call the show!  6:30-8 PM CT at 1-512-991-9242<br />or call with your computer 💻 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tiny.cc/calltw">http://tiny.cc/calltw</a><br /><br />► Don't like ads?
