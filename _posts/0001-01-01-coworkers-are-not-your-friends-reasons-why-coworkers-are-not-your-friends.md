{% raw %}Coworkers Are NOT Your Friends - Understand Reasons Why Colleagues are NOT friends. So many of us make this same mistake of confusing colleagues for friends at some point. The truth is that there are no real friends at work! Yes, being professional means being open and friendly, but it doesn’t mean that everyone is your friend. Does that mean we can’t make friends at work? Not exactly! We might make friends in the workplace, but since the majority of us don’t know what are the boundaries that need to be set for a professional relationship,  our potential friendships eventually backfire. Even if we go to lunch with our colleagues, we exchange holiday greetings, we share fun moments together, this is very far from what a real friendship is about. Because if you take “work” out of the equation, you would probably never have to speak to them again.<br /><br />In this video I’ll share the reasons WHY coworkers are not your friends and stick with me till the end for 4 RULES on building healthy relationships with your co-workers, so these relationships won’t damage you in the long run!<br /><br />Years ago hearing “coworkers are not your friends” would have probably not been taken seriously by me. I was convinced that I was building friendships at work, it also seemed to make the work environment much more enjoyable. But can we really build friendships at work? We might, but that’s not what happens in the 99% of cases. Just like at school, university or work, all these are people brought together by circumstances. And it’s easy to confuse these circumstantial relationships with friendships. Especially if these lack any boundaries and if these seem convenient to both. At most, I would suggest using the term: “situational friends” to describe them. But don’t overestimate the importance of these “situational friendships”.<br /><br />&quot;Work Family&quot; is a LIE - Why Coworkers Are NOT Your Family - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iJJzL_I0X4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2iJJzL_I0X4</a><br />How To Spot A Toxic Boss - Signs Of A Bad Manager - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdwMj44wd90">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdwMj44wd90</a><br />Signs You Should Decline A Job Offer - The Hiring Process Red Flags: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUK_AK-YKtg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VUK_AK-YKtg</a><br />7 Signs You’re About To Get Fired - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7An8iOQbuto">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7An8iOQbuto</a><br />7 Signs You Should Quit Your Job - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz5sdGpsXxA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dz5sdGpsXxA</a><br />How to Deal With A Toxic Boss - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku4L3I-fkWU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ku4L3I-fkWU</a><br />5 Signs Of a Burnout At Work (Signs You Are Burnt Out) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu7qg1wfnrc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yu7qg1wfnrc</a><br />Interview Red Flags: Signs of a Toxic Work Environment - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKi4W90CmSw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKi4W90CmSw</a><br />Why Did You Leave Your Last Job?
