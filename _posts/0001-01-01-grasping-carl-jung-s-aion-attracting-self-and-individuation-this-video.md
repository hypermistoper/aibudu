{% raw %}This video is a bit numinous. Not only the material covered, but how it all came to be. I began with the Greek Philosophers, from Parmenides through Thales of Miletus. <br /><br />From there, I connected his ideas with Jung's chapter in Aion where an attraction from a specific magnet is discussed. The alchemist, the adept, was interested in a specific Echeneis fish because of its ability to attract to a vessel and have it come to a standstill. An allegory to the EGO - Self relationship.<br /><br />So, I covered the entire chapter in Aion where this fish is discussed. It is a powerful video on many topics, including the great work of individuation, Truth, prima materia, Logos &amp; Eros, archetypes, the philosophers stone, ancient Greek philosophy, shadow work, being &amp; becoming, and Oneness. <br /><br />Content Covered: Aion Ch. 11 - The Alchemical Interpretation of the Fish<br /><br />Let me know what you think in the comments!<br /><br />Spiritual Greek Philosophy (Translation by Juan and Maria Balboa)<br /><br />PLATO's Parmenides Translation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://archive.org/details/parmenides-balboa/parmenides-balboa-2020-07-11/">https://archive.org/details/parmenides-balboa/parmenides-balboa-2020-07-11/</a><br /><br />PLATO's Republic Translation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://archive.org/details/republic-balboa">https://archive.org/details/republic-balboa</a><br /><br />PLATO's Elements of Theology Translation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://archive.org/details/proclus-elements-balboa">https://archive.org/details/proclus-elements-balboa</a><br /><br />CHAPTERS<br />00:00 Introduction<br />04:46 Alchemical Fish Text<br />07:08 Chapter 11 in Aion<br />24:49 Thales Interlude<br />29:36 Chapter 11 Conclusion<br />51:47 Final Thoughts<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />#carljung #aion #oneness #self #individuation #shadowwork #collectiveunconscious #consciousness #psychology #alchemy #ego #greekphilosophy{% endraw %}
