I am winging my way through this new life in a new country. It’s exciting and terrifying all at the same time but for the most part I am enjoying every little bit of the journey. <br /><br />I am so excited to share in my adventures and hope you will fall in love with travel and the UK as much as I have. <br /><br />Be sure to subscribe to my YOUTUBE channel to catch all that I’m up to.{% endraw %}
