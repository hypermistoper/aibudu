{% raw %}I attempted to beat 12 games of Pokemon Leaf Green at the exact same time. By pairing controls to each game, I had to navigate 12 separate characters that didn't always want to cooperate. How long will this take me, or is it even possible? Watch the video to find out!<br /><br />This is not a Nuzlocke, as you will see through my many failed battles. My only goal was to beat the game as fast as possible.<br /><br />Hurdle Music: The Hunter by Audionautix is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/</a><br /><br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://audionautix.com/">http://audionautix.com/</a>{% endraw %}
