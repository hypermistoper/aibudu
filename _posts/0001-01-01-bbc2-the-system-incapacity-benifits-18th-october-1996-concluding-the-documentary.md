{% raw %}Concluding the documentary series exploring Britain's social security system. Incapacity.<br />Sickness benefit is a cornerstone of Britain's welfare state, but it costs 8 billion a year and is rising. To cut the budget, the DSS has decided to scrap the existing benefit and subject all claimants to a new incapacity test. The government hopes this will find that 250,000 claimants are actually fit for work and so save 2 billion from the budget.<br />This programme takes a look at how<br />DSS doctors in Glasgow attempt to distinguish claimants who are genuinely sick from those who are fit to work. William Hague and his tory colleagues look at ways to save money from the system.<br />Some old footage of Glasgow in here as well.<br /><br />Please checkout my other playlists, plenty of Interesting stuff on here <br />BBC Documentaries<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO0zLqH9gUeqwpGVDPJGtUMd_z3saVMAg">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO0zLqH9gUeqwpGVDPJGtUMd_z3saVMAg</a><br />Channel 4 Documentaries<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO0zLqH9gUerWB8QKYlANHs_t-vVsUu8v">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO0zLqH9gUerWB8QKYlANHs_t-vVsUu8v</a><br />ITV Documentaries<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbymk-mzH9o&amp;list=PLO0zLqH9gUeqrhovP29hJ_x1wPWnCsZYF">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbymk-mzH9o&amp;list=PLO0zLqH9gUeqrhovP29hJ_x1wPWnCsZYF</a><br />Various Documentaries<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO0zLqH9gUerzzHvuGsr3qGf_S7sjOAK3">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO0zLqH9gUerzzHvuGsr3qGf_S7sjOAK3</a><br />News<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO0zLqH9gUept7MiGUY_PKJViaTz6Xx3N">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLO0zLqH9gUept7MiGUY_PKJViaTz6Xx3N</a><br />Many other playlists below <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs3UraX9MP-tykVVyPjH47w/playlists?view=1&amp;flow=grid">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs3UraX9MP-tykVVyPjH47w/playlists?view=1&amp;flow=grid</a><br /><br />Want to buy me a coffee to help with producing then you can below!
