{% raw %}Prices of just about everything are going up all over the world. Someone asked me how I am going to cope with this. I can't give financial advice, all I can do is talk about how I deal with it. Money saving is down to the individual, people have to make their own choices about what is important to them. I can't say what you need to do. Martin Lewis at Money Saving Expert would be a good place to get some tips. <br /><br />Keep a diary of every penny you spend and what you spent it on. Then work out if you actually needed the things you bought. That would be a good start.{% endraw %}
