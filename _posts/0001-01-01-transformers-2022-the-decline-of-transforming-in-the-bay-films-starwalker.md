What's going on guys? RBG here bringing you another Transformers video. And something that's been on my mind since the live action filmography has expanded to what it is today is the art of Transforming or in laments term, converting. And today we're gonna talk about how that concept has declined with each installment of the live action filmverse. One of the most exciting aspects of the Transformers brand is watching the characters transform from vehicles to robots and vice-versa. Translating the transformation sequences into live-action was something the films absolutely had to get right. I remember wondering how Michael Bay and Paramount were even gonna be able to achieve what seemed to be an impossible feat when the film was first announced.<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:18 The Art of Transforming<br />1:52 Translating to Live Action<br />3:23 Transformers 07 Crowd Reaction<br />4:48 How the CGI was created<br />5:06 A lot of time spent<br />5:58 How many pieces per model<br />6:52 A lot of emphasis put on transforming<br />7:29 When the quality dropped<br />8:08 No more transformation sequences<br />13:13 Conclusion<br /><br />#transformers{% endraw %}
