Throughout the video, i explain why Dubai was designed so terribly, and the new, Dubai 2040 Plan that hopes to fix this whole mess.<br /><br />The 2040 Plan is an incredible plan to fix most of the infrastructure problems  Dubai is facing. The plan also hopes for Dubai's population to go from the current, 3.5 Million residents, to 6 Million residents by 2040.
