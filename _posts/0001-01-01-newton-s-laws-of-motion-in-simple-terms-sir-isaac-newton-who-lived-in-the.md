{% raw %}Sir Isaac Newton—who lived in the 1600’s developed 3 laws to describe all states of motion.<br />Law 1 or the law of Inertia states that matter wants to resist any change in motion.<br />A. If an object is at rest, it wants to stay at rest.<br />B. If an object in motion wants to stay in motion.<br />C. The more mass an object has, the greater the inertia it has. <br /><br />These dominoes will stay at rest forever unless an outside force acts on it like this push from someones hand<br />D.Let’s see this law in action After the player punts the ball, due to inertia, what does the ball want to keep doing? ___Go in motion_______________________________ Why doesn’t it? ______________<br />__Air friction gravity other forces act on it<br />In order for an object to change its motion, what must happen?<br /><br />Why is the car hard to push? <br />The car wants to stay at rest and has a larger mass than the man trying to push it.<br /><br />Law 2<br /><br />Based on these observations, Newton came up with a law to describe acceleration.<br />Newton’s 2nd Law: “The acceleration of an object depends on the force acting on it and the mass of the object<br /><br />There is an equation associated with this law:<br /><br />F= ma<br />Force = mass multiplied by acceleration<br /><br />Look at this golf swing<br />The golf club has a high rate of acceleration and strikes the golf ball with great force<br /><br />The hammer has a greater mass and acceleration than the piggy bank<br /><br />Law Three<br /><br />Newton’s 3rd Law of Motion --“For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction<br /><br />Look closely at this jellyfish swimming<br />He moves his body backward but moves forward because the water exerts a force in the opposite direction which moves the jellyfish forward<br /><br />Same with the skateboard<br />The foot is pushing backward but the skateboard is going forward{% endraw %}
