{% raw %}I followed a mother cat with bread in her mouth for a long time. The mother cat was very hungry. But she did not eat the food she was carrying. Because she was taking that food to her hungry puppies. Motherhood is sacred. I rewarded the mother cat for this holy act. When the hunger was over, a happy family picture was formed.<br /><br />It's not the wound you see in the kitten's mouth. What you see is soil. They tried to eat the land because of hunger. The kittens' mouths were cleaned.<br /><br />Greetings from Adorable Paws. There are many stray cats living in our country. We have a dream. We established this channel to make this dream come true.
