{% raw %}In this Science (Biology) video in Hindi for class 9th we explained the functions and properties of epidermis which is a type of plant tissues. This is a topic of Chapter 6 of science from NCERT.<br /><br />Epidermis is the protective outer layer of a plant.<br /><br />→ The entire surface of a plant has an outer covering epidermis.<br />→ The epidermis is usually made of a single layer of cells.<br />→ Most epidermal cells are relatively flat.<br />→ It gives protection against water loss, mechanical injury and invasion by parasitic fungi.<br />→ Cells of epidermal tissue form a continuous layer without intercellular spaces.<br />→ Epidermal cells on the aerial parts of the plant often secrete a waxy, water resistant chemical, known as cutin, on their outer surface.<br /><br />🔴 How do plants exchange gases with environment and transpire ?<br /><br />→ Small pores in epidermis in the leaves are necessary for exchanging gases with the atmosphere and transpiration. Theses pores are known as 𝑠𝑡𝑜𝑚𝑎𝑡𝑎.<br />→ Stomata are enclosed by two kidney-shaped cells called 𝑔𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑑 𝑐𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑠.<br /><br />🔴 In plants living in very dry habitats protection against water loss is critical. How do they handle that ?<br /><br />→These plants have 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑘 𝑒𝑝𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑟𝑚𝑖𝑠 with a 𝑡ℎ𝑖𝑐𝑘 𝑐𝑜𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑜𝑓 𝒄𝒖𝒕𝒊𝒏 for protection against water loss.<br /><br />🔴 Epidermis is also found in roots. Function of roots is water absorption. Epidermal cells of the roots commonly bear long hair-like parts that increase the total absorptive surface area.<br /><br />🔴 What happens to the epidermis when plants grow old ?<br /><br />As plants grow older the secondary meristem located in the cortex forms layers of cells which constitute the 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑘. Cells of cork are dead and compactly arranged without intercellular spaces. They also have a substance called 𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑛 in their walls that makes them impervious to gases and water.<br /><br /><br />👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇<br /><br />🔴 Click here to watch the whole playlist on Chapter 6 : 'Tissues' for Class 9 :<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2wvd6i64AE&amp;list=PL51pHkbQg-terH21OElmUMe28hkk8rnwz">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2wvd6i64AE&amp;list=PL51pHkbQg-terH21OElmUMe28hkk8rnwz</a><br /><br />👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇<br /><br /><br />Previous videos -<br /><br />🔴 Tissues (Introduction)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/F2wvd6i64AE">https://youtu.be/F2wvd6i64AE</a><br /><br />🔴 Meristematic Tissue<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/teqnkAOTORA">https://youtu.be/teqnkAOTORA</a><br /><br />🔴 Simple Permanent Tissue<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/SyDszyiihbY">https://youtu.be/SyDszyiihbY</a><br /><br />**************************************{% endraw %}
