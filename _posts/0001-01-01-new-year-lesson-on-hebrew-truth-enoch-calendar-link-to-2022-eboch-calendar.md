For this reason the years will come upon them when they will disturb the order, and make an abominable day the day of testimony, and an unclean day a feast day, and they will confound all the days, the holy with the unclean, and the unclean day with the holy; for they will go wrong as to the months and Shabbathoth and feasts and jubilees. For this reason I command and testify to you that you may testify to them; for after your death your children will disturb them, so that they will not make the year three hundred and sixty four days only, and for this reason they will go wrong as to the New Moons and seasons and Shabbathoth and feasts, and they will eat all kinds of blood with all kinds of flesh.{% endraw %}
