{% raw %}In a very special series of films - Julie goes in search of the lost family ancestral home - Hinchingbrooke House in Cambridgeshire, in the East of England. As Viscountess Hinchingbrooke, Julie is fascinated by the history of house - from its monastic roots to royal visits and nearly 350 years of family history. After the Second World War, like so many other historic homes, the upkeep of the building was too great and the family had to leave Hinchingbrooke.  In this first episode, Julie’s father-in-law, the 11th Earl of Sandwich revisits his early childhood at Hinchingbrooke, showing Julie some of the photographic archive and rare family films of life there in the mid-twentieth century.<br /><br />Please help the production of future American Viscountess episodes and vlogs by becoming a patron at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/americanviscountess">https://www.patreon.com/americanviscountess</a><br /><br />American Viscountess is co-produced with Aonia.com (aonia_culture on Instagram and <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.Aonia.com)">https://www.Aonia.com)</a> art and culture online courses, lectures and more and made in association with Historic Houses (@historic_houses on Instagram and <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://historichouses.org">https://historichouses.org</a> website) - the  UK’s largest collection of Independently owned historic houses and gardens.
