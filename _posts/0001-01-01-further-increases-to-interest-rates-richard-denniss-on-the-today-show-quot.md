{% raw %}&quot;Previously the Reserve Bank had said it wouldn't increase interest rates until wages started to rise. That's clearly not happening. We're seeing the interest rates go up now and wages are yet to rise. So we are going to need to see some willingness from employers to pay more, otherwise governments and the Fair Work Commission are going to have to step in and push things along.{% endraw %}
