{% raw %}This encounter between a hot air balloon and a high-voltage wire goes about the way you'd expect.<br /><br /><br />&quot;On 7 January 2012, a scenic hot air balloon flight from Carterton, New Zealand, collided with a high-voltage power line while attempting to land, causing it to catch fire, disintegrate and crash just north of the town, killing all eleven people on board.<br />An inquiry into the accident by the Transport Accident Investigation Commission (TAIC) concluded that the balloon pilot had made an error of judgement when contact with the power lines became imminent, trying to outclimb the power lines rather than using the rapid descent system to drop the balloon quickly to the ground below. Toxicology analysis of the balloon pilot, Lance Hopping, after the accident tested positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), suggesting he may have been under the influence of cannabis at the time of the crash, which ultimately led to the error in judgement. The crash was the sixth transport accident in ten years the TAIC had investigated which involved key people testing positive for drugs or alcohol, and the commission has called for the government to enact stricter measures in regards to drug and alcohol use in the aviation, marine and rail industries.<br />The crash is the deadliest ballooning disaster ever to occur in New Zealand. It was also the deadliest air disaster to occur in mainland New Zealand since the 1963 crash of New Zealand National Airways Corporation Flight 441, and the deadliest crash involving a New Zealand aircraft since 1979 crash of Air New Zealand Flight 901 into Mount Erebus.&quot;<br /><br />More on Wikipedia: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Carterton_hot_air_balloon_crash">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Carterton_hot_air_balloon_crash</a><br /><br />Join membership: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGHDQtN_vzFYJaq_Fx1eikg/join</a><br />Second Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt93hxFmjppL5nLRAX94UrA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCt93hxFmjppL5nLRAX94UrA</a><br />Merch: teespring.com/stores/qxir<br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/qxir">https://www.patreon.com/qxir</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/QxirYT">https://twitter.com/QxirYT</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/jZzvvwJ">https://discord.gg/jZzvvwJ</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/qxiryt/">https://www.twitch.tv/qxiryt/</a><br />Subreddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Qxir/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Qxir/</a>{% endraw %}
