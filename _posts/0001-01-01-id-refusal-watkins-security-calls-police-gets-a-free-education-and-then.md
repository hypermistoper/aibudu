I was greeted By Watkins security wanting me to ID Myself to enter the building as they have tried before. They threw  fit and called the police. when the cop showed up and told them its perfectly legal for me to record and went to grab his phone the security guards started to call myself and the officer racist as were both white people. Luckily the officers supervisor is a black lady because they could no longer use that argument. My Camera got to hot and turned off for a little so i do apologize. I wont have it on that setting anymore. i didn't realize when i took it off the gimbal last week i had clicked a different mode. Becasue the guard kept calling me tekashi 69 i called him wack 100 and he got all butt hurt. told me to come up to the city and say that. i told him to come outside right now but of course all he could say was &quot;yeah, yeah, yeah&quot;<br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo6CEIbpEsPj5rWmAaS12bQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo6CEIbpEsPj5rWmAaS12bQ/join</a>{% endraw %}
