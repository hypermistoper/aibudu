Most masses that develop in the parotid gland are due to benign tumors such as a pleomorphic adenoma or a Warthin’s Tumor. Although non-cancerous, they do become larger over time and as such, are typically removed before it becomes disfiguring. More rarely, cancerous growths can also occur.<br /><br />When a parotid mass is removed, the surgeon can not simply remove the growth without taking into consideration where the facial nerve branches are.<br /><br />In order to minimize risk of accidentally cutting the facial nerve resulting in paralysis, the surgeon must first carefully identify all branches of the facial nerve around the mass using careful dissection. Afterwards, the mass, only at this point, can be removed safely and confidently.<br /><br />More information on parotid gland surgery:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.FauquierENT.net/parotidectomy.htm">https://www.FauquierENT.net/parotidectomy.htm</a><br /><br />Still haven’t subscribed to Fauquier ENT on YouTube? ►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/35SazwA">https://bit.ly/35SazwA</a><br /><br />#parotidectomy #parotidmass #parotidsurgery #facialnerve #facialparalysis{% endraw %}
