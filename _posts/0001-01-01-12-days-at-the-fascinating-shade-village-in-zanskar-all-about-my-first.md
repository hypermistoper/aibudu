{% raw %}All about my first visit to the Shade Village this winter. I went there on Jan 1st to celebrate their Losar Festival (Ladakhi New Year) and ended up having one of the best travel experiences of my life. <br /><br />This video would not have been possible without the help of my friend Norboo Tundup. Norboo was the one who gave me the idea of visiting Shade during their Losar festival. He not only took me to the village but also explained in great detail about the various traditions and customs followed by the people of Shade. My whole experience at Shade was enriched by his presence. Norboo runs a travel company called Kun Expeditions. Do get in touch with him if you want to go on similar adventures.<br /><br />Norboo Tundup : 9419344569, 6006949082<br /><br />00:00 Intro<br />00:48 Journey to Phukthar<br />01:48 Journey to Shade<br />04:47 Festivities at Shade<br />07:08 Village Life<br />07:57 Snowfall<br />08:35 Leaving Shade<br />10:10 Snow Hike to Phukthar<br /><br />****** <br />Soundtrack : Life's Sweetness by Patrick Ussher<br /><br />I usually license my tracks from Artlist.io.
