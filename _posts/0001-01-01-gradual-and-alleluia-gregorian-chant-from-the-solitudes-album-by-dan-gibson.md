{% raw %}God is not His creation, but His creation does give a testimony His glory. This video contains a collection of the wide array of natural wonders of the Earth, with the accompanying 'Great Praise' of the Alleluia. The beauty and richness of the world God created and formed truly surpasses any design of human formation. In its stillness and simplicity, God's creation truly is good. &quot;And God saw all the things that he had made, and they were very good.&quot; - Genesis 1:31. The chant is from the CD &quot;Illumination&quot; by Dan Gibson. <br />The lyrics, which are a collection of psalm excerpts, are as follows: <br /><br />Tecum principium in die virtutis tuæ in splendoribus sanctorum : ex utero, ante luciferum, genui te.<br />Dixit Dominus Domino meo : Sede a dextris meis, donec ponam inimicos tuos scabellum pedum tuorum. <br />Alleluia<br />Dominus dixit ad me : Filius meus es tu; ego hodie genui te. <br />AlleluiaSalvos fac nos, Domine, Deus noster, et congrega nos de nationibus: ut confiteamur nomini sancto tuo, et gloriemur in gloria tua.<br /> Tu, Domine, Pater noster, et Redemptor noster: a saeculo nomen tuum.<br />Alleluia<br />Laudem Domini loquetur os meum et benedicat omnis caro nomen sanctum ejus.<br />Tecum principium in die virtutis tuæ in splendoribus sanctorum : ex utero, ante luciferum, genui te.<br />Dixit Dominus Domino meo : Sede a dextris meis, donec ponam inimicos tuos scabellum pedum tuorum.<br />Alleluia <br /><br />The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.<br />With you is the principality in the day of your strength: in the brightness of the saints: from the womb before the day star I begot you.<br />Alleluia<br />The Lord has said to me: You are my son, this day have I begotten you.<br />Alleluia<br />Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations: that we may give thanks to Thy holy Name, and may glory in Thy praise. <br />Thou, O Lord, our Father and our Redeemer: from everlasting is Thy Name.<br />Alleluia<br />My mouth shall speak the praise of the Lord, and let all flesh bless His holy Name.<br />The Lord said to my Lord: Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.<br />With you is the principality in the day of your strength: in the brightness of the saints: from the womb before the day star I begot you.<br />Alleluia{% endraw %}
