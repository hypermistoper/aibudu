This is HDB, which is Indias #1 bank. This bank has seen tremendous growth over the years, and has grown every metric at a rate that far exceeds that of any North American bank. It is a more boring stock, but the returns and the growth speak for themselves.<br /><br />HDB is currently in quite the dip as well, and I have been using this as an opportunity to buy more shares. In this video, I explain my high level long term thesis and why I am a buyer in this range.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument. I will NEVER ask you to send me money to trade for you. Please report any suspicious emails or fake social media profiles claiming to be me. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose. There are no guarantees or certainties in trading or investing.<br /><br />My videos may contain affiliate links or sponsorship to products I believe will add value to your life and help you. No matter what I or anyone else says, itâ€™s important to do your own research before making a financial decision.<br /><br />See Full Disclaimer Here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.danielpronk.com/disclaimer">https://www.danielpronk.com/disclaimer</a>{% endraw %}
