{% raw %}All the comforting flavors and textures of lasagna but in only 25 minutes!  I'm not saying it's *better* but it's definitely faster and just as good as the original!<br /><br />Skillet Lasagna<br />Five in 25<br />Serves 4<br /><br />Five Ingredients<br />6-7 no boil lasagna noodles<br />4 cups (32 oz) marinara sauce<br />1 lb Italian sausage<br />1 cup (8 oz) shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese<br />½ cup ricotta cheese<br /><br />In a large skillet over medium heat add the sausage and cook, crumbling into small pieces.  Add the marinara sauce and rinse the jar out with ¼ cup of water and add that to the skillet.  Stir to combine.  Taste for seasoning and add salt and pepper if needed.<br /><br />Break the lasagna noodles into bite size pieces and add them to the skillet.  Stir to combine and ensure the sauce is covering the noodles.  Cover and reduce heat to medium low.  Cook for 15-20 minutes or until the noodles are al dente, stirring once or twice during cooking.  <br /><br />Add the mozzarella and ricotta and stir until it is just melted and incorporated.  Serve immediately garnished with more cheese and basil or parsley if desired.{% endraw %}
