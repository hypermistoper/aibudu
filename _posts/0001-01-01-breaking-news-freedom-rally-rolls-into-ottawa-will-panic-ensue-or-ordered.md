{% raw %}Freedom Rally Rolls Into Ottawa, Will Panic Ensue, Or Ordered Chaos?<br />12 noon-ish some call high-noon the Freedom Rally Convoy should be crossing the Rubicon (famous river in Rome, no army was permitted to cross, C... crossed that line...)  What will they do? there are reports of all sorts, though if they got the numbers right,  <br />$6 Million raised this is going to be a good day for the gas stations in Ottawa &amp; a rather large circle, jeese look at the thyme, the Germans have an expression, rather a compound word meaning at the edge of my seat... wie es einige der anderen G√§ste ausdr√ºcken w√ºrden or/oder gespannt wie ein Flitzebogen...  <br />All will be well as it is too cold for much else.  The MP's have been told to run for the hills, will any show up? Last time it was the lone Maxime Bernier, will it be so twice? Maybe the hotels will fill up for once in 2 years? <br />You are getting mostly silence from the media on this, with 40 000 trucks,  trice the size of my home town.  According to the Sarg at Arms down there the MP's should run to the hills, run for your life but any person in security worth their salt, says that at any sign of changing ground so... <br /><br /> There is more coming so stat tuned to this one as there may me an over reaction point... Or is this 6 million really just water thrown on the 300 ft. boulder? Only time will tell...<br />Leave your comments down below, please!<br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC59x_y5hrQT7NivanuJxwfA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC59x_y5hrQT7NivanuJxwfA/join</a><br />Donate &quot;Freedom of Speech Fund&quot; Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/safespacecafe">https://www.patreon.com/safespacecafe</a><br />www.safespace.ca<br /><br />Average Canadian's wishing to hear from all sides...<br />Research: Nicky Mephistopheles <br /><br />Canadian Politics are Discussed.

Beach combing on an August day, cause it bites the little one in December...  <br />In winter, is it in the evergreens with Blue Jays, Cardinals &amp; those little happy robber looking ones?<br />Perchance, in fall it is under a comfort'ing Mable with all the glory of what my Arabian friend calls Canadian Whiskey (Mable Syrup). <br />Or like some,  find their Safe Space is in the thick of it, when there is no time to discuss/congratulate, hold a meeting nor anything but the task at hand... <br />Where's your Safe Space?<br />#SafeSpaceCafe, #FreedomConvoy2022, #FreedomRally,{% endraw %}
