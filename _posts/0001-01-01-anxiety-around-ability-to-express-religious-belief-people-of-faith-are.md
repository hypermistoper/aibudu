{% raw %}People of faith are experiencing “anxiety” around their ability to express beliefs, according to GT Communications’ Gemma Tognini.<br /><br />“There is a level of anxiety amongst people of faith … about their ability to express that faith in various places – workplaces, education places – without suffering consequences,” Ms Tognini said. <br /><br />“I’d like to think most of us have the ability to hold two ideas in tension … but it seems that that’s a little bit challenging from time to time.”{% endraw %}
