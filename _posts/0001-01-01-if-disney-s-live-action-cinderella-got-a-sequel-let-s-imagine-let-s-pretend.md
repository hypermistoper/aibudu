{% raw %}LET'S PRETEND FOR A SEC. A sequel to the 2015 live-action adaptation of Disney's 1950 animated classic Cinderella (I've made one before but it's time for another). The remake stars Lily James as Cinderella, Richard Madden as Prince Charming/Kit, Cate Blanchett as Lady Tremaine, and Helena Bonham Carter as the Fairy Godmother, and is magical, enchanting, faithful to the original, and really needs a sequel. I really want a sequel. I'd also settle for a Disney Plus series (could be like Disney Plus's own Bridgerton or somethin').<br /><br />I talk more about why I want a sequel and what I'd like to see in one in this video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgo7FVqBQgc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cgo7FVqBQgc</a><br /><br />#disney #cinderella #trailer{% endraw %}
