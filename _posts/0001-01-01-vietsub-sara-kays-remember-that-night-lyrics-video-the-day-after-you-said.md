{% raw %}The day after you said goodbye<br />All I did was lay in bed and cry<br />But after one month, I started to move on<br />And after two, I felt alright<br />Then three months in, you were off my mind<br />And month four and five, I was living my life<br />I was better and didn't have to try<br />Not to think of you, 'til you reached out<br />And said, &quot;Remember that night?&quot;<br />We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning<br />I kissed you, it was pouring<br />We held each other tight before the night was over<br />You looked over your shoulder<br />Oh, I was doing fine<br />You said, &quot;Remember that night?<br />Remember that night?&quot;<br />Oh, I was doing fine<br />You said, &quot;Remember that night?<br />Remember that night?&quot;<br />The day after you had reached out<br />I was broken for the second time around<br />I prayed on the third day that I would be okay<br />That I'd forget you were ever mine<br />Oh, I don't think you realize<br />How long I had to fight to be living my life<br />To be better and never have to try<br />Not to think of you until you reached out<br />And said, &quot;Remember that night?&quot;<br />We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning<br />I kissed you, it was pouring<br />We held each other tight before the night was over<br />You looked over your shoulder<br />Oh, I was doing fine<br />You said, &quot;Remember that night?<br />Remember that night?&quot;<br />Oh, I was doing fine<br />You said, &quot;Remember that night?<br />Remember that night?&quot;<br />We went for a drive, 2:30 in the morning<br />I kissed you, it was pouring<br />We held each other tight before the night was over<br />You looked over your shoulder<br />Oh, I was doing fine<br />You said, &quot;Remember that night?<br />Remember that night?&quot;<br />Oh, I was doing fine<br />You said, &quot;Remember that night?<br />Remember that night?&quot;<br /><br />#Vietsub #SaraKays #rememberthatnight{% endraw %}
