{% raw %}Hello everyone I hope you are all doing ok? Tonight's video is a mini montage of our recent holiday to Northumberland. I didn't vlog it like I normally would but I caught some moments on my phone and thought I would share them with you all. We recently stopped at Parkdean Resorts Church Point Holiday Park in Newbiggin-by-the-sea in Northumberland, we had a really lovely time. Take care and I'll see you on the next one!<br /><br />⭐️ PREVIOUS VIDEO ⭐️ <br /><br />PARKDEAN CHURCH POINT HOLIDAY | CARAVAN TOUR &amp; REVIEW<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mp43oQ1Avd8">https://youtu.be/mp43oQ1Avd8</a><br /><br />⭐️ ABOUT ME ⭐️<br /><br />I’m a 31 year old mum of three! Ethan is 7, Edith is 4 and baby Margot was born in September 2021. I’m Yorkshire born and bred, I love it here it’s such a beautiful place. I met my husband back in 2008 and we married in 2012. I work part time and look after the tinies for the rest. I love Tea, Charity Shops, Cross Stitching and cheesy pop music. I hope you’ll stick around, it means so much to me! <br /><br />⭐️ FIND ME ⭐️ <br /><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/taylormademum">https://www.facebook.com/taylormademum</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/taylormademum">https://www.instagram.com/taylormademum</a><br /><br />Music from Youtube Audio Library &amp; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bensound.com/">https://www.bensound.com/</a><br /><br />⭐️ CONTACT ME ⭐️<br /><br />bumptaketwo@gmail.com<br /><br />#parkdeanresorts #holiday #northumberland{% endraw %}
