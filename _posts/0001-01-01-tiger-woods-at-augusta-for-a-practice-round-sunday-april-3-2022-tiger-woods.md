{% raw %}Tiger Woods arrived at Augusta National on Sunday to continue his preparation for the upcoming Masters, the clearest sign yet that he is nearing a return to competition just 14 months after sustaining traumatic injuries to his right leg in a single-car accident.<br /><br />He did, however, stop short of fully committing to playing in the year's first major.<br /><br />“I will be heading up to Augusta today to continue my preparation and practice,” Woods wrote on Twitter Sunday morning amid heavy speculation over his decision. &quot;It will be a game-time decision on whether I compete.&quot;<br /><br />Later on Sunday, Woods briefly showed up to the driving range, warming up before heading off to what is believed to be a practice round. The course is closed to the media on Sunday.<br /><br />Woods, 46, is a five-time Masters champion and 15-time major winner. He suffered comminuted open fractures to both the tibia and fibula bones in his right leg as well as extensive nerve and soft tissue damage when he lost control of an SUV outside Los Angeles in February 2021. He underwent multiple emergency procedures at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and additional surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center before beginning an extensive rehabilitation process at his home in South Florida.<br /><br />“I think something that is realistic is playing the tour one day—never full time, ever again—but pick and choose, just like Mr. [Ben] Hogan did,” Woods said. “Pick and choose a few events a year and you play around that.”{% endraw %}
