{% raw %}In this weeks episode we meet Bérangère, an inspiring young woman who amazingly built her very own tiny house during lockdown in France. Her spectacular home is named ‘La Belle Idée’, which translates to the beautiful idea. <br /><br />Bérangère was inspired to build her tiny home after spending four years traveling and realising she desired a place to call home. With minimal possessions and still wanting a place which would give her options for where she could live, she decided a tiny house would be the perfect home. <br /><br />Originally, she had intended to construct her home together with others as part of a tiny house building workshop, but lockdown in France put an end to the workshop after the first week and Bérangère was then left to complete the home on her own. <br /><br />The result is a beautiful and inspiring build. We hope you enjoy the video tour of this wonderful tiny house which absolutely lives up to it’s name! <br /><br />If you enjoy our show, please consider supporting us on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/livingbig">https://www.patreon.com/livingbig</a><br /><br />Find out more about this tiny house and others on our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.livingbiginatinyhouse.com/">https://www.livingbiginatinyhouse.com/</a><br /><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/livingbiginatinyhouse">https://www.instagram.com/livingbiginatinyhouse</a><br /><br />Follow us on Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/livingbiginatinyhouse">http://www.facebook.com/livingbiginatinyhouse</a><br /><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tinyhousenz">https://twitter.com/tinyhousenz</a><br /><br />Please subscribe for more videos on tiny houses, architecture, DIY, design, and sustainable, off-grid living.<br /><br />Title music in this video by Bryce Langston: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/brycelangston">http://www.youtube.com/brycelangston</a><br /><br />Presented and Produced by: Bryce Langston<br />Filmed &amp; Edited bv: Gabrielle Vnd<br /><br />'Living Big in a Tiny House' © 2022 Zyia Pictures Ltd<br /><br />#tinyhouse #architecture #alternativeliving{% endraw %}
