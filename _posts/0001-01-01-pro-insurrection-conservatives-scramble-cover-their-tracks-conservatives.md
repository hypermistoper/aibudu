Think about it, more than 60 million Americans voted for one of the most corrupt politicians in American history, whose son is doing deals with communist China.<br /><br />We just need the evidence. We need the paper trail. We need the judges to enforce the rule of law, and if the local bureaucrats prevent us from seeing the evidence, from seeing the legitimate votes, we need the U.S. Marshals to deploy and they need to break down the doors of those polling stations and stop the crimes being committed. It is that simple.&quot;<br /><br />#TheDamageReport #JohnIadarola #TheYoungTurks{% endraw %}
