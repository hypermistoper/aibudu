{% raw %}According to the World Resources Report, in order to feed 10 billion people by 2050, with the same level of food production, most of the worldâ€™s forests must be deforested. Another way out, experts say, is the urgent creation of a more efficient agricultural system that will help solve the impending problem of world hunger. The Netherlands, a small country that has been able to rank second in the world in terms of agricultural food export, is a worthy example to follow. But how exactly did they manage to achieve this result?  The simplest way to increase yields is to increase the use of various soil fertilizers and pest control chemicals. Although this helps to increase yields in the short term, however, such methods require a constant increase in the dosage volume, which leads to soil degradation and its inability to grow anything except for a few crops, and then to desertification. Due to various weather conditions and terrain features, the degree of soil degradation can either accelerate or slow down, but the result will still be the same. <br /><br />#inventions  #technology #agriculture<br /><br />If you are the author of the materials or the copyright owner of it, but your authorship was not indicated or you object to its use,  please contact me: titosaleksyt@gmail.com<br /><br />Donâ€™t miss next videos: Press the little bell ((ðŸ””)) to get notifications<br /><br /><br />Production Music courtesy of Epidemic Sound <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a>{% endraw %}
