{% raw %}Hi Everyone! In video, I am sharing some ideas for a calming evening routine. I love the night time and I've always been a night owl. Something about the darkness and quiet is quite inspiring. I always make sure to take the time in the evenings to enjoy my alone time, do the things I love and recharge for the next day. I hope you enjoy!<br /><br />Book in the Video<br />The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MUcviG">https://amzn.to/2MUcviG</a><br /><br /><br />-C O M E  S A Y  H I-<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/malamalife/">https://www.instagram.com/malamalife/</a><br /><br />-I N Q U I R I E S-<br />sophie.malamalife@gmail.com<br /><br />-M U S I C-<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/iw5a6z/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/iw5a6z/</a><br /><br />-C A M E R A  G E A R-<br />Main Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/30fW97P">https://amzn.to/30fW97P</a><br />Second Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2HuU8y7">https://amzn.to/2HuU8y7</a><br />Filming Lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2S6V6CT">https://amzn.to/2S6V6CT</a><br />SD card: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3cCWeHT">https://amzn.to/3cCWeHT</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Links included in this description may be affiliate links.
