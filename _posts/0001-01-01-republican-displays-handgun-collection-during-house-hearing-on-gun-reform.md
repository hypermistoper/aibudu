{% raw %}A Republican congressman used a House hearing on gun control in the aftermath of multiple mass shootings in the US to show off his own collection of guns and brandish them via remote video link. Greg Steube, a representative from Florida, displayed a succession of firearms he says would be banned under a bill being debated in response to the shootings. 'Here’s a gun I carry every single day to protect myself, my family, my wife, my home,' he said while holding a firearm. When Sheila Jackson Lee, a Democrat from Texas, interjected and said she hoped the gun was not loaded, Steube replied: 'I’m in my house, I can do whatever I want with my guns'.{% endraw %}
