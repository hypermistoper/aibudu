{% raw %}Locker Nuts episode 550<br /><br />In the last episode, we were carving a path to the back of this massive 12' x 30' locker to see what goodies are hiding back there. This video picks up where that one left off (after a coffee break) and I continue the treasure hunt. One item surprises me in particular, as it's the second one I've found recently, and I'm really happy about it!<br />This is episode 22 of the &quot;Million Dollar Train Locker&quot;<br /><br />Email: lockernuts@gmail.com<br />Mailing address: 12935 Alcosta Blvd. unit 3761, San Ramon, CA 94583<br />eBay Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://stores.ebay.com/gatodeal">http://stores.ebay.com/gatodeal</a><br />***Please don't message me through the eBay store<br /><br />Â©2022 JRC &amp; Associates, Inc.
