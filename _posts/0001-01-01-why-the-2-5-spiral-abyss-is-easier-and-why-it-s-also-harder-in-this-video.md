{% raw %}In this video, I talk about a few of my first impression on the 2.5 abyss. I talk about the reasoning for why this abyss can be easy and why it can also be hard. As always, the answer in genshin impact is always it depends. And with the trend that Hoyoverse has set with their design choices in abyss. The generalized good abyss for everyone is slowly becoming a relic of the past. I analyze a few things and tell you why this abyss is easy for some and hard for others. Let me know down in the comments if you agree with them or not! I'm always open to new ideas!<br /><br />i'm a slime and i stream over at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/dojimaman">https://www.twitch.tv/dojimaman</a> Come at the slime king!<br /><br />-Content of the video-<br />0:00 - Context of 2.5 abyss discussion<br />0:32 - Thoughts of abyss as a Geo Main<br />1:35 - My perspective coming into this Abyss<br />2:24 - Why this Abyss is Easier<br />3:27 - How I view Abyss<br />4:55 - Why this Abyss is Harder<br />7:50 - Hoyoverse's Design Choices{% endraw %}
