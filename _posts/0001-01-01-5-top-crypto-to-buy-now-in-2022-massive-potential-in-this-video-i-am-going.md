The last few weeks were especially tough in the markets and we did see a lot of corrections. However, crypto and blockchain are seriously cool technologies that really deserve the spotlight, and it has been very exciting riding the waves over the last few years. The coins on this list are all spectacular projects that have a lot of great uses or are icons in the crypto world. Holding them long term should be a good bet - however in the short term they can always go up or down significantly. There is definitely a chance these continue dropping but for the long term I am very bullish. I’ll be DCA (dollar cost averaging) which is what most investors do.<br /><br />With any type of investing, I recommend you do your own due diligence before investing. Just because a coin was on this list does not mean you should blindly invest in it - that would be foolish. These are my opinions and you should create your own using this video as a reference guide only - this video should not be taken as financial advice.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy this video and happy crypto trading!<br /><br />-Charlie<br /><br />#TOPCRYPTO #PICKS #JANUARY<br /><br />Wealthfront Historical Returns:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wealthfront.com/historical-performance">https://www.wealthfront.com/historical-performance</a><br /><br />Charlie Chang receives cash compensation from Wealthfront Advisers LLC (“Wealthfront<br />Advisers”) for sponsored advertising materials.
