{% raw %}I thought it would be handy to have a small table for my cordless trim router. <br />Key design points:<br />- made entirely from scrap wood, plywood mostly<br />- fast and easy to put the router in and take it out again<br />- a convenient way to clamp it down to my work bench<br />- a proper fence with movable faces to close the gap around the bit<br />- use a base plate for the router that can stay on the router<br />Time will tell how often I use this table. Making it more convenient to use for small things than my big router table will go a long way. <br /><br />▶️ Project plans for sale: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ibuildit.ca/plans/">https://ibuildit.ca/plans/</a><br />▶️Support the work I do on Locals:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ibuildit.locals.com/">https://ibuildit.locals.com/</a><br />▶️ Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=865843&amp;ty=h">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=865843&amp;ty=h</a><br />▶️ Join my Makers Mob for detailed build tutorials:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.themakersmob.com/john-heisz-i-build-it/?via=ibuildit">https://go.themakersmob.com/john-heisz-i-build-it/?via=ibuildit</a><br /><br />My &quot;Scrap bin&quot; channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/IBuildItScrapBin">https://www.youtube.com/c/IBuildItScrapBin</a><br /><br />#ibuildit<br />#woodworking<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ibuildit.ca/">https://ibuildit.ca/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/I-Build-It-258048014240900/">https://www.facebook.com/I-Build-It-258048014240900/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/i_build_it.ca/">https://www.instagram.com/i_build_it.ca/</a>{% endraw %}
