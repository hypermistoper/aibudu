{% raw %}Have you seen the new U-shaped toddler's toothbrush? I have! It popped up on my Lazada dashboard. And I got curious. So I purchased one and this is what my toddler and I think about it.<br /><br />I really want my daughter to brush her teeth well especially now that the holiday festivities are starting! All these Christmas get-togethers and meals! Perfect time for her to be inspired to brush brush and brush!<br /><br />My 2.5 year old has been using this U-shaped toothbrush for the past 2 weeks now. The one I showed in this video is the manual type (which was a freebie). What I really bought was the electric u-shaped toothbrush. <br /><br />Since Mina has never tried using an electric toothbrush before, I figured it might be better if she tries the manual type first.<br /><br />If all goes well, I plan to transition her to the electric U-shaped toothbrush in another 2 weeks or so.<br /><br />I hope this helps you have an idea how the U-shaped toddler's toothbrush works for a 2.5 year old!<br /><br />Let's grow together!üå± = [Subscribe]üéà <br /><br />XOXO,<br />Mom &amp; Mina üç¶üç¶<br /><br />P.S.
