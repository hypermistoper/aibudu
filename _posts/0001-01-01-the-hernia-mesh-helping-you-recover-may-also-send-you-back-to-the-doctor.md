{% raw %}The hernia mesh helping you recover may also send you back to the doctorâ€¦<br /><br />Surgical mesh is often used during hernia surgery to help support weakened tissue. Surgical mesh can be made out of cow or pig tissue but many are made from synthetic materials. <br />The problem comes when the mesh causes serious medical complications. Patients who experience these often need to get more surgery to correct the issue. Lawsuits have already been filed against Ethicon for its Physiomesh flexible composite hernia mesh. Surgical mesh from other companies has allegedly caused serious side effects too.Complications from surgical mesh include perforated intestines or bowel, peritonitis, bowel obstruction, sepsis, or abscess.<br /><br />If you needed revision surgery because of the side effects of hernia mesh, contact us for a free legal consultation 888 - 987-1307<br /><br />More Info: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.classaction.com/hernia-mesh/">https://www.classaction.com/hernia-mesh/</a>{% endraw %}
