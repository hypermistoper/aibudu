(Thursday, February 24, 2022) — Many Dollywood Parks &amp; Resorts guests ask what happens during the winter months at the popular Pigeon Forge destination. For many employees across the company’s properties, the “off season” is anything but time off. With several projects occurring simultaneously this winter, a number of new sights will greet guests when the park opens to all season passholders March 11 for Season Passholder Day and March 12 for the general public.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Yesterday, members of the media toured Dollywood, Dollywood’s Splash Country and the newest property in the company’s portfolio, the under-construction Dollywood’s HeartSong Lodge &amp; Resort. Eugene Naughton, The Dollywood Company President, led the tour and explained why the projects are crucial to maintaining the company’s growing reputation as a top national destination.<br /><br /> <br /><br />“As the stature of Dollywood—and our area in general—continues to increase, our guests’ expectations elevate also,” said Naughton. “Last off season, we completed several projects that were designed to enhance the guest experience to a greater level. Additionally, we identified several other projects that we were able to complete during the 2021 operating season, like the reconstruction of Hickory House BBQ to maximize efficiencies and decrease wait times.<br /><br /> <br /><br />“We selected a number of projects for this off season that we felt were crucial for the guest experience and for park infrastructure in general. Guests will start to notice the changes as soon as they drive onto the property. We’ve reconfigured our parking complex to better utilize the lots at both Dollywood and Dollywood’s Splash Country to provide a more efficient experience for guests as they enter our property.”<br /><br /> <br /><br />The principal change guests will see is the swapping of the guest traffic lanes with the tram lanes, which removes previous points of intersection between the two. The multi-property parking complex now employs a one-way circuit which eliminates the two-way traffic pattern of the old parking lot layout. Also, the addition of two extra parking toll booths (four attendants), as well as more staging lanes for the toll booths, will result in a reduction of time spent waiting to enter the property.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Other projects throughout the Dollywood theme park property include the renovation of Iron Horse Pizza (formerly known as Victoria’s Pizza) to include greater production capacity and more seating space for guests. The Emporium also receives a complete makeover, providing a modern shopping experience as guests look to find unique Dollywood keepsakes.<br /><br /> <br /><br />As guests have continued to ask for more room to provide spacing in the park, two buildings have been removed to allow for wider walkways —the former Eagle Shop (part of the second phase of the Craftsman’s Valley widening project) and the former Christmas Cottage in Rivertown Junction. Additionally, the tunnel connecting lower Craftsman’s Valley to The Village has been removed, with the final result providing guests a location to spread out—perhaps while enjoying a loaf of cinnamon bread from the nearby Grist Mill—and have an up-close and unobstructed view of the Dollywood Express as it passes by.<br /><br /> <br /><br />“As our park continues to expand, we must regularly address the areas of the park that have been here longer,” Naughton explained. “We put much thought into every project we undertake, considering guest appeal, current practicality and future lifespan to determine what takes precedence. We know the mine tunnel was a popular landmark for guests, but its removal was necessary at this time. We feel the new widened pathway will offer a great place to watch the Dollywood Express—which is one of our most popular attractions—as it leaves and returns to The Village. I hope we’ll have generations of guests who make fond memories in this area.”{% endraw %}
