Incision is made posteriorly, from L4 to S1 vertebral spines. Laminectomies are performed along with removal of the spines at L4-5 &amp; L5-S1. Nerve root is mobilized to allow access into the spinal canal. Discectomy is performed at L4-5 &amp; L5-S1 in order to decompress the spine. Spacers (Cages) and bone graft are then inserted in between the vertebras at L4-5 &amp; L5- S1, in order to maintain disc height. Six pedicle screws are place bilaterally at L4, L5 &amp; S1. Two rods are inserted bilaterally at L4-S1 to complete the fusion.{% endraw %}
