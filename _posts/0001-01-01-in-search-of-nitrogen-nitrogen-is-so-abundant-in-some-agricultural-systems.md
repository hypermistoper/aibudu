{% raw %}Nitrogen is so abundant in some agricultural systems that it causes a lot of problems. In organic and natural systems, Nitrogen can be a key limiting factor in productivity and the amount of food that can be produced. Recently I have been exploring a diversity of options for increasing the amount of nitrogen in the different gardens that we manage.<br /><br />Help me develop these gardens and make more videos through regular contributions <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/redgardens">https://www.patreon.com/redgardens</a><br /><br />Or use <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/redgardens">https://www.paypal.me/redgardens</a> as a simple, once-off way to support this project and the time and energy that goes into making videos. Thanks so much!<br /><br />Part of the Cloughjordan Ecovillage, Tipperary, Ireland <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thevillage.ie">http://www.thevillage.ie</a>{% endraw %}
