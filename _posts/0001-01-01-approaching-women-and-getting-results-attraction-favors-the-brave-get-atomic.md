She’s obviously into you.”<br />Josh looked doubtful. “I dunno, man. I wouldn’t know what to say. Oh boy, she just looked over again. She’s really cute.”<br />“Dude, you gotta go talk to her, she likes you.”<br />Josh looked down at his food. “Nah, she’s probably not interested anyway.”<br />“Trust me, if she looks at you and smiles, she’s interested. She wants you to go and talk to her.”<br />“Really?”<br />“Yeah.”<br />“Could you do it for me? I mean, I really don’t know what to say,” Josh said.<br />“You sure?”<br />“Oh man, she just looked over again.”<br />“Alright,” Adam said. “But once I break the ice you better get your ass up there.”<br />“You got it.”<br />When the girl looked up again, she was surprised to see Adam, not Josh coming towards her.<br />“Hi,” Adam said. “I hope I’m not disturbing you. My friend, he’s a slow eater… he just asked me to come over and keep you company.” Adam waved over at Josh. “I’m Adam by the way.”<br />“Evelyn,” the girl said with a tentative smile.<br />“Nice to meet you.” Adam held out his hand and continued to engage Evelyn in conversation. A couple of minutes passed by before Josh finally finished his meal and came over to join them.<br />“He’s right. I am a slow eater,” Josh said as he rubbed his stomach.<br />Evelyn glanced at Josh, then turned her attention back to Adam. “You were saying?”<br />Despite Adam’s best effort to include his friend in the conversation, Evelyn appeared to have lost all interest in Josh, even though he was the one who’d initially caught her eye. Her attention and interest was now focused entirely on Adam. As far as Evelyn was concerned, Josh was no longer a contender.<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />What happened? One minute, Evelyn was smiling and flirting with Josh, letting him know she found him attractive, practically inviting him to come over to speak to her. The next minute she was entirely focused on Adam. How could this happen? In one word: confidence. It was Adam, not Josh, who had the guts to go up and talk to her. It didn’t matter that Josh was better looking, his hesitation communicated weakness. It was now too late to redeem the situation. The moment Josh allowed Adam to speak on his behalf was the moment Evelyn lost all attraction for him.<br /><br />If you want to maintain attraction with a woman, right from the moment you first meet her all the way through to a long-term relationship, then I highly recommend you get a copy of my book Atomic Attraction.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/atomic-attraction/">https://www.developattraction.com/atomic-attraction/</a><br /><br />Check out the Get Her Back (Action Plan) for the best way to get your girlfriend back if she's pulled away from you or left you.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/get-her-back/">https://www.developattraction.com/get-her-back/</a><br /><br />Please click the link below to make a donation to support my work via PayPal:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=FAD82HTR5UJ36">https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=FAD82HTR5UJ36</a><br /><br />Click the link below if you need Emergency Email/Skype support:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/emergency-help/">https://www.developattraction.com/emergency-help/</a><br /><br />Click the link below to send me an email or visit my website (DevelopAttraction.com):<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.developattraction.com/">https://www.developattraction.com/</a><br /><br />Trust yourself and trust the process,<br /><br />Chris Canwell{% endraw %}
