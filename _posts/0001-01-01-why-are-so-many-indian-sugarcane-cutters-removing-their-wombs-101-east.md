{% raw %}India is the worldâ€™s largest sugar producer and, each year, one million workers harvest the sugarcane fields.<br /><br /><br /><br />Families travel far from home to live in rough camps by the fields, where they work long days under the hot sun, with only one day off a month.<br /><br /><br /><br />But a strange phenomenon is appearing among the female workers; they complain of severe abdominal pains and acute tiredness. This has led to one in every three having her womb removed.<br /><br /><br /><br />101 East investigates why these women are being persuaded to have invasive surgery and what is behind their pain.{% endraw %}
