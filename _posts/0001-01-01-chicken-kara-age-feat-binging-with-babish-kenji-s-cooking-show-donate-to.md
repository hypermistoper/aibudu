Here's a video for chicken kara-age I shot at my friend Andrew Rea's (Binging with Babish) place in Brooklyn. It's from my new book, The Wok: Recipes and Techniques. If you want exact measurements, you can buy my book. Or just follow along. Or if someone posts the recipe from the book in the comments below, I'll pin it.<br /><br />The knife and wok we are using in this video are both from Babish's merch store, and I would highly recommend both - the wok as a great pan that checks all of the criteria for a good wok (carbon steel, heavy gauge, proper riveted handles, 14-inches, flat bottom) at a very fair price, and the knife is about as good a bang-for-your-buck as you can get for a starter knife:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/cookware">https://www.bingingwithbabish.com/cookware</a><br /><br />Note: I do not get any kind of kickback or anything like that from Andrew's channel or his sales, nor did he ask me to say anything about the gear. I recommend this stuff purely because I think viewers would be interested.<br /><br />You can find a couple other videos we shot on his channel:<br /><br />Stir-Fried Pork and Cucumber: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bY8url_TpM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bY8url_TpM</a><br />Japanese Croquettes and Tempura: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBX3EcUYMzU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBX3EcUYMzU</a>{% endraw %}
