{% raw %}What's happening with Red Bull in 2022?<br /><br />Max Verstappen has finished just 1 out of 3 races after a DNF at the Australian Grand Prix. But that's just the latest in a string of reliability issues.<br /><br />Can the team sort themselves out before it's too late or is the championship already over?<br /><br />Let me know your thoughts on the event in the comments, along with any feedback and suggestions.<br /><br />**Also apologies for the more clickbaity thumbnail than usual, but that's youtube at times, still kinda relevant to the video I reckon**<br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Subscribe to On Track: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIKYc5dNrYknw_oIt3zxTxA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIKYc5dNrYknw_oIt3zxTxA</a><br />Follow On Track Twitter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/On_Track_F1">https://twitter.com/On_Track_F1</a><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Hi there, welcome to the On Track Youtube Channel where you’ll find reviews, predictions, stories, rankings and ratings on the fast-paced world of Formula 1.<br />Make sure to give the video a thumbs up if you enjoyed and click the subscribe button for more F1 related content.
