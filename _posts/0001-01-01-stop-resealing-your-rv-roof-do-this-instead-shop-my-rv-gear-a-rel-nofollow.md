Here they are:<br />✅Eternabond Tape 50' x 6&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3aWrsKs">https://amzn.to/3aWrsKs</a><br />✅Eternabond Tape 50' x 4&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3NeadFX">https://amzn.to/3NeadFX</a><br />✅Eternabond Tape 50' x 2&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/36YQWUV">https://amzn.to/36YQWUV</a><br />✅Camco Water Brush <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3vBir1k">https://amzn.to/3vBir1k</a><br />✅Eternabond Primer <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3aYIs2z">https://amzn.to/3aYIs2z</a><br /><br />UPDATE:  I am getting a few comments that Eternabond MAY NOT BE USED TO COVER SEAMS AND SEALS and THAT IT IS ONLY MEANT FOR TEMPORARY ROOF MEMBRANE REPAIRS, because, well, that is what their RV tech has told them.  That is actually not true at all.  The following is a statement directly from the Eternabond website:<br /><br />&quot;Did you know RV roof seams require yearly maintenance? Use RoofSeal over factory roof seams one time and never do roof seam maintenance again! More than 25 high-end RV manufacturers now use EternaBond products in the manufacturing of their dream machines to ensure their customers will truly have a weather tight, leak-proof RV.&quot;<br /><br />I know of others who have had this tape on their roof over the lap sealant for over 5 years and its held up perfectly.  If applied properly, it will carry a 15 year warranty, which is also stated on their website and in their warranty disclosure.  In fact, this modification was not my original idea... RV'ers have been doing it for years prior to this video.  I was very thorough doing research on how it has held up over the years before we created the video.<br /><br />It's important for everyone watching our channel to understand if we are going to recommend a product in a manner that it is not intended for, we would make full disclosure in the video.  That is not the case for this video.  Eternabond can absolutely be applied to seals and seams as shown in this video.  The important part of this modification is the application.  The surface needs to be cleaned of any debris, dry, and applied with pressure as stated in the manufacturers instructions.  <br /><br />It is equally important to understand Eternabond is not a temporary solution.  When you hear the word &quot;tape&quot; you may think that it is a temporary fix until proper repairs can be made, and rightly so, however Eternabond tape is a permanent solution to roof repairs and sealing seams.  The following statement is also from the Eternabond website:<br /><br />&quot;To most RVers, nothing is more annoying than a pesky water leak, especially one that pops up in a place where there are no repair centers. In the old days, one would squirt on some silicone or, in pure desperation, cover the area with duct tape, but these on-the-spot repairs were very temporary. Thanks to Eternabond®, RV leak repairs are now permanent and hassle free.&quot;<br /><br />⬇️⬇️⬇️Below is a list of RV products we love and use!
