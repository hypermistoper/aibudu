{% raw %}I returned to wow a few weeks ago due to enhance buffs and will be practicing to push rank 1 this season. Arena games in the video were around 2.3 - 2.4 mmr. Wow is pretty fun at the moment as I haven't played it in a long time, feel free to ask any questions about enhance and I'll do my best to answer them.<br /><br />Playlist:<br />Alfred Heinrichs - Moon (nxc) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/8238/4852523l6453456">https://soundcloud.com/8238/4852523l6453456</a><br />Beyazz - Kalt in der Hood (Grassbox Hardtekk Bootleg) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/grassbox/beyazz-kalt-in-der-hood">https://soundcloud.com/grassbox/beyazz-kalt-in-der-hood</a><br />Mental Breakdown <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/monika-ola/mental-breakdown">https://soundcloud.com/monika-ola/mental-breakdown</a>{% endraw %}
