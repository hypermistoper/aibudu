{% raw %}Have you ever wondered whether that complex multi-sided part your making on your 3-axis VMC might be easier to make on a 5-axis machine? Well we were pretty sure we knew the answer to that question, but we wanted to put it to the test, so we asked John Nelson to set up the same multi-sided part on both a VF-4SS and a UMC-500SS to really delve into the differences in workholding, setup, and programming. <br /><br />We think you'll enjoy this information packed dive into how John set up two different machines to make the same part. <br /><br />Here is the link to the UMC-500SS web page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.haascnc.com/machines/vertical-mills/universal-machine/models/umc-500SS.html">https://www.haascnc.com/machines/vertical-mills/universal-machine/models/umc-500SS.html</a><br /><br />Here is the link to the VF-4SS web page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.haascnc.com/machines/vertical-mills/vf-series/models/medium/vf-4ss.html">https://www.haascnc.com/machines/vertical-mills/vf-series/models/medium/vf-4ss.html</a><br /><br />Don’t miss any Haas videos.
