And it’s a shame that she meets her end so early, at least in the show, because more than any other character I’ve covered, she has the most to teach you about how to behave in the real world.  <br /><br />Which is cool, because unlike Littlefinger and Tywin Lannister, I don’t have to tell you NOT to do these things.  We’re talking about good stuff here, so you’ll want to apply a lot of this even if you don't live in the Game of Thrones, beginning with Margaery’s first incredible talent: her ability to build rapport with anyone.
