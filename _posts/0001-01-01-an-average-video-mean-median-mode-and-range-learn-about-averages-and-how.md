Let’s assume you have a data set of test scores, <br /><br />67 96 100 75 45 68 90 93 88 75 96 89 74 82 79<br /><br />becasue teachers love to talk about test scores. <br /><br />The first thing you always want to do when finding an average is to order the numbers from least to greatest. This isn’t necessary for the mean, but is still good practice.<br /><br />45 67 68 74 75 75 79 82 88 89 90 93 94 96 100 <br /><br />So once you have your data set, you find the sum by adding all the numbers together. Then you take this sum and divide it by the total number of data points. We have 15 test scores so we divide 1,215 by 15, which equals 81. This is the mean. It won’t always come out so clean and will likely have several decimals, so you’ll have to round it off.<br /><br />Let's do the mode next. The mode is the most frequently occurring number in a data set. It’s easiest to find this when all the numbers are numerically ordered from least to greatest. In this set we only have one number that is repeated more than once, 75, so that is our mode.<br /><br />If a data set has no repeat values, so every number only appears once, then there is no mode. <br /><br />A data set can also have multiple modes, for example, if you had a data set like this, [pause]<br /><br />the modes would be 15 and 21, because they are the most repeated numbers, with three each. <br /><br />No onto median. The median is the middle value. Again, you want the numbers ordered numerically from least to greatest. The easiest way to find the median is to count from the outside in, like so. If you’re left with a single number in the middle, that is your median. However, if you have an even number of values, you’ll end up two numbers in the middle, so you’ll need to take the mean of those two numbers by adding them together and dividing by 2, this will give you the median. Here is a quick example. <br /><br />In this example, 7 and 9 are both in the middle, so we add those together to get 16 and divide 16 by 2 to get 8. And this is our median for this data set. <br /><br />I want to give an honorable mention here to the range, it’s not really an average, but you may be asked to find it. It's simply the difference between the highest and lowest value. So take the highest value and subtract the lowest value from it, and that’s the range. It just tells you how spread out your data set is. <br /><br />Let’s do a quick recap to help you remember each.<br /><br />The mean is what we most often refer to as the average. It’s the sum of all the values divided by the total number of values.<br />The mode is the most frequently occurring value. There could be none, one, or more than one.<br />The median is the middle value of a data set ordered from least to greatest.<br />And the range is the difference between the highest and lowest values.<br /><br />Let me know in the comments what you thought of this video and if you understand averages better now.<br /><br />Check out these other videos or visit my website to find more. <br /><br />Thanks for watching, and i’ll catch you next time!{% endraw %}
