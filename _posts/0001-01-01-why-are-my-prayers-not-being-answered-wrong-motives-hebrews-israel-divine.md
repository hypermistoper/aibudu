{% raw %}#hebrews #israel #divine #chosen <br /><br />Psalm 101:5<br />Whoever secretly slanders his neighbor, him I will destroy;<br />No one who has a haughty look and an arrogant heart will I endure.<br /><br /><br /><br />John 7:24 KJVS [24] Judge not according to the appearance, but judge righteous judgment. The Bible says when we judge ourselves and our neighbors our judgment must be in righteousness. Not what I heard from someone else about that person or what I think, but rather moral truth.<br /><br />Ephesians 5:11<br />Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.<br /><br />Romans 12:2<br />And be not conformed to this world: but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind, that ye may prove what is that good, and acceptable, and perfect, will of God.<br /><br />John 14:15 <br />â€œIf you love me, you will keep my commandments.<br /><br />Isaiah 5:20<br />Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!<br /><br />John 3:20<br />For everyone who does wicked things hates the light and does not come to the light, lest his works should be exposed.<br /><br />Proverbs 8:13<br />The fear of the Lord is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate.<br /><br />Proverbs 14:12<br />There is a way that seems right to a man, but its end is the way to death.<br /><br />Proverbs 6:16-19<br />There are six things that the Lord hates, seven that are an abomination to him: haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers.{% endraw %}
