{% raw %}I'd like to talk about whether it was worth it for me to pay that much money for a pair of running shoes.<br />The Altra Vanish Carbon is Altra's first Carbon fiber plated running shoe and I needed to test them out for my local half marathon.<br /><br />The carbon-plated marathon racing market now has a bouncy, 0mm drop option called the Altra Vanish Carbon. The Vanish Carbon packs Altraâ€™s most energetic foam, an efficient rocker geometry, and a unique carbon fiber plate all into a race day package that features a roomy fit through the toebox in comparison to other carbon plated racing shoes.<br /><br />The Vanish Carbon gives runners a propulsive and well-cushioned road racing option that offers modern performance while staying true to the brand's natural-feeling fit and zero-drop design. This unique racing shoe features an all new foam called EGOPRO which is Altraâ€™s lightest and most energy-efficient compound available, and embedded in the comfortably bouncy foam is a segmented carbon fiber plate with a fork-like design. The 3-finger carbon plate gives runners a more natural ride that works with the foot while also providing an efficient and snappy toe-off.<br /><br />The overall geometry of the Vanish Carbon is highly efficient through the use of the Active Stance Rocker, and it's built to create an ultra smooth ride at a variety of paces. The toe-box shape is designed to be slightly wider than traditional shoes and falls into Altraâ€™s thinnest, but still naturally roomy, SLIM category. The outsole of the Vanish Carbon displays a healthy amount of rubber for optimal traction and the lightweight upper secures the foot while also being breathable and race-ready.<br /><br />ðŸ‘‰ Subscribe to support my Channel<br />ðŸ‘‰ Follow me on Strava: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/41401046">https://www.strava.com/athletes/41401046</a><br /><br />Want to do business with me?
