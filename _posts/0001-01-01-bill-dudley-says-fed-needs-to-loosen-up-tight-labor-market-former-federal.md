{% raw %}Former Federal Reserve Bank of New York President Bill Dudley says the Fed should pursue efforts to ease the &quot;unprecedentedly tight&quot; US labor market to get inflation under control. &quot;The labor market is the tightest basically it's ever been,&quot; he says on Bloomberg Television. &quot;The Fed needs to loosen that up or wage pressures will accumulate and that will keep inflation above the Fed's 2% inflation objective.&quot; Dudley's opinions are his own.&quot;{% endraw %}
