{% raw %}Back in vanilla wow, There was a dagger called &quot;Finkle's Skinner&quot; which dropped off the Beast in Upper Blackrock Spire. The dagger was one of 2 weapons in vanilla that gave a +10 skill up in skinning while it was equipped. Since not all classes could equip daggers, others were forced to farm the Sword &quot;Zulian Slicer&quot; instead, which had a similar equip effect. Now whats different about these skinning knifes as apposed to other skill up items, is that these were needed for progression raiding. <br /><br /><br />--Social Media--<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hirumared">https://twitter.com/hirumared</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Hirumaredx">https://www.facebook.com/Hirumaredx</a><br />Twitch Stream -<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitch.tv/theduellogs">http://www.twitch.tv/theduellogs</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/hirumaredx">http://www.patreon.com/hirumaredx</a><br /><br />If you can't get enough of my videos you can always check out my other channels as well -<br /><br />World of Warcraft - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/hirumaredx">https://www.youtube.com/user/hirumaredx</a><br />Yu-Gi-Oh - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1Ih24ZT">http://bit.ly/1Ih24ZT</a><br />Pet Battles (in WoW) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/HirusGames">https://www.youtube.com/user/HirusGames</a><br />Top 10s - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1Jqqzab">http://bit.ly/1Jqqzab</a><br />Jokes - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheUnfunnyJokes">https://www.youtube.com/user/TheUnfunnyJokes</a><br />MetroidVania - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1H7383N">http://bit.ly/1H7383N</a><br />Heros of The Storm - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1ARc7Vw">http://bit.ly/1ARc7Vw</a><br />Reddit videos- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1H73bwx">http://bit.ly/1H73bwx</a><br />Anime stuff - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/IonlyPlayTinker">https://www.youtube.com/user/IonlyPlayTinker</a><br />Devbots Channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Dv70pQf855xw4Pr403sEg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0Dv70pQf855xw4Pr403sEg</a><br /><br />Partner with Curse, Seriously they're great - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tinyurl.com/oohwbdy">http://tinyurl.com/oohwbdy</a><br /><br />Some of the Video backgrounds in this video were made by &quot;Amitai Angor AA VFX&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/dvdangor2011">https://www.youtube.com/dvdangor2011</a>{% endraw %}
