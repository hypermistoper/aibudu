{% raw %}An extremely captivating sighting of a leopard climbing down from a tree and attempting to hunt an unsuspecting family of warthogs. <br /><br />BOOK YOUR TRIP TO KRUGER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BookatKruger">http://bit.ly/BookatKruger</a><br /><br />This exciting sighting was captured by 36-year-old, Mechanical Engineer, Jan-Louis Human and, 30-year-old, Wildlife Photographic Guide, Moosa Varachia, while on a game drive on the S119 near Berg-en-Dal in the Kruger National Park. <br />Send in your wildlife video here, and earn money: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.latestsightings.com/partnership">https://www.latestsightings.com/partnership</a><br /><br />Both Jan-Louis and Moosa tell LatestSightings.com the story: “It was a stunning Monday afternoon and I was taking it all in before the gates of the park closed. I came across a squirrel who was alarm calling nearby. The alarm calls from the squirrel lead us to believe that the leopard was close by. Although we were looking for the leopard neither one of us could spot it.”<br /><br />“After some time searching for the leopard, Moosa spotted her relaxing on a low branch in a nearby tree and we stopped our car so we could have a clear view of her. There were only two cars at the leopard sighting, we basically had her to ourselves.”<br /><br />“We then spotted a family of warthogs walking down the road. The leopard instantly lifted her head and had her eye on them. We got our cameras ready and anticipated (hoped) that she would make a kill!”<br /><br />“The warthogs walked past Jan-Louis's car, and went down the road. She came down from the tree and momentarily disappeared into the long grass. As she walked through the grass towards the road, we could see the tip of her tail here and there. She then leopard crawled as she moved the last few feet towards the edge of the road. She lay down and waited - completely camouflaged in the tall grass.”<br /><br />“For some reason, the warthogs turned around and started walking back in the direction of where she was hiding. In the next moment, there was action!! She launched herself out of the grass and went after one of the piglets. The warthogs all scattered and ran in different directions!” <br />“She chased them down the road for a few meters before she gave up on the chase. She then walked backed in our direction and disappeared into the tall grass towards the riverbed.”<br />Moosa has been fortunate enough to have seen many hunts and failed hunts but this happening on the road right in front of him made it all the more special. For Jan-Louis he was very excited as it was a first. <br />“Sightings like this are what makes it all worth it!” <br /><br />To license the footage: <br /><br />Contact@LatestSightings.com<br /><br /><br /><br />Get some of our exclusive specials at the Kruger National Park (Free nights): <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.latestsightings.com/specials">https://www.latestsightings.com/specials</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Snapchat: LatestSightings<br /><br />Twitter &amp; Instagram: @LatestKruger<br /><br /><br /><br />For live wildlife sightings in the Kruger National Park: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.latestsightings.com/">http://www.latestsightings.com/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />And like our Facebook page for great sightings and photos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/latestsightingskruger">https://www.facebook.com/latestsightingskruger</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Subscribe to us on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/LatestSightings">http://www.youtube.com/LatestSightings</a>{% endraw %}
