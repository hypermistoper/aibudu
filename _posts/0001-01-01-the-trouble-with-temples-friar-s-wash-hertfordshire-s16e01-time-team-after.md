But a 30-year-old photograph clearly shows double square cropmarks in a field. Surely this time they will strike lucky? The trouble is, the site may have suffered plough damage. Francis takes charge. Though initial excavations are encouraging, John and Stewart are puzzled by a geophysical anomaly. Including a tessellated pavement and a coin hoard, a picture gradually emerges of not one but four temples - in fact a whole complex of buildings. It proves to be one of the most important excavations in Time Team history.<br /><br />Series 16, Episode 01<br /><br />#TimeTeam #BritishHistory #Hertforsdshire #BritishRoman<br /><br />Time Team is a British TV series following specialists who dig deep to uncover as much as they can about Britain's archaeology and history.<br />For more Time Team content, check out the Time Team Official YouTube Channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TimeTeamOfficial">https://www.youtube.com/c/TimeTeamOfficial</a> <br /><br />** TIME TEAM HAS JOINED PATREON! **<br />Support Time Team by becoming a patron and get access to exclusive behind-the-scenes content here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/timeteamofficial">https://www.patreon.com/timeteamofficial</a> <br /><br />** MERCHANDISE **<br />You can now purchase Time Team's Official merchandise here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.timeteamdigital.com/">https://shop.timeteamdigital.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe for FULL EPISODES every Wednesday and Sunday.{% endraw %}
