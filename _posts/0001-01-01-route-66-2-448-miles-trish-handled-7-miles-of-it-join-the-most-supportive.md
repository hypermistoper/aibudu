She enjoys towing with our Super Duty ... but when it comes to driving the Bird, her response was clear, &quot;I'm out!&quot; Driving large equipment does take some getting used to and we receive countless emails about how to help a spouse become more comfortable with driving a motorized RV or towing. Perhaps we should have followed some of the tips below so Trish would be more comfortable with driving the Bird! In this episode, we travel Route 66 from the mid-point in Adrian, TX to the Blue Hole in New Mexico and then to Santa Fe. We visit the decommissioned Musical Highway before making our way to the Petrified Forest National Park and then a particular corner in Winslow Arizona. Join us next week for the season finale of Route 66 in Santa Monica California. <br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏è KYD Insiders <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/KeepYourDaydream">https://www.patreon.com/KeepYourDaydream</a> <br />Join the most supportive and genuine RV community ever.
