Engine 273 stretched a line and began extinguishing visible flames. The fire quickly made its way into the walls and voids spreading rapidly. A second alarm was transmitted by Battalion 52, Division 14 would transmit the 3rd and 4th. Multiple Tower Ladders were set up to douse the flames along with hand lines from adjoining roofs.
