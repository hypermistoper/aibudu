We are working hard to get our videos uploaded. We provide you with word pronunciations, definitions, translations, stories, rhymes, riddles, jokes, tongue twisters, and anything that will help bridge the gap between your current fluency to your desired proficiency and understanding. Whether you're just learning or trying to bolster your intellectual quotient into a new stratosphere of concise and succinct communications, allocating the proper verbiage could be paramount to illustrating a picture for the recipient or merely shoving drab nondescript sounds of failure down their auditory meatuses. Run on sentence you say? I'd agree. Utilizing big complicated words isn't usually the most effective form of communication, but adapting your language to your recipient will be the most effective way to transfer your thoughts. Having a wide array of tools for each project will allow you to tailor your message for the most effect and efficient use of your time. To write, read, and listen to language takes fewer words than you might imagine. In each language, you could likely get away with understanding a few thousand words and be completely comfortable with many different language settings. Why even a few hundred can get you quite far. <br /><br />If ever you find any of the words to be inaccurate in any way, which may most often be the pronunciation I want to thank anyone who reaches out to send me a message regarding any errors. I will do my best to read and correct any perceived errors. Be advised that many pronunciation can vary slightly between regions.<br /><br />My congratulations to anyone broadening their word bank in any language. Science is clear that with more word associations languages become easier to learn and has the potential to be a protective buffer against dementia and Alzheimer's Disease.<br /><br />Please visit www.seehearsaylearn.com<br /><br />FACEBOOK FOLLOW<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/seehearsaylearn">https://www.facebook.com/seehearsaylearn</a><br />TWITTER FOLLOW<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/seehearsaylearn">https://www.twitter.com/seehearsaylearn</a><br />YOUTUBE SUBSCRIBE<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/c/SeeHearSayLearn?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/c/SeeHearSayLearn?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />PLEASE DONATE via VENMO for MORE EDUCATIONAL CONTENT and ENDEAVORS<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://venmo.com/SeeHearSayLearn">https://venmo.com/SeeHearSayLearn</a><br /><br />THANK for WATCHING, SUBSCRIBING, LIKING, COMMENTING, SHARING and DONATING!!!<br />It means a lot to my family!<br /><br />This video series couldn't do what it does without the help of Wikipedia and its community along with so many other people to thank and we look forward to refining our product.{% endraw %}
