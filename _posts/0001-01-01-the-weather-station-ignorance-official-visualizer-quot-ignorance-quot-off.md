{% raw %}&quot;Ignorance&quot; off of The Weather Station's new album 'How Is It That I Should Look At The Stars.'<br /><br />Stream/buy 'How Is It That I Should Look At The Stars': <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://TheWeatherStation.lnk.to/HIITISLATSID">https://TheWeatherStation.lnk.to/HIITISLATSID</a><br /><br />_____<br />LYRICS:<br />I was woken up in the early morning after my flight, by a sound I could not grasp, I did not recognize.  Running like water, two toned, and tangled like a wire, flowing, jangled, many sounds at once.  “It was a magpie”, you told me, as you handed me a coffee, “the black and white bird you see in city parks.” And you pointed out the window - looking straight in at me - a black and white bird sitting on the fence.  I thought about the man who called it a magpie; confronted by the great expanse of his ignorance, he wanted to name it, to detain it, forever in that small phrase.  It seemed like a shame, to give it a name.  But then again, I don’t understand anything the way I’m supposed to.  I drag every river for meaning, scrape my hand on every ceiling.  I never know what to say or not say, what to honour or betray in any given day.  But I never got used to the sound of the magpie it set my skin on edge, it called like a child like a dog like the wind caught in a fence. When we talked it interrupted, and I would never know what it meant.<br /><br />Follow The Weather Station:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/theweatherstation/">https://www.instagram.com/theweatherstation/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheWeatherStn/">https://www.facebook.com/TheWeatherStn/</a><br /><br />#TheWeatherStation #HowIsItThatIShouldLookAtTheStars #Ignorance{% endraw %}
