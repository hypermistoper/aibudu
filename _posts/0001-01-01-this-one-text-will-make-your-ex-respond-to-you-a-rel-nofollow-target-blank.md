The truth is you’re boring, well actually not you but your text messages are boring throughout the relationship you’ve got into certain patterns with texting your ex.  <br /><br />I’m going to teach you my methods that I teach to my one to one clients, this is a three step method; <br /><br />#1 – The Premise <br />#2 – The Hook <br />#3 – The Payoff <br /><br />Most people don’t know how to send a text to their ex, but what you need to know is that every text you send to your ex needs to be interesting and needs to comprise three specific data points. <br /><br />#1 – The Premise <br />Usually this is going to be something that fascinates your ex that you know they’ll respond to, something that catches their interest. This is something you’re going to craft your text message around. <br /><br /> #2 – The Hook <br />This text needs to be something that will make your ex respond, the specific phrase or set of words you use to really make your ex invest into texting you back. A great hook text is going to create a great pattern interrupt or its going to create enough curiosity that will make your ex reply to you. <br /><br />#3 – The Payoff <br />Probably the easiest to explain and the most difficult to implement, here’s how it works. Your job is simply to make your ex feel like they didn’t waste your time responding to you. There needs to be some type of positive emotion that they get out of the text interaction <br /><br />Now generally speaking your premise and your payoff are going to be interconnected.  <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.exboyfriendrecovery.com/the-texting-bible/">https://www.exboyfriendrecovery.com/the-texting-bible/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.exboyfriendrecovery.com/coaching/">https://www.exboyfriendrecovery.com/coaching/</a>{% endraw %}
