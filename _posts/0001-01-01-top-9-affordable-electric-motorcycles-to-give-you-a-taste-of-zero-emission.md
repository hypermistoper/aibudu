{% raw %}If you look closely at the changes in the transportation industry, it's hard not to notice that electric vehicle segment is on the rise. Successful investments in battery technology, smarter control units and electric motors by both EV startups and manufacturers with long history of auto and motorcycle-making allowed them to produce models that are faster, more efficient in terms of recharging times and could go longer on a single charge. <br /><br />There is a lot of interest towards battery-powered transport from the consumers, who want to try this emerging technology. But if you think that they only want to drive electric cars, you wouldn't be necessarily right. While most cars and SUVs are still some time away from being affordable, it's motorcycles, scooters and bicycles that tend to attract most attention.<br /><br />Bikes and scooters are already great means for city commuting: they are light and are definitely cheaper and more agile than large vehicles. By adding an e-motor with a powerful battery manufacturers are making bikes that are already great commuters even better. As a result, people in India and Asian countries started switching to e-motorcycles and e-scooters more often, while consumers from Europe and North America are showing great interest in ebikes and all-electric motorbikes. In case you missed some of the latest trends in this field, feel free to catch up on the news here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeYSci69dx4lp9xBgbW-pLJ-1G-wphplS">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeYSci69dx4lp9xBgbW-pLJ-1G-wphplS</a><br /><br />Everything seems great with this new technology, but just like any other modern invention, motorcycles with batteries are still considered expensive, if we compare them to regular models. However, their production numbers are increasing all the time, new competitors arise, and the economy of scale kicks in, resulting in the decreasing prices with each upcoming model year. <br /><br />Here we would like to review basic information about motorcycles that are currently on sale with the lowest prices, as we would like to see if these cheap models are worth the investment for the specifications that are offering and if they could help us open a new zero emission chapter in the history of city commute.{% endraw %}
