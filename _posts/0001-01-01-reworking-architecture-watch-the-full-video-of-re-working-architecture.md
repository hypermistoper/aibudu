{% raw %}Watch the full video of (Re)Working Architecture!<br /><br />(Re)Working Architecture documents an October, 2015 event in which Architecture Lobby members used principles from Theatre of the Oppressed to perform ten scenes that embody current labor conflicts within the field of architecture, discuss said conflicts and, finally, role play alternative, more equitable, futures. <br /><br />Filmed by Mass Ornament, an award winning video art practice, in October 2015 at the Co-Prosperity Sphere in an event parallel to the Chicago Biennial, the scenes of (Re)Working Architecture have their origin in the Architecture Lobby's 10-point manifesto demanding better labor practices in and changed structures for architecture. <br /><br />The premiere of (Re)Working Architecture took place on May 20th, 2016 at the Slought Foundation in Philadelphia at an event parallel to the 2016 AIA National Convention.<br />    <br />The Architecture Lobby is an organization of architectural workers advocating for the value of architecture in the general public and for architectural work within the discipline. It believes that the work architects do – aesthetic, technical, social, organizational, environmental, administrative, fiduciary – needs structural change to be more rewarding and more socially relevant.  As long as architecture tolerates abusive practices in the office and the construction site, it cannot insist on its role in and for the public good.<br /><br />CREDITS:<br />A film by <br />The Architecture Lobby<br /><br />A Mass Ornament production<br />Anahita Ghazvinizadeh<br />Yoni Goldstein<br />Zoe Sua Cho<br /><br />Edited by <br />Mass Ornament<br />Manuel Shvartzberg<br />Peggy Deamer<br />Keefer Dunn<br />Quilian Riano<br /><br />Scene scripts by<br />Francisco Alvarez Rincon<br />Phil Bernstein <br />Peggy Deamer<br />Amy Dewante<br />Keefer Dunn<br />Mike Finn<br />Tom Fisher<br />Sean Flynn<br />Sben Korsh<br />William Martin<br />Ben Martinson<br />Mike Molitsky<br />Skylar Moran<br />John Pasowicz<br />Jesse Pazmino<br />Pierce Reynoldson<br />Quilian Riano<br />Manuel Shvartzberg<br />Khoudia Sylla<br /><br />Performance facilitation by<br />William Martin<br />Quilian Riano<br /><br />Featuring<br />Elaina Berkowitz<br />Nishant Chacko<br />Amy Dewante<br />Keefer Dunn<br />Mike Finn<br />Sukjong Hong<br />Matthew Lohry<br />William Martin<br />Mike Molitsky<br />Skylar Moran<br />Nabila Gloria Morales Perez<br />John Pasowicz<br />Jesse Pazmino<br />Quilian Riano<br />Anna Schaefferkoetter<br />Manuel Shvartzberg<br />Violet Whitney<br /><br />Set design and production by…<br /><br />Keefer Dunn<br />Garrett Chow<br />Jesse Pazmino<br />Ferdinand Kuznik<br />Skylar Moran<br /><br />Wall paper and pamphlets by<br />Sean Yendris<br /><br />Special thanks to<br />All Participants<br />Peggy Deamer<br />Ben Martinson<br />Anahita Ghazvinizadeh<br />Yoni Goldstein<br />Zoe Sua Cho<br />Danielle Dean<br />Julia Ellen Pedtke<br />Kayhan Irani<br />Bill Menking<br />Mary Ferrari<br />Cynette Sylla<br />Khoudia Sylla<br />Sben Korsh<br />Yolande Daniels<br />Sukjong Hong <br /><br /><br />Shot at Co-Prosperity Sphere, Chicago, IL, during the 2015 Chicago Architecture Biennial<br /><br />30 October – 1 November, 2015<br /><br /><br />The Architecture Lobby<br /><br />www.architecture-lobby.org<br />@arch_lobby <br />info@architecture-lobby.org{% endraw %}
