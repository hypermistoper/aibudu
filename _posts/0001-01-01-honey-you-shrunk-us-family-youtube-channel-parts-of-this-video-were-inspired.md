{% raw %}Parts of this video were inspired by a script sent to us by our subscriber Marcel. Thank you so much for the great ideas!<br /><br />Alamo Mom decides it's funny to play with our shrunk ray and that's when disaster strikes. Alamo Mom and Alamo Dad relive their bad memories of being shrunk. Austin, Landon and Alexia assume their parents left and take advantage of the situation. They eat cereal with soda, slide down the stairs and someone decides to put on makeup. Will Alamo Mom and Dad make it through this time?<br /><br />#familyfun   #youtubefamily #shrunk  #trynottolaugh  #familychannel #skits #shrink #nightmare #stairslide #momsfault #dadsfault #cerealwithsoda<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE for more fun videos like this:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPADc1KMF_mwa-byaWWZLEw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPADc1KMF_mwa-byaWWZLEw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />0:29 Kids get in trouble<br />1:38 Parents get shrunk<br />2:14 Alamo Dad's nightmare<br />3:43 Alamo Mom and Dad Plan #1<br />5:11 Cereal with Soda!<br />6:00 Shrunk Stair Slide<br />8:30 Alamo Dad stuck on car<br />9:33 Kids slide down stairs<br />10:40 Alamo Mom and Dad unshrunk<br />11:02 Whose fault??<br /><br />Watch our most recent videos here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPADc1KMF_mwa-byaWWZLEw/videos">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPADc1KMF_mwa-byaWWZLEw/videos</a><br /><br />Contact us at: RememberTheAlamoFamily@gmail.com<br /><br /><br />About Remember the Alamos channel:<br />Remember the Alamos, created by the Alamo family, is a kid friendly â€“ family friendly channel.
