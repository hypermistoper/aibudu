{% raw %}The PUMA IFV in War Thunder is a German Light Tank with a 30mm cannon that fires tiny APFSDS rounds.  Although it boasts and impressive 120mm of penetration, the thing that really makes this thing stand out is that it's practically invincible.<br /><br />With NERA and ERA covering almost every inch of this vehicle, HEAT-FS and even TANDOM warheads will do little to no damage.  The crew are also surrounded by the components of the engine and transmission meaning they are extremely hard to knock out.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the most absurd vehicles I've ever played in WT.  You can just W key your way to success!  Awesome!<br /><br />GET 3% OFF:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=WarThunder&amp;partner=Oddbawz&amp;partner_val=2bpa5qx4">https://store.gaijin.net/catalog.php?category=WarThunder&amp;partner=Oddbawz&amp;partner_val=2bpa5qx4</a><br />Merch:  oddbawz-shop.creator-spring.com<br />Discord:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/oddbawz">https://discord.gg/oddbawz</a><br />Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/oddbawz/">https://www.instagram.com/oddbawz/</a><br />Twitter:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/OddBawZ">https://twitter.com/OddBawZ</a><br />Business Email:  oddbaw01@gmail.com<br />Patreon:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/join/oddbawz">https://www.patreon.com/join/oddbawz</a><br /><br />NUKE INTRO (00:00)<br />THE POOMA (02:37)<br />GAME 1 - DESERT STORMING (04:56)<br />GAME 2 - WINTER WARRIOR (10:06)<br />GAME 3 - THIS IS GETTING RIDICULOUS (11:46)<br />GAME 4 - THE QUICKEST GAME I'VE EVER SEEN (15:10)<br />GAME 5 - UNSTOPPABLE (17:41)<br />OUTRO (21:56){% endraw %}
