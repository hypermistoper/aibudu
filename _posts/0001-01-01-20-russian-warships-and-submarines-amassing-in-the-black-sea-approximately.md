{% raw %}APPROXIMATELY 20 Russian warships and submarines have entered the Black Sea's operational zone, an intelligence update from the Ministry of Defence (MoD) has warned.<br />Vladimir Putin's troops have taken yet another step in Russia's military campaign against Ukraine after it was revealed Moscow has assembled offensive vessels in the Black Sea. The Kremlin's newest threat to Kyiv was exposed by the MoD in an intelligence update posted to Twitter this morning. It said: &quot;Approximately 20 Russian Navy vessels are currently in the Black Sea operational zone, including submarines.<br />&quot;The Bosporus Strait remains closed to all non-Turkish warships, rendering Russia unable to replace its lost cruiser Moskva in the Black Sea.&quot;<br />The MoD has also warned that the vessels assembling in the Black Sea could pose a serious threat to Ukraine.<br />They claimed: &quot;Despite the embarrassing losses of the landing ship Saratov and cruiser Moskva, Russiaâ€™s Black Sea Fleet retains the ability to strike Ukrainian and coastal targets.&quot;<br />The intelligence update comes after Defence Secretary Ben Wallace claimed the Kremlin had sustained heavy losses since launching its invasion of Ukraine on February 24.{% endraw %}
