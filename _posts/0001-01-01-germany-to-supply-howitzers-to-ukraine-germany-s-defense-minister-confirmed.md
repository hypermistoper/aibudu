{% raw %}Germany's defense minister confirmed Friday during her visit to Slovakia that her country will supply Ukraine with seven powerful self-propelled howitzers to help defend itself against Russia. <br /><br />Christine Lambrecht said Ukrainian soldiers will be trained in Germany to use the self-propelled Panzerhaubitze 2000 artillery weapon, which is capable of firing precision ammunition at up to 40 kilometers. <br /><br />Germany has stepped up its support for Ukraine in recent weeks, after the government's initial reticence to provide heavy weapons drew widespread criticism. <br /><br />(AP) <br /><br />» Subscribe to VOA News: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3KIPysi">https://bit.ly/3KIPysi</a><br />» Watch more VOA News video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/VOANews">https://www.youtube.com/c/VOANews</a><br /><br />Voice of America (VOA) is the largest U.S. international broadcaster, providing news and information in more than 40 languages to an estimated weekly audience of 236.8 million people.
