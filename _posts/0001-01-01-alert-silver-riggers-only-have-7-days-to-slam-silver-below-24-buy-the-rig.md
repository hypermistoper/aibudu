{% raw %}BofA has to cook their books by March 30th to both hide their massive silver lease holdings and clean up their 1Q reporting for 2022. Will they do it? These banksters always have so I wouldn't put it by them...but if they do try to slam silver below the Moving Averages to force the hand of the tech funds THAT WILL BE YOUR FINAL GIFT FROM THE SILVER RIGGERS.  My suggestion...Buy silver on the End of Quarter Rig!{% endraw %}
