{% raw %}A Fry up breakfast at it's best - and quite possibly the best in Kent. I used to eat breakfast here at The Dalby Cafe in Margate many years ago. I have returned to Kent today to find out if the quality of food is the same as it was. <br />The answer is an easy YES. In fact it's off the charts.<br />This breakfast is without question in my top 3 breakfast ever<br />There is nothing like a greasy spoon breakfast when the food quality is as good as this. Completely off the charts from the bubble, over easy eggs, amazing sausages, fried bread &amp; that fresh bread that leaves your finger prints in because of the freshness. <br />Just Wow.<br />With a cheeky tour of Margate showing where only fools and horses was filmed, the Turner Centre, Margate Old Town, The Lido and Dreamland.<br /><br />To see more of my food eating locations in and around London:<br /><br />@Darren John <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/DarrenJohn">https://www.youtube.com/c/DarrenJohn</a>{% endraw %}
