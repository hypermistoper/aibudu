{% raw %}Irving Finkel, Assistant Keeper I with responsibility for cuneiform in the Department of the Middle East, British Museum.<br /><br />This talk, illustrated by a PowerPoint, will describe what befell the speaker after one quite remarkable cuneiform tablet was brought for examination to the British Museum in London. The inscription on this four-thousand-year-old tablet led to a series of altogether unexpected discoveries, demanding a whole new look at Noah and his Ark, and culminating in a book and a documentary film.<br /><br />Our lectures are free and available to the public thanks to the generous support of our members.
