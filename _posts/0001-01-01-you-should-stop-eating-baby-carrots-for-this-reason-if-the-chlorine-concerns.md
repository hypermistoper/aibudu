{% raw %}If the chlorine concerns you , purchase organic baby-cut carrots instead! Organic baby-cut carrots are soaked in a non-toxic, citrus solution called Citrox. Citrox is an all-natural alternative to chlorine, and is often used to decontaminate organic produce and other food and beverage products. You could also simply purchase larger carrots and then chop them into smaller pieces. <br /><br />Unfortunately, lots of other pre-cut vegetables are soaked in chlorine too. To avoid chemicals, I recommend always purchasing organic! The hidden costs associated with non-organic produce including health risks, and environmental issues are far higher than the premium price for organic products.<br />============<br /><br />Dear subscribers, i want to thank all of you for your support, and  i want you to know that the door is open for anyone see him/ her self could create a video or record by his voice to upload it to my channel, thank you<br /><br />contact us <br />www.facebook.com/misha.barca<br /><br />FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK<br />www.facebook.com/tabkhat<br /><br />twitter<br />www.twitter.com/miamolosiva<br /><br />source:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.riseearth.com/2017/01/the-toxic-truth-about-baby-carrots-why.html">http://www.riseearth.com/2017/01/the-toxic-truth-about-baby-carrots-why.html</a>{% endraw %}
