Jane. Smith then returned to his seat and yelled to Rock, twice, saying &quot;Keep my wife's name out your f***ing mouth!&quot; Pinkett Smith had been diagnosed with alopecia in 2018 and would later shave her head due to the condition. Later in the night, Smith was named Best Actor for King Richard and apologized to the Academy of Motion Pictures and the other nominees, but not to Rock, in his acceptance speech. Following public backlash, Smith issued a formal apology. ABC, The Academy, and the Screen Actors Guild condemned Smith following the incident, which is currently being reviewed by the Academy's Board of Governors. Rock declined to press charges against Smith, according to the Los Angeles Police Department.<br /><br />On April 1, 2022, Smith pre-emptively tendered his resignation from the Academy, writing in part:<br /><br />&quot;I deprived other nominees and winners of their opportunity to celebrate and be celebrated for their extraordinary work. I am heartbroken. I want to put the focus back on those who deserve attention for their achievements and allow the Academy to get back to the incredible work it does to support creativity and artistry in film. So, I am resigning from membership in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, and will accept any further consequences the Board deems appropriate.&quot;<br /><br />The AMPAS President David Rubin accepted the resignation in an official statement but said they would continue their investigation. Smith's resignation means he is no longer able to vote on Oscar nominations as a member of the Academy. Commentators have speculated that Smith's resignation from the Academy and other related fallout from the slap would damage his &quot;family brand.&quot;<br /><br />The Behavior Panel is a group made up of the world's top 4 body language and behavior experts, Scott Rouse, Mark Bowden, Chase Hughes, and Greg Hartley.
