{% raw %}Dubai is one of the most beautiful cities in the world, but if you look closely, cracks start to appear. The structure of the city is strange, spaced out and pretty much requires people to have a car. It has huge artificial islands, all done with sand from beneath the ocean (killing a lot of sea life), which by the way… are sinking, and the ocean level is rising. To top it all off, there are numerous stories and claims of labor abuse (mostly migrants from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and some other countries), which have worsened during the pandemic.<br />Oh… and did I mention the poop trucks that come out of the Burj Khalifa? Yeah, the tallest building in the world doesn’t have a proper sewer system, so they fill tracks with poop.<br />Yeah, Dubai is definitely an interesting case.<br /><br /><br />Join our secret epic membership for perks.
