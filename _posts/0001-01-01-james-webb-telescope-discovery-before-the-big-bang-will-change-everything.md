{% raw %}The James Webb Space Telescope. Named after late government official, James Webb, who oversaw NASA for a number of years during his time in public service, James Webb Space Telescope is NASA's largest and most powerful space science telescope. It's one of NASA's Great Observatories that includes massive space telescopes like the Hubble Telescope that peer deep into the universe.<br />NASA's James Webb Space Telescope will explore the cosmos to learn more about the universe's history, from the Big Bang to the formation of alien planets and beyond. It is created to answer perhaps the most perplexing question of all: whether there is someone, or something, alive out there in the cosmos or if we are completely alone. In order to work towards finding the possibility of life, scientists recently explained what, precisely, Webb should be looking for in pursuit of alien life.<br />The $10 billion James Webb Space Telescope is an infrared space observatory equipped with four science instruments that will enable observations in visible, near-infrared and mid-infrared wavelengths. It is this feature of the telescope that is going to help the scientists get their answers. So, when the James Webb aims at exoplanet atmospheres, it’ll use spectroscopy to identify chemical elements. One of the things it’s looking for is methane, a chemical compound that can indicate the presence of life.<br /><br />jwst,james webb,james webb telescope,edge of the universe,james webb telescope discovery,jwst proxima b,universe discovery,end of the universe,james webb big bang,james webb picture,james webb discovery,hubble,destiny,voyager,ridddle,techspace,starship,elon musk,spacex,space,science,documentary,space news,james webb news,jwst update,stepehen hawking,black hole,theory of everything,singularity,nasa discovery,nasa,universe edge,james webb space telescope{% endraw %}
