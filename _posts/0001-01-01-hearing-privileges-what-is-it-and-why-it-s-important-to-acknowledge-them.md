{% raw %}What is hearing privilege, why it's important for all hearing people to be aware of it and what are some of the examples that exists today?<br /><br />The word 'privilege' has become somewhat of an uncomfortable word lately. It seems to have a stigma that you have an easy life if you have privileges or it's fiercely denied that it gives you an advantage over others.<br /><br />But parts of having privileges is about having a head start in your life (be it personal, career, business, etc.) over others who are in marginalised groups. There's no shame in that, but it's important to acknowledge that, appreciate what you have, be grateful for it and then understand how you can help others.<br /><br />So if you are a hearing person, you most certainly have certain privileges over non-hearing (deaf, hard of hearing, deafblind, deafened, etc.). It's not a bad thing, but it's good to be aware of it. But then again, it is also possible for deaf people to have privileges too, and these are explained in the video and the link below.<br /><br />For transcripts, more information about my deaf privileges and even more examples of hearing privileges, visit this page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hearmeoutcc.com/hearing-privileges/">https://hearmeoutcc.com/hearing-privileges/</a><br /><br />---<br /><br />Connect with me:<br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/IamAhmedKhalifa">https://www.twitter.com/IamAhmedKhalifa</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/IamAhmedKhalifa">https://www.facebook.com/IamAhmedKhalifa</a><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/IamAhmedKhalifa">https://www.instagram.com/IamAhmedKhalifa</a><br />Be a Patron - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/IamAhmedKhalifa">https://www.patreon.com/IamAhmedKhalifa</a> <br /><br />Captioned and transcribed via Happy Scribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.happyscribe.com/r/c95bf01891">https://www.happyscribe.com/r/c95bf01891</a><br /><br />Equipment I use - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kit.co/iamahmedkhalifa/video-recording-equipments">https://kit.co/iamahmedkhalifa/video-recording-equipments</a><br /><br />Video edited on Filmora: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hearmeoutcc.com/filmora">https://hearmeoutcc.com/filmora</a><br /><br />Music via Epidemic Sound - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://hearmeoutcc.com/epidemicsound">https://hearmeoutcc.com/epidemicsound</a><br /><br />For more deaf awareness related videos, you can find them here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS6gFyR67zypy_CJpFOuJ3ToagiK3Li04">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLS6gFyR67zypy_CJpFOuJ3ToagiK3Li04</a><br /><br />#HearingPrivilege #HearingAdvantage #DeafAwareness{% endraw %}
