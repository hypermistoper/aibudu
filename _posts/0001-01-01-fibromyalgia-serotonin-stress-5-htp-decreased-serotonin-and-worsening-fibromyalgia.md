{% raw %}Fibromyalgia, Serotonin &amp; Stress | 5-HTP, Decreased Serotonin and Worsening Fibromyalgia Symptoms <br /><br />The etiology of fibromyalgia is still currently unknown. Interestingly, fibromyalgia patients suffer from a slew of symptoms that appear to have a possible underlying cause in common: decreased serotonin. In this lesson, we discuss how levels of serotonin, stress (both physical  like exercise and mental) and changes to immune system functioning may interact to cause and/or worsen fibromyalgia symptoms.<br /><br />Big thank you to Patreon supporter, Melanie Stegman, for making this video possible!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />EXCLAIMER: The content used in this lesson is used in accordance with Fair Use laws and is intended for educational purposes only.<br /><br />**MEDICAL DISCLAIMER**: JJ Medicine does not provide medical advice, and the information available on this channel does not offer a diagnosis or advice regarding treatment.
