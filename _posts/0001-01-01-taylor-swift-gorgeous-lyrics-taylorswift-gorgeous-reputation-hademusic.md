(Oh)<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />You're so gorgeous<br />I can't say anything to your face (To your face)<br />'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)<br />And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)<br />At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)<br />But what can I say? (I say)<br />You're gorgeous<br /><br />[Outro]<br />You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)<br />There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have<br />And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)<br />You're gorgeous<br />You make me so happy it turns back to sad (It turns back to sad)<br />There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have (What I can have)<br /><br /><br />#taylorswift #gorgeous #reputation #hademusic #lyrics<br /><br /><br />Tags:<br />pop songs,best pop songs,pop songs 2021,new pop songs,top songs,pop song,popular songs,english songs,pop music,pop hits,new songs,popular songs 2021,best pop music,pop hits 2021,pop music 2021,pop songs 2020,best songs 2021,pop song 2021,top pop song,english songs 2021,new popular songs,songs 2021,new songs 2021,best songs 2020,best pop hits,pop,pop song 2020,popular songs 2020,latest english songs,songs 2020,2020 songs,top songs 2021,best songs,pop hits 2020,pop best songs,english songs 2020{% endraw %}
