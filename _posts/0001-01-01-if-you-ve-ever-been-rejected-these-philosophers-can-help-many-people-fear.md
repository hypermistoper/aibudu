{% raw %}Many people fear being rejected because they experience it as painful. As a result, they avoid situations in which they could be rejected. And so, they rather not apply for jobs that might be out of their league, avoid asking out a romantic interest when there’s a possibility of refusal (which is always the case), and never ask friends to hang out as they might turn down the offer.<br /><br />But when we fear rejection, what do we fear? Is it the disapproval from other people? And if so, why do we care so much about that? Or could it be that we fear the idea of being inadequate? How to get over rejection? This video explores the experience of rejection and how philosophers (Diogenes, Schopenhauer, Epictetus &amp; Zhuangzi) handle rejection.<br /><br />Support the channel:<br />✔️ PayPal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/einzelgangerco">https://www.paypal.me/einzelgangerco</a><br />✔️ Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster">https://www.patreon.com/einzelgangster</a><br />✔️ Bitcoin: 3HQnEz1LQ4G6dqN2LdZgzc7qoJjJCyWjTC<br />(Donated BTC and want in the credits?
