{% raw %}Yes, we are in the middle of Winter Storm Landon and could not get out to do the Kroger ad this week, so we had to do it slightly different. Our county was in a red travel advisory.<br /><br />Note that we are in the state of Indiana and prices do vary depending on your location. Prices are good from 2/2/22 to 2/8/22.<br /><br />Some of the items we liked was the 5 lbs of Kroger potatoes, half gallon milk, Frito Lay snacks, Lays chips, Land O Lakes butter, Kroger Orange Juice, Tostitos, Ruffles, Coke, Pepsi and 7 Up products, Tyson boneless chicken breasts and more. Some were weekly digital deals and some were buy 5 or more promotion.<br /><br />If you like what we do, please buy us a coffee!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/luvs2travel">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/luvs2travel</a><br /><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/steveandpegluvs2travel">https://www.facebook.com/steveandpegluvs2travel</a><br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/steveandpegluvs2travel/">https://www.instagram.com/steveandpegluvs2travel/</a><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SPluvs2travel">https://twitter.com/SPluvs2travel</a><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />If you would like to send us mail:<br />Attn: Steve and Peg<br />Luvs 2 Travel<br />P.
