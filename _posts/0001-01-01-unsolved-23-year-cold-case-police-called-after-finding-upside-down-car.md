{% raw %}Today I traveled near Great Falls, SC to search for missing person Teresa Shannon. I ran sonar several days earlier and discovered a flipped vehicle in Fishing creek lake and returned with Jeremy to dive and remove it. Teresa went missing in 1999 from Lugoff, SC about thirty minutes away so I believed this could possibly be her vehicle, a 1988 Oldsmobile Cutlass. The visibility was poor and after diving and pulling the plate we called the police to report the vehicle. It ended up being a dumped VW car, not Shannon's but we still removed it from the lake. Huge thanks to Larry's Towing from Great Falls, SC. Please go leave them a 5 star google review!  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/uxALtYdZvva8kxKEA">https://goo.gl/maps/uxALtYdZvva8kxKEA</a><br /><br />Shannon was last seen driving away from Western Sizzlin' Steakhouse at approximately 2:30 PM on February 4, 1999 in Lugoff, South Carolina. She attended a SisterCare meeting with her friend earlier in the day. SisterCare is a support group for battered women. Last seen driving a 1988 Oldsmobile Cutlass plate number 605-CJY.<br /><br />Follow   @Exploring with Nug  <br /><br />Follow me:<br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@adambrownadventures">https://www.tiktok.com/@adambrownadventures</a><br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/AdamBrownAdventures">https://www.instagram.com/AdamBrownAdventures</a><br />Face book: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://biturl.top/QJfEnu">https://biturl.top/QJfEnu</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AdamBAdventures‚Äã">https://twitter.com/AdamBAdventures‚Äã</a><br /><br />Help Support meüëá<br />‚úÖ HELP ME HIT 180,000 SUBSCRIBERS! ‚úÖ<br />- SUBSCRIBE ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://biturl.top/rqqI7b">https://biturl.top/rqqI7b</a><br /><br />Donate here to my GoFundMe and help me get a better boat motor and sonar to search for missing loved ones. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3Hv3aoN">https://bit.ly/3Hv3aoN</a><br /><br />Gear Currently In Need of.
