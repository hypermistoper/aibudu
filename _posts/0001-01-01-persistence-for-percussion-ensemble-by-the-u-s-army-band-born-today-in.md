{% raw %}Born today in 1912, American composer John Cage revolutionized the percussion ensembles of the mid-1930s, bringing percussionists center stage instead of tucked behind the orchestra.  <br /><br />Of his original piece, Staff Sgt. Brian Blume writes, &quot;Cage's work has no doubt had an influence on my composition. Just the idea of creating percussion instruments and musical sounds from pretty much anything.&quot; <br /><br />&quot;Persistence&quot; utilizes industrial equipment and bridges the gap between John Cage’s audiences of the early 1900s and today by providing a crowd-pleasing piece that is equal parts groovy and contemporary. <br /><br />Performers:<br />Staff Sgts. Brian Blume, Jake Harpster, Jonathan Milke, Tim Perry, Peter Soroka<br /><br />Composed by: Staff Sgt. Brian Blume<br /><br />► SUBSCRIBE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR6fLOl9_N1UXVDh4lXjYAw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR6fLOl9_N1UXVDh4lXjYAw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />► ARMY OPPORTUNITIES:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goarmy.com">https://goarmy.com</a><br /><br />Follow Pershing's Own:<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://usarmyband.com">https://usarmyband.com</a><br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/usarmyband">https://youtube.com/usarmyband</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/usarmyband">https://instagram.com/usarmyband</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/usarmyband">https://facebook.com/usarmyband</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/theusarmyband">https://twitter.com/theusarmyband</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/gR6zja8">https://discord.com/invite/gR6zja8</a><br />Flickr: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://flickr.com/usarmyband">https://flickr.com/usarmyband</a><br /><br />#percussion #drumline #armybands{% endraw %}
