{% raw %}NBDs are the benchmark of skateboarding. From his earliest parts ’til now, Chris Cole has logged more visionary, never-been-done (hell, never-been-imagined) tricks than just about anyone. Take a walk down memory lane with Berra and and revisit some of Cole’s most memorable Never Been Done tricks throughout his career.<br /><br />Subscribe to The Berrics: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/TheBerricsYoutube">http://bit.ly/TheBerricsYoutube</a><br /><br />The Berrics was founded by professional skateboarders Steve Berra and Eric Koston in December of 2007. With over 10,000 skateboarding videos under their belt, including Battle at The Berrics, Do A Kickflip and Life on Video, The Berrics is not only one of the most popular online platforms in skate culture but the one of the most famous skate spots in the world. Berra + Eric = Berrics. <br /><br />Daily Videos and More: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://theberrics.com">http://theberrics.com</a><br />Shop our Online Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://canteen.theberrics.com/">https://canteen.theberrics.com/</a><br />Like The Berrics on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fb.com/berrics">http://fb.com/berrics</a><br />Follow The Berrics on Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/berrics">http://instagram.com/berrics</a><br />Follow The Berrics on TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@berrics?">https://www.tiktok.com/@berrics?</a><br />Follow The Berrics on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/berrics">http://twitter.com/berrics</a><br /><br />#Skateboarding #Berrics #TheBerrics #SkateboardingIsFun{% endraw %}
