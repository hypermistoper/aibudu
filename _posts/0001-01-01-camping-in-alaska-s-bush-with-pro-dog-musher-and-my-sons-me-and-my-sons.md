{% raw %}Me and my sons Tommy and Nathan went winter camping in the Alaskan Backcountry with pro dog mushers. The boys got to harness the dogs, learn how to rig a dog sled, drive a dog sled and go 32 miles into the woods with an 8 dog Iditarod team. <br /><br />If you want to do this too check out Way Finder Kennels in Willow Alaska <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wayfinderkennel.com/">https://wayfinderkennel.com/</a><br /><br />Outdoor Boys on FACEBOOK<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TeamOutdoorBoys">https://www.facebook.com/TeamOutdoorBoys</a><br /><br />Outdoor Boys on INSTAGRAM<br />@outdoorboyschannel<br /><br />BUY OUTDOOR BOYS T-SHIRTS<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shop.spreadshirt.com/catsandcarp/">http://shop.spreadshirt.com/catsandcarp/</a>{% endraw %}
