{% raw %}You know, I am not as young as I once was.... but I still think I can do everything!  I mastered the FlowRider on the boogie board, so I thought I could easily handle the stand up board (surfing).  I mean, I skateboarded as a kid and grew up on a lake skiing... how hard could it be???<br /><br />Well, the first time up, I busted my butt!  And my shoulder!  I knew something was wrong immediately but I kept on trying to get it.  <br /><br />After getting home, I saw a doctor and had an MRI on my right shoulder... and needed surgery.  I am a few days post op now after having a rotater cuff repair and am on the mend.  Should I be brave (stupid) and try again???<br /><br />#FlowRider #Injuryonacruise #OdysseyoftheSeas<br /><br /><br /><br />Please SUBSCRIBE, Comment, Like, Share &amp; Follow!<br /><br />*Check out our travel &amp; camera gear on Amazon*<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/eecctravels">https://www.amazon.com/shop/eecctravels</a><br />This link has all of the camera gear we use to create our videos!!<br />Above is an affiliate link which means we receive a percentage of the revenue made from purchasing products via those links.<br /><br />*Support our channel*<br />Become part of our Travel Fam: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/eecctravels">https://www.patreon.com/eecctravels</a><br /><br />*Merch*<br />Get your EECC Travels merch here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/eecc-travels">https://teespring.com/stores/eecc-travels</a><br /><br />*Get our music*<br />Check out our music program Epidemic Sound for thousands of songs for your videos! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/rtknk6/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/rtknk6/</a><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/EECCTravels">https://www.youtube.com/c/EECCTravels</a><br /><br />Also find  us at:<br />EECC Travels Website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://eecctravels.com/">http://eecctravels.com/</a><br />Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/eecctravels/">https://www.instagram.com/eecctravels/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/eecctravels">https://twitter.com/eecctravels</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/EECC-Travels">https://www.facebook.com/EECC-Travels</a><br />Pinterest:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/eecctravels/">https://www.pinterest.com/eecctravels/</a><br />Email: alisa@eecctravels.com<br />Snail Mail: PO Box 12192, Alexandria, LA 71315{% endraw %}
