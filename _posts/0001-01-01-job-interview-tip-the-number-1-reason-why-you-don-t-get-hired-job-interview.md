In doing so, they expend so much energy in the interview focusing on their experience before they know which parts of their experience and qualifications the employer is most interested in. At this point, you must be thinking whaaaaaa?<br /><br />The Obvious<br /><br />You are in a job interview of some kind. The employer, through its action of spending time to speak with you, thinks you‚Äôre qualified‚Äîon paper.<br /><br />The Not-So-Obvious<br /><br />You actually get a job interview because of your qualifications. You get the job for three reasons, none of which are your qualifications.<br /><br />Why Do You Get the Job?<br /><br />Based on my observation from thousands of interviews between my clients (the hiring companies) and job candidates (prospective employees), I've concluded a candidate's attainment of the job is largely contingent on three often-undetectable success factors:<br /><br />‚Ä¢ The candidate's ability to effectively articulate his or her qualifications and potential contributions (encoding)<br />‚Ä¢ The interviewer's ability to accurately interpret the candidate's qualifications (decoding)<br />‚Ä¢ The interviewer's capacity to remember the candidate (memory)<br /><br />It all comes down to your ability to communicate how your qualifications match what the employer needs.<br /><br />The 3-Step Fix<br /><br />1. Keep the three reasons why you get hired in mind. Awareness and consciousness (of these issues) is key to success. Of course, general consciousness is too. ‚ò∫<br /><br />2. When asked an interview question, don‚Äôt rush to share your awesomeness unless you know which part of your awesomeness the interviewer and employer needs to know. (That is, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre fantastic. You need to connect the dots for the employer how your fabulousness matches what it needs!) Sometimes the job interviewer‚Äôs question is specific and he or she identifies clearly what‚Äôs needed. Other times, the interviewer is vague. Make sure to look before you leap.<br /><br />3. Ask a clarifying question (if need be) to zone in on exactly what information the interviewer needs to know to determine whether you are a great fit. This is especially helpful in the wake of the dreaded and horribly ineffective, ‚ÄúPlease tell me about yourself,‚Äù question.
