{% raw %}An introduction to the Courant number in modern Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) codes. The following topics are covered:<br /><br />1) 2:07 How is the Courant Number calculated in 1D?<br /><br />2) 5:41 How is the Courant Number calculated for general 3D cells? <br /><br />3) 17:21 What are the recommended values of Courant Number in CFD? <br /><br />4) 19:51 How does adjustable time stepping work? <br /><br />#CourantNumber #fluidmechanics101 #cfd<br /><br />==============================================<br /><br />Some useful references:<br /><br />1) The Original Paper by Courant, Friedrichs and Lewy (1928).
