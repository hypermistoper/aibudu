{% raw %}Yep, that's right, I put two barrels of rocks on my tumbler and didn't touch them for an entire year. The results were very interesting! This experiment really does a good job of showing the strengths and weaknesses of silicon carbide and aluminum oxide grit.<br /><br />Here are close up pictures of the carnelians from this video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/dGIGfMEwHbY">https://youtu.be/dGIGfMEwHbY</a><br />Close ups of the Bahias are here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9wJL_gtQoZE">https://youtu.be/9wJL_gtQoZE</a><br /><br />Thanks to Christina Jelinek for doing the closed captions for this video.
