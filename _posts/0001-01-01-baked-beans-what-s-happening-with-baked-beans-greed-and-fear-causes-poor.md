{% raw %}Hey All!  In this video I tell you what's going on with Baked Beans and I am doing my best to help the Community to understand how to make Baked Beans a Long Lasting and Sustainable Project.<br />DISCLAIMER:  I am not a Financial Advisor.  Read more below.<br /><br />Here is the link to my website where you can get access to the documents mentioned in the video including the free social media training. <br />👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://earnwithjanice.com/bakedbeansminer">https://earnwithjanice.com/bakedbeansminer</a><br />👉 Baked Beans Website:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cryptobakehouse.com/">https://cryptobakehouse.com/</a><br /><br />Let's pull together as a Community and make this work. <br />(Chapters Below)<br /><br />Please read the Faq's and the Litepaper to fully understand how the Baked Beans Miner works.<br />Please do not join unless you fully understand how it works!  <br /><br />Too many people are jumping in to Baked Beans and all of the copy cat miners, looking for a quick buck.  That is not what the project was built for, people!  The project recommends the 6:1 strategy to help maintain long term sustainability so that we can get a weekly paycheck.  <br /><br />Along with that, members can help by sharing with new people.  We should not just leave it up to YouTubers, and Whales to maintain longevity.  We need to work as a community.  <br /><br />When people start fudding (spreading fear and uncertainty), it breeds fear amongst other members who don't understand or believe in what they have at their fingertips.  It is this fud, that is causing the TVL to go down.  There's nothing fishy going on and there is not now or ever was any  guarantee that we well always earn 8%.  <br /><br />Please Read the FAQ's Below for a full understanding of how the project works and how it can be better sustained.  <br /><br />⚠️ BAKED BEANS dApp MINER BNB REWARDS POOL ⚠️<br /><br />Contract:<br /><br />🟢 Displays TVL (Total Locked Value) of the smart contract miner verifiable here: <br />🟢 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bscscan.com/address/0xE2D26507981A4dAaaA8040bae1846C14E0Fb56bF">https://www.bscscan.com/address/0xE2D26507981A4dAaaA8040bae1846C14E0Fb56bF</a><br /><br />Wallet:<br /><br />🟢 BSC BEP20 connected Metamask | Trust Wallet or Ledger displays personal wallet balance<br /><br />Your Beans:<br /><br />🟢 They are miners hired with BNB (They do not have a set price) that gain your daily rewards<br />🟢 Beans DO NOT have a price, Beans price per BNB fluctuates EVERY min<br />   <br />Bake:<br /><br />🟢 Baked Beans displays blue when a BNB amount is entered into the window just above, click bake to confirm deposit<br />🟢 Gas fees (Standard BSC fees .11c) and a 3% dev fee upon deposit and withdrawal<br /><br />Re-bake:<br /><br />🟢 Minimum re-bake is .01 BNB <br />🟢 If there are rewards accumulated and a new deposit is made ALL BNB gets added to “Your Beans”<br /><br />Eat Beans:<br /><br />🟢 This withdraws BNB accumulated and is transferred into connected personal wallet<br />🟢 Eat fees are BSC gas fees and 3% dev fee<br /><br />Referral:<br /><br />🟢 You need to have invested in the miner for the referral to show<br />🟢 The bonus is 12% of the 3% dev fee (Please see faq doc for further details)<br /><br />Your Rewards:<br /><br />🟢 This displays the amount of BNB accumulated from your Beans over time<br />🟢 This is accumulated as soon as you have deposited<br /><br />Please note:<br /><br />🟢 This This is a locked smart contract | BNB rewards pool your initial investment is locked (forever)<br />🟢 Rewards fluctuate between 1-8% on several factors, incl TVL amount, eating and re-baking habits (*Please see faq doc for detailed info)<br />🟢 Following 6:1 ratio is recommended as a tried and tested way of bean bakers (see faq doc for more info)<br />🟢 There are no time limits or restrictions, re-bake | eat | deposit whenever you like standard gas and dev fees apply<br />🟢 Re-bakes do not show amount on BSCscan<br />🟢 Baked Beans Miner is high risk and high reward<br />🟢 The contract has an anti-whale mechanism (see faq doc for more info)<br />🟢 Baked Beans Miner and* $BCT token are separate projects (*Under the same ecosystem and team)<br />🟢 Please use Rose wisely she has all / filters set and is very handy<br />🟢 DM a Mod or Admin before the founders and devs<br /><br />FOUNDED: NOVEMBER 6TH 2021<br /><br />Video Chapters:  <br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:30 TVL decreasing<br />1:19  Simply Logic<br />2:04  Compounding Spreadsheets<br />2:35  Not the Whales Fault<br />4:25  Your own Fear<br />5:24  Marketing Team <br />5:55 Stop Eating So much!<br />6:25  Maybe I can Help<br />8:30  Baked Beans Resources<br />9:38  Telegram and FAQ's<br />11:35 Understanding Baked Beans<br />13:18  Eating is not helping<br />14:00  Baked Beans Merch<br />15:24 AMA Recordings<br />16:25  Beware of Scammers<br />18:17  New Users Listen Up<br />20:45  Daily Rewards not growing<br />22:00  Bank Interest Rates<br />22:38  Wishing everyone Success<br /><br />⚠️ Disclaimer:  I am not a financial advisor, nor do I recommend how you should spend your money.
