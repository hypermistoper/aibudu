{% raw %}Nord Stream 2 is possibly the world's most controversial infrastructure project, and it was thrust further into the spotlight when Russia invaded Ukraine earlier in 2022. The future of this monumental feat of engineering and maritime construction is unclear. Right now, it seems doubtful that the Nord Stream 2 will ever be anything more than an empty tube of steel and concrete at the bottom of the Baltic Sea (and maybe that’s for the best).<br /><br />Practical Engineering is a YouTube channel about infrastructure and the human-made world around us.
