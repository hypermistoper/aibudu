{% raw %}With Pattaya now relaxing Bar Times slightly, lets take a look away from the Centre of Town to the Famous Soi 6. We also visit Soi 7 and Soi 8 and the world famous Walking Street. <br /><br />All rides filmed in 4K/60FPS by a geriatric old guy who is taking his life in his hands on a Bicycle.
