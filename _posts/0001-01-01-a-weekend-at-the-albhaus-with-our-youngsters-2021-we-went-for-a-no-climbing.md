{% raw %}We went for a no-climbing-weekend to the Albhaus with the youngest of our team. Just playing games, chilling, going for a night-hike and cooking with the kids! <br />But of course we although went a few hours climbing at the nearby Stellfels.<br /><br /><br />What a fantastic weekend it was!<br /><br /><br />______________________________________________________________<br /><br /><br />Our Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/climbingteam.dav.stuttgart/">https://www.instagram.com/climbingteam.dav.stuttgart/</a><br /><br /><br />Our Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://climbingteam.alpenverein-stuttgart.de/wer-wir-sind.html">https://climbingteam.alpenverein-stuttgart.de/wer-wir-sind.html</a>{% endraw %}
