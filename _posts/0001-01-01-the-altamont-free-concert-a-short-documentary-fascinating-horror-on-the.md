{% raw %}On the 6th of December, 1969, 300,000 people gathered at the Altamont Raceway in California for a once-in-a-lifetime free concert that had been promoted as the Woodstock of the West Coast. Unfortunately, many of them would end up remembering the event for all the wrong reasons. Instead of the festival of peace and love that the organisers had envisaged, the Altamont Free Concert ended in a rash of chaos and violence that left four people dead.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:43 - Background<br />04:36 - The Altamont Free Concert<br />09:34 - Aftermath<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery. Fascinating Horror is all about in-depth research, respectful storytelling, and learning what we can from the mistakes of the past. You might be surprised to discover just how much of today's world is shaped by long-forgotten disasters from decades gone by.<br /><br />Music: &quot;Glass Pond&quot; by Public Memory | &quot;Pedal to the Metal&quot; by Chris Haugen<br /><br />► Like, comment and subscribe to keep up with my latest videos<br />► Know of an incident I should cover?
