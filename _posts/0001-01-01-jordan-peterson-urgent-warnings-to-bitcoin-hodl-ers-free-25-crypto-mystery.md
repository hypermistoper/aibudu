Peterson touched on a few topics dear to him, such as entrepreneurship, the state of totalitarianism, and the ‘too big to fail’ myth.  But when it came to discussing Bitcoin, Peterson took a different approach.  While most of the Keynote speakers delivered on the optimism and potential of Bitcoin, Peterson looked at it differently.  He didn’t take a pessimistic or bearish look, but more of a cautionary perspective on Bitcoin.  He pondered many questions such as “what if this doesn’t work as we plan it?” and “what if this is irreversible?”  Many Bitcoin bulls and maxis might think of Peterson’s line of thinking as preposterous, but it’s an interesting, somewhat outside perspective, that deserves a listen. <br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />THIS INTERVIEW WAS POSTED ON APRIL 7, 2022<br />Listen to the full unedited interview here ⬇ [Credits] 🙏<br />Jordan Peterson Fireside Chat - Bitcoin 2022 Conference<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvpXn-Iki8o&amp;t=1608s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvpXn-Iki8o&amp;t=1608s</a><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />🎵BACKGROUND MUSIC licensed through AudioJungle &amp; Epidemic Sound <br /><br />🎥FOOTAGE licensed through VideoBlocks and Filmpac, except parts about the topic that have been used under fair use.<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />FAIR-USE COPYRIGHT DISCLAIMER <br />Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, commenting, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
