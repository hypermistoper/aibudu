{% raw %}NOTE FROM TED: This talk contains a discussion of abortion which represents the speaker's personal views. TEDx events are independently organized by volunteers. The guidelines we give TEDx organizers are described in more detail here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_content_guidelines.pdf">http://storage.ted.com/tedx/manuals/tedx_content_guidelines.pdf</a><br /><br />Reproduction, pregnancy and abortion are seen as 'women only issues' and Amanda Bradley asks the very important question, 'Why?'. A leader in the non-for-profit and public health sector with her work for Children by Choice, Amanda examines the impact our attitudes towards reproductive health have on equality.<br /><br />Amanda Bradley has worked in leadership roles in the not-for-profit and public health sectors for over ten years. She is continually motivated to find solutions that create success for all stakeholders and is always up for complex situations and addressing wicked problems.<br /><br /><br /><br />We live in complicated times. Not-for-profits are being squeezed to deliver more for less. Amanda believes we have to be able to respond with innovative approaches that enable us to do this – it is essential to be able to describe the successes we have in ways that are meaningful. She says we need to collaborate and find methods of meeting the needs of consumers (clients) that is responsive, timely and accessible in a constantly changing environment.<br /><br /><br /><br />Amanda prefers to spend time making sure all her ducks are in a row before she leaps off the cliff – with the parachute that she’s triple checked.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
