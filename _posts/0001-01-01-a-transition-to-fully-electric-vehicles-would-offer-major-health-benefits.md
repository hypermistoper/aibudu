{% raw %}A new report from the American Lung Association (ALA) says a nationwide transition to zero-emission vehicles would have a dramatic impact on the air quality in Pennsylvania.<br /><br /><br /><br />Molly Pisciottano, the director of advocacy at the ALA, says the organization developed certain guidelines to measure an all-electric scenario. <br /><br /><br /><br />â€œThe Lung Association envisioned a scenario where 100% of new passenger vehicle sales would be electric by 2035 and where trucks, buses and other heavy duty categories would achieve 100% electric in sales by 2040,&quot; she explained. <br /><br /><br /><br />Pisciottano said this transition would dramatically reduce pollutants that cause and exacerbate a variety of health issues such as COPD and asthma.<br /><br /><br /><br />According to the report, this would avoid nearly 8,000 deaths and 148,000 asthma attacks in Pennsylvania: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fox43.com/article/news/health/electric-vehicles-cars-evs-health-benefits-air-pollution-report/521-bd6512fd-0ac7-4e62-82a8-9d3f8f1c7b1d">https://www.fox43.com/article/news/health/electric-vehicles-cars-evs-health-benefits-air-pollution-report/521-bd6512fd-0ac7-4e62-82a8-9d3f8f1c7b1d</a>{% endraw %}
