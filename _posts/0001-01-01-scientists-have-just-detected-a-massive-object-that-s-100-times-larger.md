{% raw %}Scientists have just detected a massive object that's 100 times larger than the Milky Way Galaxy. Today, we take a look at what scientists found out in space.<br /><br />Space is a marvel. Countless things are hidden within the great unknown, so much to discover, to learn, to find. As the human race, we are so determined to find all there possibly is to find; knowledge has always been the moving factor that has kept us going throughout the centuries.<br /><br />Space is, needless to say, massive. Recently, astronomers uncovered a radio galaxy so colossal, it overshadows our own Milky Way by a shocking one hundred times in size.<br /><br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />Thank you to CO.AG for the background music!{% endraw %}
