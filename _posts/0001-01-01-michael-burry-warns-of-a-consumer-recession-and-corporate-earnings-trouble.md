{% raw %}Michael Burry has warned of a 'consumer recession' and headwinds for corporate earnings. He has noted that personal savings rates have declined but credit card debt is increasing.

I discuss Michael Burry's predictions and whether Michael Burry is correct to note significant issues with consumer wealth and corporate profits. <br /><br />* 30% off Simply Wall St Analysis &amp; Data: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://simplywall.st/?via=mark">https://simplywall.st/?via=mark</a><br />*Check out my substack: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://financemark.substack.com/">https://financemark.substack.com/</a><br />* Skillshare: Get a month of free access: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.skillshare.com/r/profile/Professor-Mark/657649567?gr_tch_ref=on&amp;gr_trp=on">https://www.skillshare.com/r/profile/Professor-Mark/657649567?gr_tch_ref=on&amp;gr_trp=on</a><br />* Sharesight: Get a month free and a free trial: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sharesight.com/financemark">https://www.sharesight.com/financemark</a> <br /><br />Books<br />* Investment Valuation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2LUwYQW">https://amzn.to/2LUwYQW</a>  <br />* Venture Capital &amp; Private Equity:  [US] <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3l1oTvs">https://amzn.to/3l1oTvs</a> .
