It's a tough hill, at least for us muppets. Not a lot of run up. Steep. Tree roots. Then the second half can't be done at speed. It needs pivot turns, jumping up tree roots. Can we get up? First is Jeff. It looks good, standing and leaning forward, but backs off the throttle. It takes ages to get back down when it's this steep. Scott is next. We all have to psych ourselves up, it's very intimidating when you look up at this beast. Listen to Scott feathering the clutch to keep the 200 in the powerband. Amazing run. Lets see that again. Great clutch work, standing on the footpegs, great body positioning. Jeff again. It's all about a great start, he knows he fluffed that one. Second gear. Not enough revs, and he's heading for the tree roots. I ditch filming in case he falls down the hill. <br />Much better run, leg paddling for balance but still standing. Excellent. Gulp. My turn. I will sit due to my spine injury. Right up the front of the seat to prevent wheelies. Second gear. Revs high and feed in the power. Then it's time for the difficult pivot turns and jumping up little ledges. In loose soil, it takes very little to dig big holes and ruin the track fast. So I push the bike if the traction isn't good. Big jump up a tree roots here. Seat bouncing just isn't good enough, time to push again. We are jealous of how fast Scott got up this climb with a 200cc bike. He bought the smaller bike as it would force him to learn better clutch skills. It seems to be working. Lets see how Jeff is going. He has got up to the first pivot turn point. He's being very careful. It's still quite steep here. There's a chance the bike could go cartwheeling to the bottom. Very loose soil. Like me, instead of digging a hole Jeff just gets off the bike to push it across.<br />It's easy for a wheel to slide out on this off camber bit. Good seat bounce for traction. <br />That poor old clutch has had a good workout on this hill. <br />To get up this tree root, Jeff opts for the static zap. I badly need to practice this after my mine months off the bike. <br />Hopefully you can learn from our mistakes and the occasional bit we get right too.
