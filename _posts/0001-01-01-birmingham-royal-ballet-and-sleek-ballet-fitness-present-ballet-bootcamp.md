{% raw %}This 20-minute, continuous ballet barre workout with Sleek Technique has been inspired by our wonderful new production of Don Quixote. It is fantastic for shaping a lean, toned lower body in express time. Working fluidly and incorporating stretches whilst still building to a Bootcamp pace means you increase your heart rate, burn calories and develop stronger, lengthened muscles without any bulking. <br /><br />Birmingham Royal Ballet Principal CÃ©line Gittens joins former BRB dancer and co-founder of sleekballetfitness.com, Victoria Marr, to take you through this ballerina-style workout that can easily be done from home. There is no equipment necessary, just grab a chair to act as a barre and start getting Sleek! This workout can be done daily. We recommend no less than three times per week.<br /><br />Love this video? Look out for two more fantastic workouts in this Don Quixote-inspired series.
