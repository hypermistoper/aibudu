{% raw %}Ok so if you watched the video you would know that I said shrimp paste is optional and I mean it. If that triggers your inner Indonesian/Pan-Asian heritage, hear me out. I want everyone to make this dish because it's unreal. The funk factor is off the charts with shrimp paste and is so niche that sourcing it might breed resentment once someone smells up their house with it for the only recipe they'll likely ever use it in. Ok rant over. Love all my homies. Especially the ones who show me love on Ko-Fi and help support my grocery shopping <br /><br />Here's where you could do the same.. if you were cool ;) (I'll love you either way)<br />Ko-fi.com/wolfgangpanicali<br /><br />Recipe Notes: <br />3 Cups Day Old Rice (or same day if dried uncovered on a tray in your fridge)<br />3-4 Cloves Garlic<br />.5 Medium Onion<br />1 Fresno Chili<br />1 Chicken Breast<br />High Smoke Point Oil<br /><br />Sauce:<br />1.5 Kecap Manis<br />1 Tbs Soy Sauce (Kikkoman Used)<br /><br />Garnishes:<br />Hothouse Cucumber <br />Tomato<br />Sambal Oelek{% endraw %}
