{% raw %}Russian President Vladimir Putin sent a congratulatory message to the leaders of the former Soviet countries on May 9 Victory Day. 'Our common task today is to prevent the revival of Nazism, which has caused so much pain to the peoples of different countries,' Putin said in his message. As the war in Ukraine continues at full speed, Putin's highly anticipated May 9 message was released. According to a statement on the Kremlin's website, the message penned by Putin on the 77th anniversary of the Soviet Victory was sent to the leaders of the former Soviet countries. &quot;Our common task today is to prevent the revival of Nazism, which caused so much pain to the peoples of different countries,&quot; Putin said in his message, stressing that it is unacceptable for the ideological followers of those defeated in this war to take revenge. Putin also celebrated the victory day of the peoples of Ukraine and Georgia, both former Soviet Republics. Preparations are underway at full speed in Russia, which is preparing to celebrate its victory over Nazi Germany. Yesterday, a costumed rehearsal of the military parade was held in Moscow. Thousands of soldiers and heavy weapons such as intercontinental Ballistic Missiles demonstrated in the Moscow administration while military aircraft flew demonstration flights spraying smoke in the colors of the Russian flag.{% endraw %}
