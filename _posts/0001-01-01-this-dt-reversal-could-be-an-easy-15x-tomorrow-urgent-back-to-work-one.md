{% raw %}Back to work – one day left!<br /><br />We’re bullish going into Thursday, so I'm looking for pullbacks and breakouts – but this “hidden” double-top reversal is the trade I really want!<br /><br />Emini and Nasdaq are bullish, but look closely – we’re trading into major resistance with ranges (magnets) below.  I'll be happy with a breakout, but I'm praying we get this reversal!<br /><br />Crude Oil is bullish too – I'd love to see another range overnight so I can scalp both sides of this market.  If not, keep this bull breakout on your radar…<br /><br />Don’t forget – markets closed on Friday, let’s finish the week strong!<br />--------------------<br />Learn my Favorite Entry Patterns w/ my Free Trading Course<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.schooloftrade.com/trial">http://www.schooloftrade.com/trial</a><br /><br />Join the Trade Room every morning @ 8:00am EST:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.schooloftrade.com/">http://www.schooloftrade.com/</a> <br /><br />More Trading Videos on our Blog:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sidewaysmarkets.com/">http://www.sidewaysmarkets.com/</a><br /><br />Contact the office for more information:<br />Email:   Sales@SchoolOfTrade.com<br />Phone: 800.381.2084<br />Skype:  Megan.James12345<br /><br />----------------------------------------------<br />Economic News:<br />Please remember that economic news, both scheduled and un-scheduled will increase volatility and decrease liquidity in the market in the short-term, which causes price-action to react inconsistently with the levels of support and resistance mentioned in this video.  Trading during economic news reports is dangerous and highly discouraged, no matter what your level of experience.<br />----------------------------------------------<br />Joseph James, SchoolOfTrade.com and United Business Servicing, Inc. are not registered investment or trading advisers.
