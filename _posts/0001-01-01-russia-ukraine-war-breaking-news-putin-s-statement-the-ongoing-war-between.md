{% raw %}The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine has entered Dec Dec 54th day, while tensions between Russia and Western states continue to rise. As Western states are trying to bring Russia to its knees with sanctions, statements have come from the Russian leader Putin that cause bewilderment. Putin claimed that the sanctions imposed by the Westerners had been reversed and that they had shot themselves. Russian President Vladimir Putin made a number of critical statements during a live economic assessment meeting. Speaking about the Western world's sanctions against Russia, Putin said that his country had begun to circumvent this process, and that the West, which is trying to stop Russia by imposing sanctions, had been hit by its own weapon. Russian President Vladimir Putin held a meeting with the government and economic staffs via video conference. In the opening speech of the meeting, Putin's Russia sanctions by Western countries by evaluating these efforts are unsuccessful, who argues that, “in the last period of the most important negative factor for the economy, it is obvious that the pressure of new sanctions from Western countries. Their account was to quickly undermine the financial and economic situation in our country, cause panic in the markets and the collapse of the banking system, and lead to a large-scale shortage of products in stores. But we can already say with certainty that the sanctions against Russia have failed,” he said.{% endraw %}
