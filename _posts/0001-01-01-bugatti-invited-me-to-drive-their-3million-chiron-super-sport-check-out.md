{% raw %}Check out my podcast, Behind The Glass (The UK's Number 1 Automotive Podcast)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/BehindTheGlass">https://www.youtube.com/BehindTheGlass</a><br /><br />I get an incredible invitation from Bugatti to visit their headquarters in Molsheim, France and drive their most powerful Chiron yet, the 300mph, £3million Super Sport!<br /><br />From Bugatti:<br />With a low-slung front, special aerodynamic shape at the sides and an extended rear for peak<br />performance, it is clear at first sight that the new Bugatti has been<br />designed without compromise for optimal aerodynamic performance. Bugatti engineers<br />developed the new hyper sports car for top speed while fully embracing both luxury and<br />comfort.<br /><br />At speeds over 420 km/h, a vehicle must offer sufficient downforce alongside minimal drag. “Our aim was to give the vehicle a neutral setup at its top speed while also giving it as streamlined a shape as possible.” explains Frank Heyl, Deputy Design Director at Bugatti. The uplift forces exerted on the bodywork at 440 km/h are immense. The body of the Chiron Super Sport generates massive downforce to counter this uplift and perfectly balance the forces. “The design process was therefore in particular about achieving aerodynamic efficiency,” Heyl continues. The Chiron Super Sport’s extended rear, which is known as a long tail, gives it new proportions and very distinctive aesthetics. An optional, new, horizontal color split visually extends the proportions of the Chiron Super Sport even further, making the hyper sports car appear even lower.<br /><br />Bugatti thoroughly overhauled the 8.0-liter W16 engine for the Chiron Super Sport, boosting its performance by 100 PS to 1,176 kW/1,600 PS. At the same time, the vehicle weight was reduced by a further 23 kilograms. The engineers made modifications to the turbochargers, oil pump, and cylinder head with valve train, as well as to the transmission and clutch. “We increased the revolutions per minute (RPM) for even greater longitudinal acceleration and an even more emotive driving experience,” says Michael Kodra, Head of Drive Development a Bugatti. The engine’s rpm was increased by 300 to up to 7,100 rpm, for noticeably increased agility. 1,60 newton meters of torque is now accessible from between 2,000 and 7,000 rpm, rather than up to 6,000 rpm. With the improved performance created by larger turbochargers with more efficient compressor wheels, the seven-gear dual-clutch transmission at full load and full speed transitions from sixth to seventh gear at 403 km/h. The Chiron Super Sport accelerates from 0 to 200 km/h in 5.5 seconds and to 300 km/h in 12.1 seconds. The Chiron Super Sport accelerates from 0 to 400 km/h 12 percen quicker than a Chiron. Seventh gear boasts 3.6 percent longer transmission<br /><br />For all things Seen Through Glass, visit my website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://seenthroughglass.online/">http://seenthroughglass.online/</a><br /><br />----<br />Thinking of financing a car?
