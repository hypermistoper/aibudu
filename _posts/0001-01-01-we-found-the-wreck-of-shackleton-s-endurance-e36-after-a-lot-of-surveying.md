{% raw %}After a lot of surveying and with quite some luck, we finally were able to locate the Wreck of Shackleton's Ship the Endurance under the sea ice in the Weddell Sea. The right combination of skill and luck brought us to this point and I hope you all enjoy the footage!<br />#Endurance22{% endraw %}
