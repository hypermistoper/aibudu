{% raw %}I have 3 tips to dealing with resistance to resolution. Resistance to resolution is when a young person is not compliant with the ideas or strategies you offer that would obviously make their lives better!<br /><br />Sometimes this happens not because the young person is resistant to improving themselves (no one really enjoys being unhappy) but sometimes because they are resisting you, rather than the plan!<br /><br />Have you ever said ‘no' to something that was probably in your best interests out of principal or stubbornness? Well this is similar!<br /><br />If you’d like to find out how to handle resistance to resolution, make sure you watch this video!<br /><br /><br />---------------------------------------------***----------------------------------------------<br /><br />SNAPCHAT - NLP4Kids<br />Subscribe to my Channel here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/NLP4Kids">http://www.youtube.com/NLP4Kids</a>  <br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/NLP4Kids.org">https://www.facebook.com/NLP4Kids.org</a>  <br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/nlp4kids">http://instagram.com/nlp4kids</a>  <br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/NLP4Kids">https://twitter.com/NLP4Kids</a>{% endraw %}
