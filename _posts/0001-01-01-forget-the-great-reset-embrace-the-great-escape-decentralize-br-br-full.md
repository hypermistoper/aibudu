It is our defining moment.&quot; <br /><br />Those are the words of Klaus Schwab, head of the World Economic Forum (WEF), in COVID-19: The Great Reset, the 2020 book he co-authored with Thierry Malleret. <br /><br />&quot;Many of us are pondering when things will return to normal,&quot; they write in the book's introduction. &quot;The short response is: never.&quot;<br /><br />At the latest WEF meeting in Davos, Switzerland, this January, Schwab set the tone for the conference with his glowing introduction of the opening speaker: Xi Jinping, China's president and chairman of the Chinese Communist Party <br /><br />&quot;Major economies should see the world as one community… and should coordinate the objectives, intensity, and pace of fiscal and monetary policies,&quot; said Xi in his address to the WEF.  <br /><br />This vision of a united globe with a coordinated economy managed by experts captures Schwab's vision of the post-COVID world. &quot;We have to redefine the social contract,&quot; said Schwab at a 2020 WEF book launch event for The Great Reset. <br /><br />These grand proclamations, the ominous book title, and Schwab's odd personal style have led many people to speculate that the &quot;great reset&quot; is part of a conspiracy of global financial elites and politicians to depopulate the planet so that they can more easily institute one-world government, or even that COVID was engineered to that end. <br /><br />I don't buy it. Far-reaching, global conspiracies require levels of coordination and shared purpose likely to be quickly exposed and fall apart, especially in the networked age. Instead of spinning our wheels searching for a secret agenda, take a look at the one right out in the open.  <br /><br />&quot;I think we are moving from short-term to long-term, from shareholder capitalism to stakeholder capitalism,&quot; said Schwab at his 2020 book event.<br /><br />What Xi, the WEF, and people like Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.) have in common is that they favor so-called stakeholder capitalism, which is a euphemism for making companies answer first to special interests. They want to reorganize corporate boards to include representatives from labor, environmental, and social justice groups. Warren proposed a bill to require 40 percent of large corporate board seats be elected by workers. In China, the state simply owns or controls a majority stake in most of the country's largest firms.<br /><br />Written and produced by Zach Weissmueller, animation by Tomasz Kaye, additional graphics by Nodehaus<br /><br />Photos: CHINE NOUVELLE/SIPA/Newscom; CHINE NOUVELLE/SIPA/Newscom; Li Tao / Xinhua News Agency/Newscom; Ken Cedeno / Pool via CNP / SplashNews; Ahmad Abdo/dpa/picture-alliance/Newscom;  Ed Lefkowicz / VWPics/Newscom;  Albin Lohr-Jones/Sipa USA/Newscom; Li Xiang / Xinhua News Agency/Newscom; Kyodo/Newscom; CHINE NOUVELLE/SIPA/Newscom;  Li Tao / Xinhua News Agency/Newscom;  Lan Hongguang / Xinhua News Agency/Newscom<br /><br />Stock footage: Timo Volz from Pexels; Alexander Bobrov from Pexels <br /><br />Music: &quot;Thunder&quot; by straget licensed under Creative Commons Attribution; &quot;Aqueous Pulse&quot; by thatjeffcarter licensed under Creative Commons Attribution.{% endraw %}
