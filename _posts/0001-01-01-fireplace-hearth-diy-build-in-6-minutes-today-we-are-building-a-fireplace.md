{% raw %}Today, we are building a fireplace hearth base for a freshly restored Intrepid II wood burning stove by Vermont Castings.  We decided to build our own hearth after searching eBay, Amazon, and local stores in hopes of finding a deal we would feel comfortable agreeing upon.  After our initial time spent looking, we came to the decision to move forward building our own, knowing it would be made for heavy duty application while also using quality building materials.<br /><br />Materials we used for this build were standard 2x4s, 2 1/2 - 3 inch torx wood screws, a small drill bit, battery powered drill, skill saw, miter saw, and 2 saw horses.<br /><br />We spent about $17 dollars on the 2x4s at Menards and $26 on a sheet of 4x8 OSB.  Total cost all in of about $50.00 for this fireplace hearth.  This specific part of the build does not include finishing's such as bricks, pavers, etc.<br /><br />Total time into this build was about 5 hours, which I can attribute to the fact that I am not a professional carpenter.  Remember, you can do this if you are wanting to.. 1 step at a time and ensure you have the tool(s) to do the work.  Tools have made a big difference in our little 2 stall garage.  As always, be safe when working on any project.  We don't want you to get hurt, at the same time, follow your hopes, dreams, and plans.  Remember, you can do this.<br /><br />Thanks for watching.
