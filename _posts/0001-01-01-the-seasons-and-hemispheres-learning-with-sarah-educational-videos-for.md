And that each one of them has different weather conditions. <br />-<br /><br />In winter, itâ€™s very cold<br />In spring, temperatures start to rise, and of course, flowers start to blossom. <br />In summer, itâ€™s usually extremely hot<br />And, in autumn, temperatures start to decrease, and leaves start falling from trees. <br />-<br /><br />Butâ€¦ Did you know that the seasons donâ€™t happen at the same time all over the world?<br />Nope! they donâ€™t, so letâ€™s find out why!<br />-<br /><br />Planet Earth, has an axis, an imaginary line, where the earth spins around itself, in a rotational movement. <br />-<br />This axis is not up straight, itâ€™s actually leaning, and depending on the month of the year, there are areas that receive more heat than others. <br />-<br /><br />Our planet is also divided into two parts, separated by an imaginary line called equator. <br />This line, divides the earth into two hemispheres: the Northern Hemisphere, and the Southern Hemisphere. <br />-<br />Now, letâ€™s see how our planet moves around the sun. <br />Itâ€™s what we call a translation movement. <br />-<br />As you can see, the sun heats the Earth, but not equally around the whole world. <br />Letâ€™s stop the planet. Stop! <br /><br />In this position, the northern hemisphere has more sun rays, because of the axis inclination. <br />And that meansâ€¦ Weâ€™re in summer! And meanwhile, in the southern hemisphere itâ€™s winter. <br />buff I prefer summer!  <br />-<br /><br />But, what happens if the Earth rotates on the other side of the sun? <br />Well, there would be more rays in the southern hemisphere, meaning that in the northern hemisphere, itâ€™s winter, and in the southern hemisphere, itâ€™s summer.<br /><br />Easy peasy huh?<br /><br />Goodbye happy friends! See you next time! <br /><br />I hope youâ€™re always ready to learn! <br /><br />Goodbye!{% endraw %}
