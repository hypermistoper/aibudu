Pilgrims are also those who worship Orthodox shrines and read their prayers before them.<br />Orthodox believer's life initially includes a pilgrimage to the main shrines. That often becomes a starting point of the path to God for many people needing spiritual guidance. Many believers make pilgrimage tours to touch the holy shrines, be spiritually healed while visiting monasteries, and meet with like-minded believers today as many centuries ago. The geography and the number of pilgrimage routes are constantly increasing.<br />Andcross Orthodox Arts Corporation is continually growing and expanding its services, and we are pleased to invite you to visit our newly opening professional photo studio website at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.andcross.art.">https://www.andcross.art.</a><br /><br />We are on the Internet:<br />Orthodox Art Corporation Andcross<br /><br />We are on the Internet:<br />➧ Web Site - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.andcross.ee">https://www.andcross.ee</a><br />➧ Store - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.andcross.eu">https://www.andcross.eu</a><br />➧ Art Studio Andcross - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.andcross.art">https://www.andcross.art</a> <br />➧ Store Etsy - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/AndcrossArtStore">https://www.etsy.com/shop/AndcrossArtStore</a><br />➧ Facebook - www.facebook.com/OrthodoxArtCorporationAndcross/ <br />➧ E-mail – store@andcross.eu <br />➧ Phone  +37256270981 <br /><br />Our channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIcbhN3GXo1SPPw1x4i-KCQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIcbhN3GXo1SPPw1x4i-KCQ</a>{% endraw %}
