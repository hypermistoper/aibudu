{% raw %}&quot;I don't give a rat's heinie what you think.&quot; <br /><br />My favorite moments from Pickles, played to perfection by the great Jean Smart in the severly underrated show The Oblongs (2001). Also I don't own any of these clips and I'll willingly take the video down if someone wants me to.{% endraw %}
