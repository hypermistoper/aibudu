{% raw %}Dealing with difficult employees is unavoidable. But the good news is that taking the time to deal with a difficult employee can have a dramatically positive effect on the team. According to Harvard Business School professors Michael Housman and Dylan Minor, the productivity boost gained from removing toxic employees is greater than any boost gained from adding a star performer. <br /><br />In this episode, we’ll lay out a five-step process to help deal with a difficult employee.<br /><br />0:00 Introduction<br />1:57 Identify The Problem<br />3:46 Examine It Closer<br />4:51 Give Direct Feedback<br />5:45 Explain The Consequences<br />6:55 Document Everything<br />9:07 Conclusion<br /><br />While these five steps may make the process easier, dealing with difficult employees is hard. It’s difficult and its’s draining. So, remember to give yourself some grace as well. No one handles it perfectly, and good leaders likely don’t want to become good at this part of their job. But it can’t be ignored. If it is, it will fester and infect the team. But if it is dealt with, it’ll improve the morale and performance of the team. It will help that difficult employee and the whole team do their best work ever.<br /><br /><br />//DO YOUR BEST WORK EVER<br />If you liked this video and you want to help your team do their best work ever, check out the free resources we've compiled at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://davidburkus.com/resources">https://davidburkus.com/resources</a><br /><br />//LIKE THE SHIRT?<br />Get yours at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shopdavidburkus.com">https://shopdavidburkus.com</a><br /><br />//ABOUT DAVID<br />One of the world’s leading business thinkers, David Burkus’ forward-thinking ideas and bestselling books are helping leaders and teams do their best work ever.<br /><br />He is the best-selling author of four books about business and leadership.
