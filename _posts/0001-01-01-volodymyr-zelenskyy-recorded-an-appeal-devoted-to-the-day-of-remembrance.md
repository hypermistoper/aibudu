{% raw %}&quot;This year, we say &quot;Never again&quot; differently. We hear &quot;Never Again&quot; differently. It sounds painful, cruel. Without an exclamation, but with a question mark. You say: never again? Tell Ukraine about it. Eternal honor to all who opposed Nazism! Eternal memory to all those killed during the Second World War!&quot;{% endraw %}
