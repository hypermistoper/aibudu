{% raw %}!! This MAP contains gore, cartoon animal death, and light flashing. Viewer discretion is advised. !!<br /><br />Wow! After a year of production, this beast is finally complete!! First of all, I wanna thank all the participants. You were all amazing and patient with me, and you did incredible work! You should all be proud! Second, I want to thank @gaLEMtido for her help. Without her, this would have likely taken even longer to come out. Thank you Alex for everything you helped out with [the editing of the credits]! Lastly, remember that some of this art is a year old! Please go check out the participants' channels to see their new work!<br /><br />Playlist with seperate parts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpkSxA1vLXYKLnVwG4TokAXHPiDrGnKuM">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpkSxA1vLXYKLnVwG4TokAXHPiDrGnKuM</a><br /><br />1- Ham☆<br />2- Ham☆<br />3- Ham☆<br />4- OcelotStarZ<br />5- gaLEMtido<br />6- gaLEMtido<br />7- gaLEMtido<br />8- Shrimpz<br />9- avazorous<br />10- Huntress Lilly<br />11- Red Pika<br />12- Red Pika<br />13- aesthetic cherri<br />14- Clover Étoile<br />15- Ayla Draws<br />16- Ayla Draws<br />17- Mink_Nix<br />18- Mink_Nix<br />19- OceanPawz<br />20- galemtido<br />21- Wonder Warrior<br />22- Wonder Warrior<br />23- Cynthic<br />24- AdriLovesGames<br />25- Auggxstt<br />26- [-Robin-]<br />27- [-Robin-]<br />28- TøXîC MÏND<br />29- TøXîC MÏND<br />30- Flarethefiredragon<br />31- Kea<br />32- Water Splash<br />33- Water Splash<br />34- kylaa_drawz<br />35- Bericias<br /><br />And the thumbnail is by yours truly!
