We’ve heard conflicting recommendations on everything from how to prevent the spread, reduce the severity, and recover, but many people are still unsure of which actions make the most impact. To me, a key underlying issue of the pandemic is that we aren’t addressing the health of the host.

Dr. Seheult is quadruple board-certified in Internal Medicine, Pulmonary Diseases, Critical Care Medicine, and Sleep Medicine through the American Board of Internal Medicine. He is also the co-founder of MedCram, an online medical education company that helps healthcare professionals and laypeople understand medical topics clearly.<br /><br />This episode is brought to you by Thrive Market, Rupa Health, and Eight Sleep.<br /><br />Thrive Market is an online, membership-based grocery store that makes eating well convenient and more affordable.
