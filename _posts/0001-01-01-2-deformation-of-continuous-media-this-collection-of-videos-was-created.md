{% raw %}This collection of videos was created about half a century ago to explain fluid mechanics in an accessible way for undergraduate engineering and physics students. I find that no other series of videos has explained the basics of fluid mechanics better than this one by the National Committee for Fluid Mechanics (those national committees gotta be good for something...)<br /><br />As such, I have uploaded these videos here for the benefit of students and interested laypersons. I do not own the copyright and these videos were not made by me. If anyone should want me to take them down, I will comply without complaint.<br /><br />If you want scans of the printed notes that go along with these videos, check out them out over at the MIT side of things: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://web.mit.edu/hml/notes.html.">http://web.mit.edu/hml/notes.html.</a> They are really great stuff.{% endraw %}
