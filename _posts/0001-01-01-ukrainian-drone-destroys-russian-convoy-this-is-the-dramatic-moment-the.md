{% raw %}This is the dramatic moment the Ukrainian military used a drone to destroy a Russian convoy from above. <br /><br />Footage of Turkish-made drones hitting Putin’s forces has been posted online as Ukraine fights back against Russian invasion. <br /><br />Chief commander of the armed forces Valery Zaluzhny posted the clip on Facebook, saying a Bayraktar drone was used near the city of Malryn, around 60 miles northwest of Kyiv. <br /><br />The black and white clip appears to show a row of stationary trucks before an explosive blast in the middle of the line.<br />Zaluzhny wrote: “Welcome to hell!” when he posted the footage. <br /><br />Like many commentators I was surprised (and heartened) to see a video of a drone strike carried out by Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 drones against a Russian supply convoy. Unlike some such videos this one seems to be genuine according to Rob Lee, senior researcher at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. The Ukrainian Air Force has since confirmed it has carried out such attacks; another video can be seen here. This simply could not happen if Russia was conducting its military operations properly, and points to a series of failings in the Russian war machine. <br /><br />To rewind slightly: the Turkish-made Bayraktar TB2 – ‘Tactical Block 2’ — is approximately equivalent to the old U.S. Predator drone. It has a wingspan of 39 feet and a 105-hp engine giving it a cruising speed of around 80 mph, so it could easily be outflown by WW1 fighters. It is highly affordable — less than a tenth the cost of a frontline jet — and like the Predator before it, the TB2 is intended to operate in uncontested airspace, using its 27-hour endurance to patrol and gather intelligence for an extended period<br /><br />IMPORTANT!<br />None of these images, music &amp; video clips were created/owned by us.<br />This video is purely fan-made, if you (owners) have seen your content and want to remove this video, please message us privately or mail us : (edisonamarildo1991@gmail.com) before doing anything.
