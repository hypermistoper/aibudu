{% raw %}Join us services at Founded in Truth this Saturday, March 26th, at 11:00 EST. We are excited to join together in collective worship as well as dive into this week's Torah portion.<br /><br /> Christians who strive to obey God’s Law are often met with criticism and accusations of trying to work their way into Heaven, but that is not always the case.  We believe that the Christian pursuit of obedience to God’s Law is an outgrowth of our faith, not the root of our faith. We believe that Christian obedience to God’s Law is important for many reasons—the greatest of which being that Christ explicitly taught faithful obedience to his Law in his Sermon on the Mount. This sermon examines the passages in question (Matt 5:17-20) in an effort to communicate to the Church what Christ communicated to his audience—that he came not to abolish God’s Law, but to fulfill it in himself and teach us how to do the same. If you have ever been interested in Pronomian Christianity what it means to be a Torah Observant Christian, this message will be a great resource. <br /><br />If you have ever asked the question, &quot;why do we not follow the laws of the old testament?&quot;, then this Pronomian Christian perspective may help give the answer. Many Christians struggle with trying to understand where the old testament laws fit into their faith. Join us as we explore the words of Jesus Himself concerning this question.<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE for the latest content and updates from Founded in Truth ➔ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/foundedintruthfellowship?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/foundedintruthfellowship?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Watch more content like this from Founded in Truth<br /><br />Torah Portion - Every Sunday ➔ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4E9PuNFbr5nbzDnmEX_WO82BTX3AT3b6">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4E9PuNFbr5nbzDnmEX_WO82BTX3AT3b6</a><br /><br />FITBITS - Every Tuesday ➔ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4E9PuNFbr5mWycbS5qvfiLg1M3-rGI-M">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4E9PuNFbr5mWycbS5qvfiLg1M3-rGI-M</a><br /><br />Church Service FULL MESSAGES - Every Saturday ➔ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4E9PuNFbr5kOs81QMzyRJLGgpdzF0eMB">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4E9PuNFbr5kOs81QMzyRJLGgpdzF0eMB</a><br /><br />--For more information about Founded in Truth Fellowship, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.foundedintruth.com">http://www.foundedintruth.com</a><br /><br />Follow FIT across the web!<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/foundedintruth">http://www.facebook.com/foundedintruth</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/foundedintruth">https://instagram.com/foundedintruth</a><br /><br />►►Our Vision◄◄<br />Founded In Truth exists to build a community that bears the image of God and lives the redeemed life Yeshua gives.<br /><br />⬤⬤⬤The Three Pillars of our Community⬤⬤⬤<br /><br />►►Yeshua◄◄<br />We are a community formed by the teachings, life, death, and resurrection of a rabbi from Nazareth named Yeshua (Jesus). It is through His spirit by which we find our common bond. Through the paradox of His death on the cross, we find the way to God’s love, the truth of all He is, and the life that only He can provide – one that is eternal. The gospel of Yeshua is the foundation for our community locally and beyond.<br /><br />►►Family◄◄<br />If there is one thing we celebrate at Founded in Truth, it is family. Whether your household is small or large, local or far away, you are invited to take your place here with us. We thrive together to build up an atmosphere that shows forth God’s love in a very real way not just to be a fellowship but also to teach the children in the community what being an image bearer is all about.<br /><br />►►Fellowship◄◄<br />We value each other. In the Beginning, God said it was not good for man to be alone. We were meant for fellowship, and we believe when we come together, we celebrate God’s goodness, promises, and grace. We know God has called our lives to intersect, so what better way to fulfill the command of scripture to love one another?<br /><br />Founded in Truth Fellowship<br />1689 Springsteen rd<br />Rock Hill, SC 29730<br />www.foundedintruth.com{% endraw %}
