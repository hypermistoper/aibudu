{% raw %}Discover Beltane, sacred and historic pagan festival of fire, sex and life! The Green Man (Jack in the Green, Green Knight) and the May Queen (Spring Goddess, Queen of the Faeries) symbolise the fertility of peak spring and the beginning of summer! Beltane is 1 of 8 sabbats in the pagan Wheel of the Year, and in the Northern Hemisphere celebrations begin on the eve of May 1st (May Day). This event is one of the most unique of it's kind as it has maintained the ritualistic tradition of the holiday which will surely give you vibes taken straight from an episode of the History Channels 'Vikings'! (all hail Queen Lagertha!) See performers and members of the Edinburgh based Beltane Fire Society in fantastic, traditional costumes, representing the archetypes and deities of the season and follow the procession around as the story unfolds before your eyes! This event is held at Calton Hill in Edinburgh, Scotland. We recommend buying tickets in advance as this event tends to sell out! If you plan to drive in to the city you can save time and money by booking a parking space in advance! Just search in Google and you'll be surprised how easy it is to enjoy this sensational spectacle! <br /><br />Join our Stone Circle Sisterhood here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/189103482527678/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/189103482527678/</a>{% endraw %}
