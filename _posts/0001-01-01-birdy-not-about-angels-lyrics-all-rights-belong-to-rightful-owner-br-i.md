{% raw %}ALL RIGHTS BELONG TO RIGHTFUL OWNER<br />I love this song and I made a video with the lyrics of it.<br />Enjoy and thank you  for watching it, I hope you guys like it! :)<br />Here are the lyrics:<br />We know full well there's just time<br />So is it wrong to dance this line<br />If your heart was full of love<br />Could you give it up?<br /><br />'Coz what about, what about angels<br />They will come, they will go make us special<br />Don't give me up<br />Don't give me up<br /><br />How unfair, it's just our luck<br />Found something real that's out of touch<br />But if you'd searched the whole wide world<br />Would you dare to let it go?<br /><br />'Coz what about, what about angels<br />They will come, they will go make us special<br />Don't give me up<br />Don't give me up<br /><br />'Coz what about, what about angels<br />They will come, they will go make us special<br /><br />It's not about not about angels, angels{% endraw %}
