The PK machine gun is used in a lot of Russian armored vehicles, but in vehicular form it uses a solenoid trigger, and doesn't have a pistol grip or shoulder stock. The basic mechanism is identical to the standard PK/PKM though. So these mechanics are adding a grip and stock (and bipod) to the PKT receiver to adapt the guns to infantry use.<br /><br />Interestingly, this was done a bunch in the US for a while. PK and PKM parts kits were a lot harder to get than PKT parts kits for a while, and a fair number of people built semiauto guns out of PKT kits - including essentially the same sort of modification these Ukrainians are doing now.<br /><br />Original video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/dcYSdzUs3cQ">https://youtu.be/dcYSdzUs3cQ</a><br /><br />Contact:<br />Forgotten Weapons<br />6281 N.
