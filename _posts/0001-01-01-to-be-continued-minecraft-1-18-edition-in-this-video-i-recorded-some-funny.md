{% raw %}In this video i recorded some funny minecraft moments after a long time, hope u guys will enjoy this :D<br /><br />-Comment you video ideas, i may use them in next video :D<br /><br /><br />FAQ : Why do you not use &quot;To Be Continued&quot; music?<br />     A - The &quot;To be continued music&quot; is  copyrighted. So i cannot use it But i use &quot;We&quot;ll be right back&quot; music Which has the same concept :D<br /><br />Thank you for watching my video, hope u enjoyed it :)<br />~zeiro<br />#minecraft​ #meme​ #memes{% endraw %}
