All of my hand planes were stored on their own little shelves and the smaller block planes were on an angled ramp that really messed with peoples' &quot;OCD&quot; apparently. So I decided to build a small Compact Plane Till to house my entire plane collection. The design is pretty straightforward, featuring a slanted mounting board and a lower shelf, constructed with dadoes and rabbets reinforced with dowels. The planes are held in place with the help of strong cylindrical magnets and the entire till hangs on the wall via a French cleat.<br /><br />I provide FREE plans for you but keep in mind you'll want to size this thing to your own plane collection. To do this, lay out your planes on your workbench, roughly in the order you want them. Then cut some 1/2&quot; thick spacers from scrap and use those as dividers between each plane. To make sure your planes have a little wiggle room, put a single piece of masking tape on each side of the bodies. Once all this is done, press the whole arrangement with your hands from each side being sure none of the planes are skewing and there are no gaps between the parts. The total width of this arrangement is the total width of your plane till's panel.<br /><br />In the video you'll see that I used small cylindrical magnets that I happened to have on-hand at the time. I later ordered larger, more powerful magnets that work better and those are the ones I recommend: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=D8A">https://www.kjmagnetics.com/proddetail.asp?prod=D8A</a><br /><br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKp44bWWZIiOPShPN_ytShw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKp44bWWZIiOPShPN_ytShw/join</a><br /><br />Check out our new short-form videos on Facebook! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thewoodwhisperer">https://www.facebook.com/thewoodwhisperer</a><br /><br />For more information, free plans, and helpful links: <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=thewoodwhisperer">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=thewoodwhisperer</a><br /><br />Take a woodworking class online with The Wood Whisperer<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thewoodwhispererguild.com">http://thewoodwhispererguild.com</a><br /><br />SUPPORT US ON PATREON! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/woodwhisperer">http://patreon.com/woodwhisperer</a><br /><br />PRODUCTS RECOMMENDED BY MARC<br />US - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/thewoodwhisperer">https://www.amazon.com/shop/thewoodwhisperer</a> <br />Canada - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.ca/shop/thewoodwhisperer">https://www.amazon.ca/shop/thewoodwhisperer</a> <br />UK - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/shop/thewoodwhisperer">https://www.amazon.co.uk/shop/thewoodwhisperer</a><br /><br />CHECK OUT OUR BBQ CHANNEL<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/twwbbq">http://youtube.com/twwbbq</a><br /><br />WOOD WHISPERER en Espa√±ol<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN0YcxiYZrgxp2TVC6W1oWg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN0YcxiYZrgxp2TVC6W1oWg</a><br /><br />CHECK OUT OUR SHOP TOURS<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thewoodwhisperer.com/shop-tours/">http://www.thewoodwhisperer.com/shop-tours/</a><br /><br />GET INSPIRED BY OUR VIEWER PROJECT LIBRARY<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thewoodwhisperer.com/viewer-projects/">http://www.thewoodwhisperer.com/viewer-projects/</a><br /><br />DOWNLOAD OUR FREE APP<br />iOS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/177u4An">http://bit.ly/177u4An</a><br /><br />Follow me on:<br />TWITTER - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/woodwhisperer">http://twitter.com/woodwhisperer</a><br />FACEBOOK - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/thewoodwhisperer">http://facebook.com/thewoodwhisperer</a><br />INSTAGRAM - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/woodwhisperer/">https://www.instagram.com/woodwhisperer/</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pinterest.com/woodwhisperer/">http://www.pinterest.com/woodwhisperer/</a>{% endraw %}
