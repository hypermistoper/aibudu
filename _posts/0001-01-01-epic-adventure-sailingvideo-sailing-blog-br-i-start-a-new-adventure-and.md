She is hand made in steel, 2004,  with a round bilge (hull) and a modified coach roof. This makes her a ‘one off’ and in my opinion the most beautiful Van De Stadt 36 ever built.<br /><br />The camera gear:<br />Main camera is a Panasonic Hc- V700 with a Rode External mic with a sponge and dead kitten attached.<br />Action, underwater scenes and small blogging is done with two Osmo action cams. Some boat shots are done with a Dji gimbal camera. <br /><br />Editing:<br />Final cut pro on a Macbook. Most of the material for each video is filmed over a period of several weeks or so and the editing of each episode is normally done over a day. This process can take longer if original music is used or permissions are needed for copyrighted materials etc. Much time is spent sorting out technical problems. In this case I normally get the help of a younger person who understands computerie stuff!   <br />There are also times when filming, editing and uploading is not possible due to being at sea or in locations with no internet access.<br /><br />Content:<br />I have found that filming and releasing material over a period of time is better than doing ‘vlog’ style videos and trying to make episodes out of whats happened in a week, regardless if it’s good content or not. By filming over a period of time I can be more selective in what goes into each video. My aim is to avoid ‘bland and mundane’ and have at least one or two exciting and interesting events in every video. Every video has to be entertaining.<br /><br />Comments and being at sea:<br />I love reading your comments. Most weeks Im able to read everyone. I cant reply to everybody but I do read and enjoy them. Keep them coming! There are times that It might seem I'm not on the internet for certain periods, this is normally when Im at sea on passage. While Im out on the Ocean I have completely no communications with the outside World.<br /><br /><br />Disclaimers and copyrights :<br />All video content on this  channel/page is copyright and must not be used without permission.<br />All music used in this series is original or, free to use, royalty free, used with permission.
