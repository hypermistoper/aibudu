{% raw %}Khnapat village (Askeran region). Many times the residents have been subjected to shelling, shooting, and harassment from the Azerbaijani forces. In March of this year, the Azerbaijani army shelled the school while the children were in class. Residents are now scared to send their kids to school. Azerbaijani forces play very loud music and speak with loudspeakers, telling the residents to leave the village in 120 hours otherwise they'll be massacred. Most recently, Azerbaijan violated the ceasefire regime, occupied the neighboring village of Parukh, and is heading towards the height of Karalguh, which is not far from the village of Khnapat. The inhabitants are very worried because if Azerbaijan occupies this height, they will not have the opportunity to live freely and peacefully in their ancestral land. There are many refugees from Azerbaijani-occupied villages in the village. And everyone is trying to repair their broken lives.<br /><br />While everyone is distracted with the #Ukraine and #Russia war, #Azerbaijan is using this opportunity and attacking the Armenian population of Artsakh, aiming at finishing their plans of ethnically cleansing the Armenian population from their indigenous lands. On top of this, all of Artsakh has seen an unprecedented snowfall and has been deprived of heating and warm water for over 3 weeks because of a blown up natural gas pipeline near the occupied Shushi, courtesy of Azerbaijan. A real humanitarian crisis and a grim security situation in Artsakh, and the residents of this border community feel extremely anxious and abandoned by everyone.<br /><br />_______<br />&quot;The Desire To Live&quot; is a documentary film from Armenia and Artsakh.
