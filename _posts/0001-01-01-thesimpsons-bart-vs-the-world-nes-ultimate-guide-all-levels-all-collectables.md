The World the best Simpsons game for the NES?  After the massive success of the first game, Bart Vs. the Space Mutants, publisher Acclaim Entertainment knew they had to do a sequel.  The game may look similar at first glance, but this time the levels are much bigger, and have more vertical elements to them!<br /><br />   That's not the only improvement they had in store for the sequel. This time Bart will be traveling around the world, which adds some spice and variety to the gameplay.   Exploration is even more important this time, because not only are the levels larger, but they also contain hidden items that can unlock a secret bonus level, and the game's true ending!  This kind of thing is fairly common in modern times, but in the 1990's, it was super rare! <br /><br />    So how did this game get made?  In today's episode we'll find out, and then we'll dive deep into the gameplay where we'll learn:<br /><br />* How to beat EVERY LEVEL - China, The North Pole, Egypt, and Hollywood - they're all here!<br /><br />* Where to find ALL of the UNIQUE KRUSTY COLLECTABLES! <br /><br />* How to perform the most DIFFICULT JUMPS easily!<br /><br />* Where to get TONS of EXTRA LIVES!<br /><br />* How to unlock the SECRET BONUS LEVEL - Hollywood Soundstage 3!<br /><br />* The best strategies for defeating EVERY BOSS, even Eric Von Burns... AND MORE!<br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />&quot;Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
