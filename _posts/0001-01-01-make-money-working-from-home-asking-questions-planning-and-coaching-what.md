{% raw %}Today's video is about another work from home opportunity... life coaching. Life coaching requires minimum training, however, I do recommend getting certified and checking with your state on what it requires to operate as a life coach as this can change at anytime. <br /><br />The more certifications you have, the more clients can trust you are following the generally accepted life coaching practice which I describe in this video. <br /><br />I personally have multiple certifications in the below topics:<br />Master NLP (neuro linguistic Programming) coach<br />Law of attraction coach<br />stress management coach<br />business coach<br />career coaching<br />art therapy coaching <br /><br />Want to learn more about my coaching services?
