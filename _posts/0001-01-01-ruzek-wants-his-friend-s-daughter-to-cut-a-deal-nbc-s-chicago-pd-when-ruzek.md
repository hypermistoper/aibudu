Handpicked as the head of the unit, Det. Sgt. Hank Voight (Jason Beghe) has assembled a team of diverse detectives who share his passion and commitment to keeping the city safe. They include Jay Halstead (Jesse Lee Soffer), Officer Kim Burgess (Marina Squerciati), Officer Adam Ruzek (Patrick John Flueger), Officer Kevin Atwater (LaRoyce Hawkins) and Det. Hailey Upton (Tracy Spiridakos), the newest member of the team with killer instincts, humor and smarts. Desk Sgt. Trudy Platt (Amy Morton) runs a tight precinct with tough love, although she lets her softer side shine through from time to time.<br /><br />Chicago PD is available now on Peacock, the new streaming service from NBCUniversal. Watch thousands of hours of hit movies and shows, plus daily news, sports, and pop culture updates.
