{% raw %}In today's video we are doing a line boring repair and bushing upgrade for a Dipper Arm off a Forestry feller buncher excavator. The position where the feller buncher attachment goes is worn out and the bushings are broken in the bore. First we remove the broken bushing using a special welding method before line boring out the bores with our Sir Meccanica WS2 machine. We also need to cryo freeze and shrink fit the new bushings using liquid nitrogen. While we have the liquid nitrogen out we show a few cool things that it can do!<br /><br />In this video we are using:<br />- Sir Meccanica WS2 Portable line boring machine<br />- WIA 500i Weldmatic welder<br /><br />Join our channel:<br />We upload new videos every Friday at 5pm AEST!
