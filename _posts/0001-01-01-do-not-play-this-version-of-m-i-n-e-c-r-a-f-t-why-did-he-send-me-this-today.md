{% raw %}Why did he send me this? :( Today I played a version of Minecraft which my friend linked me to. Here's the lore, I looked it up after:<br /><br />It's supposed to be some &quot;deleted version&quot; of Minecraft with AI built into it that Mojang was working on, except I guess it became sentient, and manifests as an evil player now? If you look up 'Error 422', it's the error code for an 'unprocessable entity'...
