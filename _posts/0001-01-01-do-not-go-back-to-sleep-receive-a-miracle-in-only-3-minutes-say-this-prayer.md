{% raw %}Say this prayer. Receive a Miracle in 3 minutes.<br /><br />Use this prayer to pray with power. Praying is not just repeating words in a sentence but feeling and expressing them with your whole being. To pray with power is to collect within you all your faith and hope , and use them to express to God (or whatever you call the Divinity) your wishes and requests. <br /><br />The best prayer, the most powerful, is the one you do with humility and dedication. Humility does not mean that you should humiliate yourself and say bad things about yourself. On the contrary, humility is presenting yourself before God accepting his will, without preconceptions and even if it is not the same as yours. You shouldn't tell God how bad you are and then ask him for a favor. To begin your prayer this way is to cut off communication between your soul and Spirit by creating mental distractions, guilt, and contradictions.<br /><br />Accepting the will of God and speaking to him with humility is even accepting that God has better and grander plans for you than you can imagine with your human mind. Be humble at the time of your prayer, asking God to do his will and not yours. Then express the desires of your heart.  <br /><br />Surrender to God all your concerns and all your doubts. And also give him your faith that, by putting your life in his hands, you will be able to clearly see his will and the path he tells you to follow. In order to see that path, that possibility, try to spend enough time in meditation and silence. Listen to your heart, the center of God's mercy in your being. Allow your mind to accept what your heart dictates and create a plan that goes according to this divine message. <br /><br />To pray with power you can use any prayer while holding in your mind and in your whole being your request to God.<br /><br />The following prayer can help you establish in your rational mind the space from which to express your request with faith and confidence that God hears you. Watch this video until the end to receive your blessing.<br /><br />----<br />Darius Wallis<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://prayershelp.com/">http://prayershelp.com/</a>{% endraw %}
