{% raw %}There are some questions I hear a lot, and some comments made on a regular basis.  Here are the answers to some of the most frequently asked questions and comments I get. <br /><br />A behind the scenes look at what a former worker at Disney World, Silver Dollar City, and Busch Gardens Florida experienced in his time working at the parks.  From driving large safari trucks around live wild animals while cracking one silly joke after another, to spending 5 years as a #PhotoPass photographer at #WaltDisneyWorld and seeing and experiencing all sorts of things, to being a conductor and #trainrobber on the famous Frisco Silver Dollar Line at #SilverDollarCity.  With 10 years of working in the parks, there's lots of stories to tell.  Here is some of them...<br /><br />Not only did I work in theme parks for 10 years, I've visited a whole lot of them as well. Here's some stories of great visits, not so great visits, favorites, reviews, and much more. <br /><br />If you would like to support me, you can do so on Patreon, Paypal, or YouTube memberships<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/SirWillow">https://www.paypal.me/SirWillow</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/sirwillow">https://www.patreon.com/sirwillow</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkEco5nJV_RWAbFS6Qho6Fw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkEco5nJV_RWAbFS6Qho6Fw/join</a><br /><br />Fan info:<br />Website: www.sirwillow.com<br />Facebook Fan Group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/196612161053366/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/196612161053366/</a><br />My Facebook page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheSirWillow/">https://www.facebook.com/TheSirWillow/</a> <br />Subreddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SirWillow/">https://www.reddit.com/r/SirWillow/</a> <br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/nhUSA7k">https://discord.gg/nhUSA7k</a><br />IdeaBoard <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ideaboardz.com/for/Sir%20Willow&amp;%2339;s%20Video%20Suggestions/3686527">https://ideaboardz.com/for/Sir%20Willow&amp;%2339;s%20Video%20Suggestions/3686527</a><br />Where I've been so far (ScribbleMap) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.scribblemaps.com/maps/view/SirWillows_Travels/Mfej11qupJ">http://www.scribblemaps.com/maps/view/SirWillows_Travels/Mfej11qupJ</a><br /><br />T-shirts, hats, and more available in my merch store!!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.spreadshirt.com/SirWillow">https://shop.spreadshirt.com/SirWillow</a><br /><br />Send me stuff!
