{% raw %}I'm just a little sick of people feeling like they've failed or like they don't matter because they aren't hitting every single target society puts in front of them. No one does that. And a lot of those goals are dumb anyway. <br /><br />I know that society thrives on driven people, and I hope you are driven to achieve, and that a lot of that drive comes from not necessarily healthy desires. But I think we can make the world a better place without putting all of this fucked up pressure on ourselves.<br /><br />Also, this video is basically the same as this one Evelyn made, but Evelyn's is way more funny and articulate: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=575LByUKT00">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=575LByUKT00</a><br /><br /><br />----<br />Subscribe to our newsletter! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/">http://nerdfighteria.com/newsletter/</a> <br />And join the community at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://nerdfighteria.com">http://nerdfighteria.com</a>  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://effyeahnerdfighters.com">http://effyeahnerdfighters.com</a><br />Help transcribe videos - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://nerdfighteria.info">http://nerdfighteria.info</a><br />John's twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/johngreen">http://twitter.com/johngreen</a><br />John's tumblr - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com">http://fishingboatproceeds.tumblr.com</a><br />Hank's twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/hankgreen">http://twitter.com/hankgreen</a><br />Hank's tumblr - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com">http://edwardspoonhands.tumblr.com</a>{% endraw %}
