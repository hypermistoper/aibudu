This animation takes you out to the Second Lagrange point (L2), beyond the Moon, the vantage point from where Webb will look out on the cosmos. Watch to get a better understanding of how Webb has access to the entire span of the sky from this location. Astronomers will point Webb at hundreds of targets across the sky, making it an important tool for investigating the big questions about our universe.<br /> <br />Credit: Produced by the Space Telescope Science Instituteâ€™s Office of Public Outreach; Narration: Lara Wilkinson; Writing: Alex Lockwood and Leah Ramsay; Designer: Leah Hustak; Music: Associated Production Music (www.apmmusic.com).<br />All images, illustrations, and videos courtesy of NASA, ESA, and STScI except: JWST 3D model courtesy of Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems.<br /><br />Many thanks to: Greg Bacon, Paul Geithner, Christine Godfrey, Joel Green, Bill Hathaway, Joseph Olmsted, Christine Pulliam, Eric Smith, Amber Straughn, Elizabeth Wheatley, James Wilson.{% endraw %}
