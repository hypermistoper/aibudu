{% raw %}Vanessa Bryant can always count on her friends to be there for her. The 39-year-old stepped out at the 2022 NBA All-Star Game on Sunday, where she received some love and support from one of her late husband Kobe Bryant's longtime friends. Vanessa was photographed hugging Michael Jordan at the event. Michael and Kobe were really close over the years leading up to Kobe's tragic passing in 2020.{% endraw %}
