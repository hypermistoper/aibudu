{% raw %}Post operative liver failure (PLF) has been a major barrier for patients requiring extensive liver  resections for high tumor load. The surgical objective is to obtain tumour free margins, yet maintain enough functional liver volume to prevent PLF. This has resulted in many patients being labeled as having unresectable disease. <br />   Recently a new procedure has been described known as an Associating Liver Partition with Portal Vein Ligation for Staged Hepatectomy (ALPPS). It is a 2 step procedure that stimulates an accelerated hypertrophy of the future liver remnant within a 1 week interval, helping to avoid PLF while removing the malignant disease.<br />   Our patient was a 61-year-old man with a history of hypertension, who presented with metachronous colorectal cancer. There was an interval of 1 year between removal of his primary tumour and the diagnosis of liver metastasis. CT scan demonstrated extensive tumour growth throughout the right liver with a very small, yet tumour free, left lateral segment. The patient had a partial response after systemic chemotherapy and thus we offered an ALPPS procedure.<br />   Intraoperative ultrasound demonstrated tumour free segments 2 and 3, prompting us to ligate the right portal vein before performing a partition of the liver between segment 4 and the left lateral segment. The deportalized right liver was left attached only by the hepatic veins, and the right hilar plate to the porta hepatis. The right hepatic artery helped maintain liver synthetic function over the 1-week interval. The left remnant nearly doubled in size from receiving 100% of the portal inflow at this time, and thus we completed the right extended hepatectomy. <br />   The patient recovered with no evidence of PLF and was discharged in stable condition 15 days after the first operation. Today we have successfully performed 8 ALPPS cases and this video reports one of our experiences with this innovative technique.{% endraw %}
