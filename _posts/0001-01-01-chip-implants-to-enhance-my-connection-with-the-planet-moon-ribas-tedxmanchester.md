{% raw %}If we could extend our senses in order to perceive the planet in a deeper way, would our understanding and our behaviour towards it be different? Moon will guide us on a mind-blowing cyborg journey to discover how technology can bring us closer to nature.<br /><br />Moon Ribas is a Catalan avant-garde artist and a cyborg. She is best known for developing the Seismic Sense, an online seismic sensor implanted in her feet that allows her to perceive earthquakes taking place anywhere in the planet through vibrations in real time.  Moon transposes the earthquakes into either sound or dance. Moonâ€™s seismic sense also allows her to feel moonquakes, the seismic activity on the Moon. She believes that by extending our senses to perceive outside the planet, we can all become senstronauts. Adding this new sense allows her to be physically on Earth while her feet feel the Moon.<br /><br /> <br /><br />Since 2007 Moon has been experimenting with the union between technology and her body to explore the boundaries of perception and to experience movement in a deeper way.  In 2010 she co-founded the Cyborg Foundation, an international organisation that aims to help people become cyborgs, defend cyborg rights and promote cyborg art.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
