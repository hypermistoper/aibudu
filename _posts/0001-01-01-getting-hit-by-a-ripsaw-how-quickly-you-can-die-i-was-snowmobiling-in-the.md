{% raw %}I was snowmobiling in the Utah mountains with Dave sparks and Cleetus McFarland and they took the ripsaw out for a cruise. So I hopped on a snowmobile to take some footage of it and didn’t think I’d be getting ran over by it in the next 30 seconds. This is why you always wear your helmet and appreciate what life you have.{% endraw %}
