{% raw %}In the season finale of Open Gym, the Toronto Raptors go to battle in the first round of the playoffs against the Philadelphia 76ers. A tough start sees the team battle injuries to primary players resulting in a 3-0 series deficit. But sparked by Scottie Barnes winning Rookie of the Year, and coming back from an injury that sidelined him in game 1, the Raptors get game 4 in Toronto before heading on the road for an impressive win in Philadelphia. However, their attempt at a never-before-seen comeback falls short in game 6. The team reflects on a season that exceeded expectations but also created a hunger for more.{% endraw %}
