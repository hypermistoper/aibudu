{% raw %}We have eyes that see for good reason. And videos like these are a very good reason to keep them peeled. It’s ‘eyes wide open’ when it comes to what you’re about to see. Promise! You’re going to be asking ‘Am I living in the future?’ or ‘Are we living in the past?’ Sometimes both! From robots to real-life invisibility. Fake clouds falling to a fleshy LEGO Mini figure... Just try to unsee this! 15 Things Humans Were Never Meant To See #2<br /><br />For Copyright Issues, Please Feel Free to E-mail me: <br />TSindustries32@hotmail.com{% endraw %}
