{% raw %}...AND THE MOMENT Y'ALL HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR....ARE YOU SATISFIED?! I had a blast playing Angelica so I hope ya'll enjoy this! Took forever to edit and film but in the end, it's worth it! If you read this, comment on the name of the first video you watched from me!  <br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I am currently taking criticism and am still working on improving my ASL skills. I am an ASL STUDENT so do NOT learn from my covers. I do not earn money from them and will NEVER profit from a culture that isn’t mine. The reason why I haven’t deleted them is because I wanted to document my journey to learning sign and can look back and see how much I’ve grown. Thank you :){% endraw %}
