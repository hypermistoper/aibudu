Grab your water bottle, grab your towel, get on your bike and let's kick some butt! - Kaleigh Cohen Fitness<br />________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />New to my indoor cycling workouts? START HERE! 👉  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBJ0TIYiwZzjLnd3RU_J2y-dm9a34Ggw3">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBJ0TIYiwZzjLnd3RU_J2y-dm9a34Ggw3</a><br /><br />If you are doing a Spin class on a stationary bike or exercise bike instead of a spin bike and prefer to stay in the saddle, DO THIS:<br />2nd position: increase your speed! Try anywhere between 5-15 RPMs.<br />3rd position: increase your resistance and try and keep the same cadence. <br />________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />⭐️Want more workouts to help you reach your goals?
