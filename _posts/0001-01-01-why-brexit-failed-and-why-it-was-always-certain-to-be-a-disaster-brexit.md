{% raw %}Brexit was always certain to fail. It was a stupid idea dishonestly foisted upon a largely gullible public who were seduced by simple slogans such as 'Take Back Control.' Before the referendum Britain was reasonably prosperous and harmonious. After 45 years of dealing with and being an integral part of the biggest and most powerful trading block just 22 miles away the British public voted to leave with the meaningless promise that we would no longer be ruled by 'faceless bureaucrats in Brussels' and that we could instead strike new deals with countries all over the world.<br />Within a year of officially leaving the EU it is clear that such new trade deals will be very hard to achieve. In the meantime, in what may well be the biggest act of self harm ever imposed by any nation on itself, we have erected barriers to trade with the EU which for many are insurmountable and for others a huge inconvenience and additional expense.<br />It is plain to see that Brexit is a massive failure but one that cannot be reversed. We are now faced with almost inevitable economic declaine and all that goes with it.{% endraw %}
