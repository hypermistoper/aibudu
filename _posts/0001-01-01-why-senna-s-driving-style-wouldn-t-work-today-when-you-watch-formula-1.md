{% raw %}When you watch Formula 1 now, if you‚Äôre eagle-eyed (or a driving coach) you will notice that all of the drivers use quite a similar driving style. Like, pretty much, EXACTLY the same.<br /><br />Thumbnail livery by Davide Chiappini - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/davidechiappini_dcgraphics">https://instagram.com/davidechiappini_dcgraphics</a><br />3D Model by <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://racesimstudio.com">https://racesimstudio.com</a><br /><br />They are VERY smooth coming off the brakes, then one sweep of the steering wheel into the corner, then out of the corner - and smooth on the throttle again. <br /><br />That‚Äôs it, all of them do it. From Lewis, through to Nikita (mostly).<br /><br />‚û§ Join our Driver61 Community Discord! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/YCqFxF27VS">https://discord.gg/YCqFxF27VS</a><br /><br />‚û§ Subscribe for more incredible motorsport: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/AbD2f9">https://goo.gl/AbD2f9</a><br /><br />‚û§Follow us on:<br />   ‚û§ Instagram- @official_driver61 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/D61Insta">https://bit.ly/D61Insta</a><br />   ‚û§TikTok - @official_driver61 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/D61TikTok">https://bit.ly/D61TikTok</a><br /><br />‚û§ iPad Drawing sponsored by Concepts, you can get an exclusive free trial here! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://concepts.app/driver61">https://concepts.app/driver61</a><br /><br />Now, I have broken down a lot of different drivers‚Äô driving styles on this channel. The Alonso video kinda kicked things off for Driver61. <br /><br />He would drive in a deliberately horrible style, inducing massive understeer - heating up the famously hard-wearing Michelins to then give him grip on exit. <br /><br />Then there‚Äôs Schumacher - he drove the car very hard into the corner and rotated it mid-corner. This meant that he was [actually slower] mid-corner - but he more than made up for it on the entry and with a brilliant exit. <br /><br />‚Äî-<br /><br />But, now if you look at Verstappen vs Hamilton - the way they drive the car is remarkably similar. Honestly, go watch some onboards! [After this obviously - I would LOVE to include them here, but we‚Äôre not allowed.]<br /><br />So what‚Äôs up with that? Have they just cracked the secret to driving? Or is it the cars that mean everyone drives so similarly now?<br /><br />‚Äî-<br /><br />Well, let's look back at Senna. Over his time in Formula 1 - he drove a lot of different cars. All of which needed driving differently, so he always needed to adapt to the car. <br /><br />And it‚Äôs quite a collection of cars.<br /><br /><br />üì∫ F1 Driver‚Äôs Technique Explained<br /><br />‚û§ Senna‚Äôs bizarre technique: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3lORK59">https://bit.ly/3lORK59</a><br /><br />‚û§ How Schumacher‚Äôs style won 7 championships: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3527cVz">https://bit.ly/3527cVz</a><br /><br />‚û§ Alonso‚Äôs strange steering: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Z7a93v">https://bit.ly/2Z7a93v</a><br /><br />‚û§ How Verstappen will be F1 champion: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3jK6L6n">https://bit.ly/3jK6L6n</a><br /><br />‚û§ How Verstappen is so fast in the wet: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/32WMVhr">https://bit.ly/32WMVhr</a><br /><br />üì∫ F1 Engineering<br /><br />‚û§ How F1 brakes work: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3h0Whh0">https://bit.ly/3h0Whh0</a><br /><br />‚û§ How an F1 clutch works: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3i0oDJM">https://bit.ly/3i0oDJM</a><br /><br />‚û§ What‚Äôs inside an F1 gearbox: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2DzMqRW">https://bit.ly/2DzMqRW</a><br /><br />‚û§ How F1 teams change four tyres in two seconds: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2QVpkIl">https://bit.ly/2QVpkIl</a><br /><br />üèéÔ∏è Track &amp; Racing Driver!<br /><br />‚û§ Get a free report on your track driving: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2LmYNBA">http://bit.ly/2LmYNBA</a><br /><br />‚û§ Get faster on track with our FREE 25-part tutorial series:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2PypIMK">http://bit.ly/2PypIMK</a><br /><br />‚û§ Our real-world training programmes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ktjtgV">http://bit.ly/2ktjtgV</a><br /><br />üèÅ Sim Racers!<br /><br />‚û§ My sim wheel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/354BBlY">https://bit.ly/354BBlY</a><br /><br />‚û§ My sim pedals: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3eJckQo">https://bit.ly/3eJckQo</a><br /><br />‚û§ Our sim racing course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/34WuV7p">https://bit.ly/34WuV7p</a><br /><br />‚û§ Get a free report on your track driving: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2LmYNBA">http://bit.ly/2LmYNBA</a><br /><br />‚û§ Driver61 Sim Racing Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2BMdk4B">http://bit.ly/2BMdk4B</a><br /><br />#Formula1 #Senna #Schumacher{% endraw %}
