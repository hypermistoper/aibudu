{% raw %}Today we take a deeper dive into my experience maintaining 4% body fat for the greater part of the past two years. Discussing some of the crazy things I did to keep this physique; training three times per day, striving to hit 20,000 steps per day, my irrational perception (body dysmorphia) of myself, and more.
