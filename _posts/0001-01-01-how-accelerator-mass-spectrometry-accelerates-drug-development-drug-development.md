{% raw %}Drug development is expensive, time consuming, and there is no guarantee for success. But drug discovery is vitally important. TNO can now accelerate the process with its brand-new Biomedical Accelerator Mass Spectrometer, and deliver a streamlined drug development program. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tno.to/937ee">https://tno.to/937ee</a><br /><br />We combine the knowledge of which fraction contains substantial amounts of the tagged atoms, with the metabolite information from the high-resolution mass spectrometer.  <br /><br />Using the AMS, human metabolism can be assessed before entering large-scale, preclinical and clinical studies. This way, TNOâ€™s Biomedical AMS helps to create a more efficient drug development process, so costs can be reduced and medicines become available faster. <br /><br />Learn more about how we enable tomorrow's medicine: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tno.to/e9069">https://tno.to/e9069</a><br /><br />#drugdevelopment<br /><br />Subscribe to our newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tno.to/newsletter">https://tno.to/newsletter</a> <br />Follow TNO on LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tno.to/linkedin">https://tno.to/linkedin</a><br />Follow TNO on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tno.to/en_twitter">https://tno.to/en_twitter</a><br />Follow TNO on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tno.to/facebook">https://tno.to/facebook</a>{% endraw %}
