Now, after making the rounds and gaining the support of some of the worlds top Djs, 'Ninety Five' is finaly making it to market.<br />This track is defined by the 1995 house sound we all know and love, bringing together hi-hats, heavy kicks and pumping bass. This is the sound a lot of us grew up on, and it's a nice homage to the sound that made a genre what it is today.<br />Early support from Luciano, Loco Dice, Jamie Jones, Maceo Plex, Timo Maas, Adam Beyer, DJ Sneak, Soul Clap, Davide Squillace, Silicon Soul, DJ T., Lee Curtiss, Tiefschwarz and more.<br /><br />www.physical-music.com{% endraw %}
