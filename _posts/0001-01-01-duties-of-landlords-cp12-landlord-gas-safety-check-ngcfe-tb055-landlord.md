{% raw %}#TB055 #landlord Landlord Gas Safety Check NGCFE <br />Questions have always been asked around the requirement to carry out a tightness test or service when completing a CP12 / LGSR (landlord gas safety record). Many engineers argue that tightness testing is a vital step in assuring that the property is safe for tenants to reside in.<br />This video was created with the sole purpose of dispelling any myths around the legal requirements of an engineer when completing an LGSR by referencing industry documents detailing the legal requirements placed on a landlord and what engineers must be aware of when working alongside landlords.<br />Technical Bulletin 55 is a document that outlines a landlord’s duties regarding gas. It provides definition between the different types of checks / maintenance that the landlord must ensure are carried out in order to comply with their duties.<br />More specifically, the document separates the duties into two identifiable tasks.<br />Safety inspection<br />The landlord must ensure that every appliance that the landlord owns, for use by the tenant within the premises, is inspected and tested for safety every 12 months. While the tenants' own appliances do not need to be included on an LGSR, any flue serving a tenant’s appliance should be inspected / tested to ensure that it is fit for purpose. This isn’t specifically covered under the GSIUR however it is covered under other regulations specifically relating to the building fabric.<br />Tenant's own appliances can be included on a LGSR if agreed with the landlord.<br />Servicing and tightness testing are not included in the scope of a CP12 / LGSR. The safety inspection should include full 26.9 checks on all relevant gas appliances for which the landlord is responsible.<br /> <br />Ongoing effective maintenance<br />As well as a safety inspection, the landlord has a responsibility to provide ongoing effective maintenance on the appliances and wider gas system/carcass. This would include maintenance of pipework and servicing of appliances in line with the manufacturer’s instructions. While many landlords may opt to have this maintenance carried out at the same time as the LGSR (as is advised by gas safe), the two duties are in fact separate from each other.<br /> <br />For any further advice or training on the requirements on engineers and landlords, please contact National Gas Centre for Excellence on 01924973260 or visit www.ngcfe.co.uk{% endraw %}
