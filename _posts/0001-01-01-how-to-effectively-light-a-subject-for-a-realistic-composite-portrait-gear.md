For minimal post-production editing and a better final image, photographers must do their best to match the lighting in studio to the lighting in their chosen composite background image.<br /><br />By utilizing two edge lights and a larger main light, portraits are easier to match with background composite image and this results in a more realistic final photograph.<br /><br />Subscribe to Westcott Lighting's YouTube channel to see exclusive behind-the-scenes content, lighting education, and the latest gear tips from your favorite professional photographers and filmmakers.{% endraw %}
