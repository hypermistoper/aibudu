{% raw %}At the age of 43, Tom retired from his 9-5 at Ford Motor through a combined effort of savings and stock market investments, although, on the day when he graduated college, he didn't have a penny to his name.<br /><br />Tom reached $1,000,000 and quit his 9-5 to live off his investments before his 44th birthday. More than half of that money came from returns in the stock market, and his investments helped him reach this number 14 years earlier than his salary alone would have done. With this type of money Tom was confident that his stock market returns could cover his yearly expenses. <br /><br />This is the story of Tom’s accomplishment. <br /><br />---<br /><br />Many thanks to my friend Richard Dykes, who helped me in making this video possible.<br /><br />---<br /><br />Timestamps for your road to your first $1,000,000:<br />00:00 Intro<br />02:15 $0 - $20,000<br />07:02 $20,000 - $100,000<br />13:30 $100,000 - $1,000,000<br />20:34 $1,000,000 &amp; beyond<br /><br />---<br /><br />My goal with this channel is to help you make more money and improve your personal finances. How to become a millionaire? There are many ways to get there – investing in the stock market, becoming a stock trader, doing real estate investing, or why not becoming an entrepreneur? But whether you are interested in how to invest in stocks or investing strategies for creating passive income with rental properties – I hope to be able to provide you with a solution (or at least an idea) here. Warren Buffett - the greatest investor of our time - says that you should fill your mind with competing ideas and then see what makes sense to you. This channel is about filling your mind with those ideas. And in the process – upgrading your money-making toolbox.{% endraw %}
