{% raw %}Single vs Double Port Compensator Comparison. Cole and DJ go over their preferences between single and double port. They cover performance, grip, cycling issues if you don't pick the right ammo or if you are milking the trigger and not allowing it to reset properly. We shoot hundreds of rounds every range day with zero malfunctions until we start to demonstrate bad examples of grip and trigger prep and reset. At the very end of the video notice the cycling issues we have with improper grip, no trigger prep and slapping the trigger- If you are gonna run Comp pistols- see what it takes to make them run and keep them running.<br />** Take note of how far the 115 ejects from the single port- then check out the same on 124 grain.<br />** if you want to have a comp on your primary pistol** spend the money on quality ammo to keep it cycling. 124 grain or above. We appreciate you all, keep training and drop us more questions and suggestions in the comment section.    <br /><br />comment. Like. Share.
