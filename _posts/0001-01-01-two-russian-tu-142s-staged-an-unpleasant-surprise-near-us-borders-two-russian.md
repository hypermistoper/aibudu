{% raw %}Two Russian Tu-142 planes gave the Americans their first surprise in 2021.<br />Tonight, two Russian long-range anti-submarine Tu-142 aircraft flew to the American borders, thereby arranging a rather unpleasant surprise for the US Air Force - the Russian aircraft were not noticed in advance, and therefore fifth generation fighters had to be raised to identify them and the probable interception of the US Air Force F-22, however, it is reported that Russian aircraft did not violate the boundaries of US airspace.<br />â€œAt approximately 19:00 pm ET, NORAD forces in Alaska identified and traced two Russian Tu-142 naval patrol aircraft entering the Alaska air defense identification zone. The aircraft remained in international airspace and did not enter the sovereign airspace of the United States and Canada. &quot;, - said in a statement.<br />The representatives of the defense department did not report the purpose of the flight of two Russian long-range anti-submarine Tu-142 aircraft, however, given the entry into the waters of the Black Sea of ??an American missile destroyer, such actions of the Russian Aerospace Forces may be a response to US provocations.{% endraw %}
