{% raw %}The history of scientific experiments conducted on the pyramids of Egypt is fraught with controversy. Fortunately, advancements in non-invasive technologies such as muography are allowing us to get a better understanding of the pyramids than ever before.<br /><br />In 2017, the ScanPyramids mission shocked the world with the announcement of the ‘Big Void’ within the Great Pyramid of Giza. This empty space is enormous, nearly equal in size to the Grand Gallery and sits above it in relatively vertical alignment.<br /><br />After this unprecedented discovery, the Exploring the Great Pyramid mission was launched to follow up on this discovery. Still in the planning stages, the EGP mission may allow a 3D visualization up to 100x greater detail than previous scans.<br /><br />However, entrenched interests within Egyptology do not have a great track record of sharing fame and recognition with outsiders. Can the EGP mission overcome the doubt and adversity that previous missions have faced?{% endraw %}
