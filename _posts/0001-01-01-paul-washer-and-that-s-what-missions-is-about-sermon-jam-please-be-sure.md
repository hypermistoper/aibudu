The incredible thing to realize about the love of God for this little jungle pastor is that if God loves him that much, He also loves you that much. If God will go out of His way to provide for this poor pastor walking by faith, then He will do the same for the rest of us as we also walk by faith in the callings He has given to us... And sometimes God will move people from an entirely different nation to be a part of what He is doing through you.{% endraw %}
