These kinds of constructions can develop either as an adoc growth over time, or as a planned and cohesively designed set of volumes. Each has its own opportunities and problems when it comes to efficiency and architectural integrity. This video explores both and uses Chicago’s Pedway and John Portman’s Hyatt Regency near O’Hare airport as examples. Stewart Hicks visits these examples, discusses the implications of bringing our urbanism indoors, and compares and contrasts the spatial qualities of each approach — the contingent and gritty urbanism of the Pedway, with the pristine perfection of the hotel lobby and conference center.  <br /><br />__Membership__<br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYAm24PkejQR2xMgJgn7xwg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYAm24PkejQR2xMgJgn7xwg/join</a><br /><br />__About the Channel__<br />Architecture with Stewart is a YouTube journey exploring architecture’s deep and enduring stories in all their bewildering glory.
