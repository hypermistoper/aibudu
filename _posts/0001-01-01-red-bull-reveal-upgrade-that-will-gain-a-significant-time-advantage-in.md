{% raw %}Many feel that Red Bull are the second best team behind Ferrari at the moment and the results seem to corroborate that. Red advisor Helmut Marko has revealed the team’s plans to bridge this gap on Servus TV<br /><br />Link to poll: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkx8Fucjk5PsfccshfR41RwMH831_ph3eNu">https://www.youtube.com/post/Ugkx8Fucjk5PsfccshfR41RwMH831_ph3eNu</a><br />0:00 - Red Bull Will Bring “Significant” Upgrade To Imola<br />1:17 - Fast Feed<br /><br />I'm your host Dillon Shelley and first up on Formula World:<br /><br />Red Bull Will Bring “Significant” Upgrade To Imola<br /><br />Marko began by listing the current hierarchy of the engine manufacturers in F1<br /><br />“Ferrari are ahead. Honda, or rather Red Bull Powertrains, is in second place. And Mercedes, unusually, only in third”<br /><br />“But there is the opportunity for them to work on that until September 1, so in this phase we have to get as many points as possible”<br /><br />He then spoke about Ferrari<br /><br />“I think we are in a good position, but we have an almost equal opponent in Ferrari. Leclerc is driving absolutely flawlessly this season, so it will be an exciting year”<br /><br />Marko pointed out the key advantages Ferrari has over them<br /><br />“The Ferrari is a car that is always fast, in all conditions [regardless of] temperature or tyres”<br /><br />“Ferrari are gaining in the area of electrical energy. We hope that Honda will follow suit”<br /><br />He concluded by revealing how they plan to gain lap time by the race in Imola in less than a month<br /><br />“Our car is definitely more difficult to tune, but we will lose some weight [before] Imola”<br /><br />“That should give us a significant time advantage, time gain in other words”<br /><br /><br />Fast Feed<br /><br />Alpine’s Fernando Alonso feels that he “still has a lot to offer” [DAZN]<br /><br />“I think you will see me around for at least two or three more years”<br /><br />Defending world champion Max Verstappen “always knew [they] had a competitive car” [F1 Nation Podcast]<br /><br />“It’s just a bit painful not to have those points [from the Bahrain GP]”<br /><br />“Now we are back on track, we just have some catching up to do”<br /><br />Haas team principal Guenther Steiner has confirmed that they’re “talking about at least $500,000 in damage, maybe a million [from Mick Schumacher’s crash in Jeddah] [Speedweek]<br /><br />Former F1 team principal Colin Kolles thinks that “if you throw a million on the fire, the money will burn up just as fast as in Formula 1 if you don’t know what you’re doing” referring to Aston Martin team owner Lawrence Stroll [Sport1]<br /><br />AlphaTauri’s Yuki Tsunoda thinks that “it’s such a shame that [they] are having these [reliability] problems two times in a row” [F1]<br /><br />“We cannot continue like this, we have to solve this issue as soon as possible”<br /><br />Red Bull team principal Christian Horner pointed out “that there was a cat-and-mouse game going on between the drivers, where they were braking to a point where they were accelerating into the corner” [Post Race Media Debrief]<br /><br />“For the next few years we need to look at where the DRS detection is because you absolutely want to avoid getting into that situation”<br /><br />Williams driver Alex Albon doesn’t “really regret the move [on Lance Stroll that has earned him a penalty for the next race]” [F1]<br /><br />“For me it was a racing incident”<br /><br /><br />Will Red Bull’s update be good enough to gain an advantage over Ferrari?{% endraw %}
