{% raw %}In this game of Civ 6, we’ll be playing a new mod to test a game mode HARDER than Deity Civilization VI. Two steps harder to be exact. Welcome, one and all, to Deity ++.<br /><br />I often use Rome to test mods, run guides, and generally show off Civ 6 – this time is no different!<br /><br />Deity ++ promises a game two steps harder than regular Deity, giving the AI more Science, Culture, Faith, Combat Strength, Cities, Starting Units and Tech / Civic boosts. If you thought the start of a Deity game was hard, just wait till you see this…!<br /><br />Mod can be found on discord, as well as at this link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/deity.25865/">https://forums.civfanatics.com/resources/deity.25865/</a><br /><br />All maps, mods and tech support on getting these games to work are available on my discord, so swing by!<br />Make sure you subscribe below so you don't miss more Deity Civilization VI fun!<br /><br />Subscribe - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCEBBOJXdQ3lwoCtYkCnIRQ?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCEBBOJXdQ3lwoCtYkCnIRQ?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />Discord - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/QHB3AM3">https://discord.gg/QHB3AM3</a><br />Patreon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/ursaryan">https://www.patreon.com/ursaryan</a><br />Ko-fi - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/ursaryan">https://ko-fi.com/ursaryan</a>{% endraw %}
