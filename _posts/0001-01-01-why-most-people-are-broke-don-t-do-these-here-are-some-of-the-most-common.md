{% raw %}Here are some of the most common reasons people are broke so you can avoid them.  The reasons why people are broke are: they don't plan for emergencies, they don't have financial goals, they don't know where their money is going, they prioritise spending over saving, they make impulse purchase, they confuse wants with needs and just want everything, they borrow for depreciating assets, they ignore the big three expenses, they have a victim mentality, they are not consistent and they are working for money their money isn't working for them. These will keep a person broke forever. <br /><br />Find me on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Family-Finance-103181858073913/">https://www.facebook.com/Family-Finance-103181858073913/</a><br />Find me on Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/familyfinance_/">https://www.instagram.com/familyfinance_/</a><br /><br />MY ETSY SHOP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/au/shop/FamilyFinance">https://www.etsy.com/au/shop/FamilyFinance</a><br /><br />AFFILIATE LINKS<br /><br />4 Months Free with SHARESIGHT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sharesight.com/familyfinance">https://www.sharesight.com/familyfinance</a> <br /><br />Shop Back: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://app.shopback.com/nkVqgskJ49">https://app.shopback.com/nkVqgskJ49</a><br />Cash Rewards: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://refer.cashrewards.com.au/x/VzrCNY">https://refer.cashrewards.com.au/x/VzrCNY</a><br /><br />BOOKS TO READ<br />Motivated Money: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2R1YJcz">https://amzn.to/2R1YJcz</a>  <br />DIE WITH WITH ZERO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3CfizpY">https://amzn.to/3CfizpY</a><br />The Simple Path to Wealth: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/327vpYz">https://amzn.to/327vpYz</a> <br />Your Money or Your Life:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3jZm3o3">https://amzn.to/3jZm3o3</a><br />The Index Card: Why Personal Finance Doesn't Have to Be Complicated:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3tzcsdl">https://amzn.to/3tzcsdl</a><br />I Will Teach You To be Rich: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35gvv2g">https://amzn.to/35gvv2g</a> <br />The Barefoot Investor: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/336AKP5">https://amzn.to/336AKP5</a> <br />Money Made Simple by Noel Whittaker: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/327Elxa">https://amzn.to/327Elxa</a> <br />Atomic Habits: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/32cCh7j">https://amzn.to/32cCh7j</a><br />The 5am Club: Own Your Morning, Elevate Your Life: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3h7PZwc">https://amzn.to/3h7PZwc</a> <br /><br />HOW I MAKE MY VIDEOS<br />I use Keynote to make my slides using images and text for from Canva:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.canva.com/join/rake-gardens-nails">https://www.canva.com/join/rake-gardens-nails</a><br />I then record my audio using my blue yeti microphone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZfJv8A">https://amzn.to/2ZfJv8A</a> <br />I then use iMovie to link my audio with the Keynote slides. <br /><br />Please note: some of these links are affiliate links where I'll earn a small commission if you make a purchase at no additional cost to you.<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />The information on this YouTube channel and the links provided are for entertainment and general information only and should not be taken as constituting professional advice.
