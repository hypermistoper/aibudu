{% raw %}The hallmark of a productive debate is not persuasion, but insight. So says Adam Grant in this wide-ranging conversation with John Donvan and Intelligence Squared CEO Clea Conner. A good argument is not only about convincing, Grant explains, but also to learn. In his new book, Think Again, Grant explores a set of cognitive skills that might matter more than pure aptitude: The ability to rethink and unlearn. That is the focus of this conversation; the capacity to change your mind, and why it matters more than ever. <br /><br /> <br /><br />#iq2us #debate #adamgrant<br /><br /> <br />===================================  <br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/IQ2onYouTube">http://bit.ly/IQ2onYouTube</a>  <br /><br />Official site: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.iq2us.org">https://www.iq2us.org</a> I <br /><br />IQ2US Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/IQ2Twitter">http://bit.ly/IQ2Twitter</a>  <br /><br />IQ2US Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/IQ2onFacebook">http://bit.ly/IQ2onFacebook</a>  <br /><br />==================================={% endraw %}
