Principal and Interest Payments on these bonds are required to be made in either Dollars or Euros. All of Russia's Overseas Assets are currently FROZEN so it will not be able to make the payments that are due in March. Putin has issued a DECREE that all future payments will be made in RUBLES. In this video I look at the Bond payments that are due, the details of the Decree, what happened when Russia DEFAULTED on its debt in 1998 and what the impact of this will be on RUSSIA and the GLOBAL ECONOMY. <br /><br />For specific details please check out the CHAPTER list below. <br /><br />Thanks for watching and please LIKE and SUBSCRIBE.<br /><br />If you like this video and are would like to buy me a coffee please click the link below.
