{% raw %}Today we test out a slug called the &quot;Twister&quot;.   It is a heavy lead slug that fragments into multiple,   large pieces on impact.   You may remember tests of Twisters with up to 6 petals,  and they worked well.   But there seemed to be a HUGE difference when the petals are large like these.   <br /><br />Check out OG's Danger Show:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/Tahow7798">https://www.youtube.com/user/Tahow7798</a><br /><br />A big THANK YOU to our Patreon supporters.<br />We are trying to get supporters to STOP donating because<br />fewer videos are getting demonetized and we are financially,  doing<br />better.{% endraw %}
