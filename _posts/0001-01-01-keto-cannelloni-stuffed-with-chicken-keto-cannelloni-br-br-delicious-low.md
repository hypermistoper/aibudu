{% raw %}Keto Cannelloni <br /><br />Delicious low-carb cannelloni made with leek and stuffed with chicken. Instead of making low-carb pasta, I decided to use leek as a pasta substitute. Stuffed leek shells with chicken and covered with amazing mushroom sauce. All the great things are simple! <br /><br />Ingredients <br />1 leek <br />2 skinless chicken thighs <br />4 garlic cloves <br />A handful of mushrooms <br />2 tbsp of sour cream <br />Salt, pepper and herbs to taste <br />Some butter and oil  for frying<br /><br /><br />Follow me on instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ketofriendlygirl/">https://www.instagram.com/ketofriendlygirl/</a>{% endraw %}
