In These stories Humans are often referred to as Human, Humanity, Deathworlder, Hellwolder in reference to the human planet of origin , Earth. This planet is seen by most of the universe as a place where only death and chaos can survive.<br />-------------<br />Taken from the FAQ of the r/HFY subreddit.<br /><br />Humans Are Space Orcs (HASO) or Humans Are (Fantasy Race) Are used as a guide when writing. <br />In these Stories we normally View humans like the other races view orcs in a Fantasy Novel. We (Humans) share the same characteristics and personalities as orcs. Humans are normally treated as the outsiders and barbarians. Humans tend to be underestimated as well in these stories. Unlike Humanity Feck Yea , these don't always put a positive spin on humans\humanity sometimes looking at the darker side of human and humanity from the perspective of aliens.<br /><br />---------------------------<br />Thank you to Tier 4 and 5 Patreons and Channel Members:<br />Revius<br />H-Town_F2<br />Brenton Verlo<br />john silva<br />LanScaper<br />William Howard<br />Sergeant Boomer<br />John Shafer<br />DoomSnek<br />Brian Means<br />Elim Tevir<br />Henry Hammerhead<br />Slackers United<br />B-Robbo<br />Robothaus<br />FallenAngeI<br />VulDwiin<br />James Kay<br />Ágoston Szabó<br />MrBishop077<br />Stuart Ford<br />angry t1t5<br />AzureKaizen<br />Ithilia<br />Ryan Barkenhagen<br />Ágoston Szabó<br />Blue Dragon<br />Trevor Smith<br />Cam Maxwell<br />Casper Arnholtz<br />Astraya Hauck<br />jordan Buxbaum<br />ANGRY MARINE<br />Albardin Guster<br />Savage Patch Pupper{% endraw %}
