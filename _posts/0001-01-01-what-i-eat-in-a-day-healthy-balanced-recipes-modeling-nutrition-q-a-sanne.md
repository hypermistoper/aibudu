{% raw %}What I Eat in a Day | Healthy &amp; Balanced Recipes, Model Diet Q&amp;A | Sanne Vloet<br /><br />Hi my lovely friends,<br /><br />Wauw I can't believe we are almost at the end of the year! I  hope everyone is getting ready for a cozy Christmas! I just landed in Amsterdam and even though there is a lockdown in The Netherlands, I am very excited to spend some time with my family. I havent seen them in so long so it will be nice to spend some time together. <br /><br />What are your plans for the Holidays? I got a couple of questions about food and staying on track during the holidays and I wanted to address it in this video and answer a couple of your questions. <br /><br />I just want to say enjoy the upcoming days enjoy all the delicious foods you are going to eat and enjoy family time! I will have a fun surprise for you in the New Year! I can't wait to surprise my family with the Matcha Chocolate because they havent tried it yet! Its going to blow their mind!<br /><br />Merry Christmas!<br /><br />Much love,<br /><br />Sanne<br /><br />Get your NEKOHAMA MATCHA CHOCOLATE for 20% OFF: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3GEMcno">https://bit.ly/3GEMcno</a><br /><br />Athletic Greens Powder:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://athleticgreens.com/en">https://athleticgreens.com/en</a><br />Avocado container: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3my4Dma">https://amzn.to/3my4Dma</a><br />Japanese Hotpot Recipe: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pickledplum.com/nabe-hot-pot-recipe/">https://pickledplum.com/nabe-hot-pot-recipe/</a><br /><br /><br />Follow me!<br />Instagram: @sannevloet (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2vlnHLy)">https://bit.ly/2vlnHLy)</a><br />Twitter: @sannevloet (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2OKggYH)">https://bit.ly/2OKggYH)</a><br />Subscribe!!! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2KzihS5">https://bit.ly/2KzihS5</a><br /><br />Follow the link to my gear page with everything I use to create content - B&amp;H Photo - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bhpho.to/34XSsaj">https://bhpho.to/34XSsaj</a><br /><br />Music: <br />I used music from Epidemic Sound -  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/GVgBV">http://share.epidemicsound.com/GVgBV</a><br />I used music from Music Bed - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.mscbd.fm/sannevloet">http://share.mscbd.fm/sannevloet</a>{% endraw %}
