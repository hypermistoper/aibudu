{% raw %}In today's gospel we have St Luke's account of what we know as the Sermon on the Mount.  In Luke's gospel it is the sermon on the way down from the mountain.  Jesus has spent the night in prayer upon a mountain.  He then chooses twelve of his disciples and calls them apostles.  In Luke's account Jesus addresses his words to the disciples only.{% endraw %}
