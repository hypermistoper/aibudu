This was a ride along event I did with Ready To Ride Rentals.  These group rides are open to whoever wants to sign up and come along.  This one was specifically marketed for riders of the intermediate level.  We took everyone through terrain that would challenge them and that would be enjoyable for everyone.  There were areas where the less experienced riders could have rest and the more experienced riders could try out a gnarly section. There were areas where everyone needed a bit of a hand getting through.  There were also sections that were perfect for a short teaching session where everyone could try something a little bit outside of their comfort zone if they wanted.  I absolutely love these group rides because everyone grows as riders and makes memories that will never be forgotten! I hope you guys enjoy the footage, and that you as always for supporting my channel!{% endraw %}
