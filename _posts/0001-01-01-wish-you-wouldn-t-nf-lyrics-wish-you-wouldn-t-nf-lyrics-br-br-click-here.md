Girl, why you angry?<br />Yeah, why you angry?<br />Back and forth, you love you hate me<br />Arguing about the same things<br />I don't, I don't know if I can do this<br />I don't, I don't know anymore, baby I don't know anymore<br />I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things<br />That you don't mean, that you don't mean<br />I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things<br />That you don't mean, that you don't mean<br />Yeah, I mean she wants somebody that's working a 9-5<br />I apologise but those ain't my hours, you ain't never been with a man<br />Who's working this kinda job, who works for this kind of drive<br />I wouldn't be with me either<br />Hold up, yeah I think that's work on the other line, I gotta go<br />We can argue some another time<br />Hand up the phone, I regret it right after<br />This is the chance that I couldn't just pass up<br />See I signed a deal, you say that I should've asked ya<br />I guess I was scared to see how you reacted<br />And maybe I knew I'd be selfish<br />These are the things I ain't proud of<br />I'm always the type to get jealous, there's always two sides to the story<br />And you're not the one that I blame when I tell it, that's real, yeah<br />You ain't the one, you ain't the one<br />I mean I should've manned up and that's hard to say as a man<br />The older I get the more I understand a relationship's more than just holding her hand<br />I'm sorry, you can blame me, yeah, you can blame me<br />I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things<br />That you don't mean, that you don't mean<br />I wish you didn't say things, I wish you didn't say things<br />That you don't mean, that you don't mean<br />What's going on?<br />I just wanna feel something, I just wanna feel something<br />There's too many things I'm tryna deal with<br />And I understand that you don't feel this<br />I said there's too many things I'm tryna deal with<br />And I understand I'm hurting your feelings<br />I know you don't feel this, yeah<br />I'm just expressing the way that I'm feeling<br />The things that I'm trying to deal with<br />I guess I've been trying to hold it all inside<br />But it's obvious that ain't working<br />Yeah it's obvious that ain't working<br />The only thing we got in common<br />Is that we got nothing in common, baby<br />Songwriters: Nate Feuerstein / Jarrod Ingram<br />Wish You Wouldn't lyrics Â© Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd., Capitol Christian Music Group{% endraw %}
