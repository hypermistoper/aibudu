{% raw %}From Diamond Tiaras to Betta Fish Brooches, the Best of This Year’s High Jewelry Collections.<br /><br />Indeed, the French capital was eager to welcome American clients and editors back for the annual July week of haute-couture and high-jewelry presentations, which was put on hold in 2020 due to the global pandemic. With everyone vaccinated, but still wearing masks out of an abundance of precaution, the hugs were warm and long, while the mix of handcraft and stunning stones from legendary jewelry houses, based in and around the Place Vendôme, did not disappoint. Several collections were edited, spokespeople were quick to note, partly due to an abbreviated timeframe to create one-of-a-kind jewels that typically require up to two years in workshops, though others noted that some pieces had already departed for Cannes, where they were hoping to be seen on some of the world’s most high-wattage celebrities during the 12-day film festival.<br /><br />That didn’t diminish, however, the abundance of sparkle on display over five days in Paris.<br /><br />Boucheron<br />Buccellati<br />Cartier<br />Chaumet<br />Chopard<br />De Beers<br />Messika<br />Piaget<br />Pomellato<br />Van Cleef &amp; Arpels<br />Graff<br />Gucci <br />Bvlgari <br />Mikimoto{% endraw %}
