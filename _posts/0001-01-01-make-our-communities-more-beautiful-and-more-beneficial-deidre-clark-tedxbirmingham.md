{% raw %}In this touching personal talk, nonprofit founder Deidre Clark shares the story of her brother's murder, and how she now works to provide a safe space so other urban youth don't face the same outcome. She challenges all of us to take ownership of making our communities more beautiful and more beneficial for those around us.<br /><br />Deidre Clark is a social entrepreneur, photographer, and the founder of Kuumba Community Arts. Founded in 2013, Kuumba Community Arts empowers youth to lead self-sufficient lives through art and design. Kuumba, which is Swahili for creativity, was birthed from Clarkâ€™s desire to provide young artists with a safe place to develop while gaining an introduction to the growing industry.<br /><br /><br /><br />The organization drives social change by establishing youth as paid professionals in a student-led design firm. Based in the Ensley community, students enrolled in the Teen Design Academy receive training from seasoned professionals in areas such as photography, graphic design, and screen-printing. Students have produced designs for clients such as Alabama Media Group, TEDxBirmingham, and WBHM. In 2015, Funding Emerging Art With Sustainable Tactics (FEAST) in conjunction with Birmingham Design Week recognized Kuumba for creating innovative learning opportunities.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
