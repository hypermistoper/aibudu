{% raw %}&quot;Obesity is defined as excess fat. Obesity is associated with a significant increase in mortality including reduced life expectancy of 5-10 years. Body Mass index (BMI) is the accepted standard measure of obesity /weight. Another measurement of obesity is waist circumference.<br /><br />Obesity has a complex pathophysiology involving genetics, behaviour habits. Energy intake and energy expenditure as well changes in neuroendocrine pathways. Increased energy intake - reduced expenditure.<br /><br />The causes of weight gain can be caused by life style behaviours, medications, endocrinopathies (cushing's) and many more.&quot;<br /><br />Had the pleasure of collaborating withe Blue Wednesday to make the outro for this video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqG4BLgo8VyK4LK8tXRqDVg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqG4BLgo8VyK4LK8tXRqDVg</a><br /><br />Support me:<br />🖼️ Buy PDFs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://armandoh.org/shop">http://armandoh.org/shop</a> <br />💵 Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/armando">http://www.patreon.com/armando</a><br />👕 Buy shirts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/ah-7">https://teespring.com/stores/ah-7</a><br /><br />Social media: <br />📷 Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/armandohasudungan">http://instagram.com/armandohasudungan</a><br />🐦 Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/armandohasudung">https://twitter.com/armandohasudung</a><br />📔 Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ArmandoHasudungan">https://www.facebook.com/ArmandoHasudungan</a><br /><br />Resources:<br />📕 Books: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://armandoh.org/resource">http://armandoh.org/resource</a><br />🎞️ Equipment: armandoh.org/armando-faigl<br /><br />You can send me mail:<br />📫 PO BOX 166, Randwick NSW 2031, Australia{% endraw %}
