{% raw %}Superconductors are used in MRIs and particle accelerators, but to maintain zero electrical resistance, they must stay at frigid temperatures. For decades, researchers have searched for a solution to this problem: superconductors that work at room-temperature. Many believe this discovery would open the door to a host of everyday applications. So far, the only reported room-temperature superconductor requires high pressure to function—but some researchers believe they can create ambient pressure superconductors by creating materials with the right chemical combination. Watch to learn how researchers think this superconductor might come to fruition, and why other scientists are skeptical.<br /><br />Read the story: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.science.org/content/article/thanks-bit-diamond-smashing-practical-room-temperature-superconductivity-could-be-close">https://www.science.org/content/article/thanks-bit-diamond-smashing-practical-room-temperature-superconductivity-could-be-close</a>{% endraw %}
