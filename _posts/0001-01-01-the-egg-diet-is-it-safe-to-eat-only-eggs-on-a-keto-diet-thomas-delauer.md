I'm going to give you an unbiased review, and I'm going to look at different things. I'm not just going to look at the cholesterol side of things, I want to look at omega profiles, I want to look at sulfur, I want to look at glutathione. I want to talk about the egg diet in a different light, and help you understand truly what it is. This is completely unbiased. I don't do the egg diet.<br /><br />Anyhow, if you don't follow me already, my name's Thomas DeLauer.

I'll give you my first off honest impression of the egg diet. It's something that's been sort of manufactured to piggy-back off of the keto diet. People are seeing that the keto diet is successful, and that it's getting popular, so people are starting to make different spinoffs with the same general underlying principles.<br /><br />Ultimately, the egg diet is more of a mono-diet. It's where you really focus on eggs as your primary source of fuel, if not your only source of fuel. Some people eating upwards of two dozen eggs per day, you can pretty darn aggressive. The whole idea here is that eggs supposedly have the abundant nutrient profile that you need to survive, and the perfect ratio of fats to protein. Some of that I'm not going to argue with, okay? If you have really truly good quality eggs, you can get a nice nutrient profile from them, and sure, the fat to protein ratio is quite nice, and supports a general ketogenic lifestyle, but there are some other things that we really have to look at.<br /><br />First off, it's never good to get your food from just one source. What's going to happen is your body's ultimately going to start to develop antibodies to it, and it's going to happen very fast. As we start to consume something over, and over, and over again, our bodies do start to create antibodies to it. It does start to create a reaction, basing specific IGE, and IGG responses within the body. These IGG responses make it so that your body signals an immune attack whenever you're eating this food in the future. This is the same kind of thing that happens with gluten intolerance.<br /><br />For example, back in the 1950s, we didn't have much of an issue with gluten, believe it or not. Nowadays, we have an issue with gluten. It's not so much that gluten has changed a whole lot, it's more so that we have over consumed wheat to the point where we're developing antibodies to it. Well this happens at a smaller scale, very aggressively, and very fast if you consume the same food, especially only that food. But let's talk about something different. <br /><br />I want to talk more so about the omega profile, omega-3s versus omega-6s. Eggs are generally about 1% omega-3, and over 14% omega-6. Now you might hear the word omega and automatically think that it's a good thing, but here's the thing, omega-6s are not good in high amounts, not good at all. In fact, very, very detrimental, so much so that there are multiple studies that link omega-6s with inflammation, and terrible conditions within the body.<br />What's the problem, why can't we just modulate that omega-6 with something else? Well, here's the thing, we need to be in equal balance of omega-3, and omega-6s. If we're consistently consuming a food that is higher in omega-6s, than the omega-3s, it's skewing that balance in our body. What exactly happens with omega-6s then? Omega-6s are what are called a pro-inflammatory fat. It is literally their job to signal inflammation at specific periods of time. Omega-6s help support the immune system. They literally are provoking inflammation.<br /><br />References: <br />1) Innes JK and Calder PC. (n.d.). Omega-6 fatty acids and inflammation. - PubMed - NCBI.
