Check out our videos: www.civicsacademy.co.za<br /><br />Democracies are characterised by the separation of functions and powers between the three branches of government: the legislature, the executive and the judiciary. Each branch checks the power of the other two so that there is a balance of power between them.<br /><br />The legislature is the representative of the people of South Africa. The legislative authority in the national sphere of government is vested in Parliament, which is the supreme legislative power in the country. Parliament is responsible for passing laws and for holding the executive branch of government accountable. <br />The power of Parliament is limited by the Constitution. The judiciary checks the exercise of power by the legislature. <br />Through its work, Parliament is tasked to make sure that the interests of the people of South Africa are represented in all their diversity.{% endraw %}
