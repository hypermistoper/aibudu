{% raw %}At least 50 people have been killed in a missile strike on a packed train station in the east of Ukraine.   5 children are among the dead and many more people were injured in the attack.<br /><br />The station in the city of Kramatorsk has been a major hub for civilians escaping from the Donbas region, which is now the focus of Vladimir Putin's war effort.  <br /><br />Many people were at the station when the missiles struck.  Ukraine has accused Russia of deliberately targeting the station and called it a “monstrous war crime”.   Russia denies responsibility and is blaming Ukraine for the attack. <br /><br />Clive Myrie in Lviv presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Jonathan Beale in Kramatorsk.<br /><br />Please subscribe HERE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1rbfUog">http://bit.ly/1rbfUog</a><br /><br />#BBCNews{% endraw %}
