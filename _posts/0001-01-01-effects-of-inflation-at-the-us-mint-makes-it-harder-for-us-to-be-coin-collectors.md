{% raw %}Welcome, in today's video we ask you to join us at JM Bullion to look at the live spot prices. Next, we went to Numismatic News Dot Net to read over an article written by Patrick A. Heller dated Jan 27, 2022, titled What is Inflation? Then, we went to the US Mint product schedule to look over the 2022 AWQ Silver Proof Sets and compare the price to a couple of years ago to demonstrate the effects inflation has had on the hobby. Finally, our plus one today comes from the TV show Undercover Boss. <br /><br />What is Inflation?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.numismaticnews.net/coin-market/what-is-inflation">https://www.numismaticnews.net/coin-market/what-is-inflation</a><br /><br />S11 E4 Jan 28, 2022, Rita's Ice<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cbs.com/shows/undercover_boss/">https://www.cbs.com/shows/undercover_boss/</a><br /><br />Support Son Of A Silver Stacker<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=FWLNZ95D38AX6">https://www.paypal.com/donate?hosted_button_id=FWLNZ95D38AX6</a><br /><br />Email Son Of Silver Stacker<br />sonofasilverstacker@gmail.com<br /><br />Join The Discussion On The Discord Server For the Son Of A Silver Stacker<br />discord.gg/Q8wVHfD<br /><br />Follow Son Of A Silver Stacker On Twitter<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/OfStacker">https://twitter.com/OfStacker</a><br /><br />This Channel is for Theory, News, Speculation, and Information About the World of Numismatics.
