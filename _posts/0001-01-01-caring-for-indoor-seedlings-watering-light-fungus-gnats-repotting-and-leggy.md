{% raw %}Two weeks ago I shared tips for sowing vegetable seeds in late winter for growing undercover. Many of those seeds have now germinated and I'm taking you through how I'm continuing to care for them. We'll look at grow lights vs no grow lights, how I water and deal with fungus gnats, when to repot seedlings into larger pots and what leggy seedlings are and what to do with them.
