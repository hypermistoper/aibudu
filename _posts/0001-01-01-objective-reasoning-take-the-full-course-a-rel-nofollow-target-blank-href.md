Where objective thinking means reasoning according to a set of logical and objective standards, while subjective thinking refers to reasoning without objective standards. Objective thinking means reasoning that is independent of the specific subjective context, not influenced by personal characteristics, feelings or opinions of the subject.{% endraw %}
