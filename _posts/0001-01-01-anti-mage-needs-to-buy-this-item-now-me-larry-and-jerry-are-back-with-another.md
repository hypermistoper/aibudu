{% raw %}Me LARRY and Jerry are back with another insanely broken BUILD in Dota 2! Just pick Anti-Mage, buy Diffusal Blade and you are going to win the game by destroying your enemies! Use this power with care, IceFrog is going to punish you if you are using this power for evil!<br /><br />If you have any suggestions on which combo or silly build we can try next, just make a comment about it, we are going to read every single one! Thanks for watching and see you soon my friend! :)<br /><br />Subscribe to see your weekly dose of DOTA üëæ:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC44wQ9n7GG0yt-WzZgBZLcw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC44wQ9n7GG0yt-WzZgBZLcw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />üëá Tell us in the comments below if you like our videos and we appreciate any feedback you can give us!<br /><br />üëç Like this Video &amp; Turn on Notifications üîî to gain more MMR üòÇ<br /><br />Music used in this Video:<br />00:01 - 0:13 Break Fast - Jules Gaia <br />00:13 - 00:25 Ubiquitous - Diamond Ortiz <br />00:25 - 04:02 Tiger Tracks - Lexica<br />04:02 - 07:11 Albatross - Lexica <br />07:11 - 09:50 Break Fast - Jules Gaia<br /><br />Follow us on Socials:<br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/hNQj2rMxNg">https://discord.gg/hNQj2rMxNg</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dotown.yt/">https://www.instagram.com/dotown.yt/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Dotown.yt/?ref=page_internal">https://www.facebook.com/Dotown.yt/?ref=page_internal</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Dotown2">https://twitter.com/Dotown2</a><br /><br />#dota2 #dota #dotown{% endraw %}
