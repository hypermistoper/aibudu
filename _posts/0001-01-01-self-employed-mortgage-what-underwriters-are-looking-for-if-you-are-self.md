{% raw %}If you are self employed and need a mortgage, it is important to know what underwriters are looking for. Getting a self employed mortgage has some challenges that most successful business owners don't think about until it's too late. The better the CPA is at finding legal deductions for you, the less income you actually have which lowers your buying power.
