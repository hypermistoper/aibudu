There’s a long and rocky version but we’ll give you the short one.  We have our fearless and unconventional mother, Young Salo, to thank. With a single-minded entrepreneurial spirit, she decided to start her own business at the age of 49.  She had a passion for the nail industry and we did everything in our power to support her. In the end, this is a family business.<br /><br />Greg, the older brother, became a licensed nail technician after switching gears from fire fighter’s training. He is energy personified and has a true passion for developing the best professional nail care products and education. Habib is the younger brother. He jumped in a few years later; taking a detour from medical school and a life in music. He brings his own creative mind for business, marketing and strategy. Unexpectedly, we are a perfect team.  <br /><br />Today, more than 20 years later, Young Nails Inc., is a professional nail care manufacturing company exporting to over 40 countries worldwide and distributing domestically to over 3000 stores. We’re  respected for our next-level product innovation and education. Our mission is to bring you the best quality products and we’ll show you how to use them with incredible results. It’s really that simple.<br /><br />Welcome to the Young Nails family!{% endraw %}
