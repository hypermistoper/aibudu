{% raw %}In this video I build a simple, DIY glove box out of easily-sourced parts from the local hardware store. This project is based on a video by Make Magazine: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDUNB3w1aU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGDUNB3w1aU</a><br /><br />Cost: ~$40<br />Time: ~1 hour<br /><br />The argon cylinder I bought from my local AirGas branch - they have a 'showroom' you can just walk in and walk out with a tank of gas!{% endraw %}
