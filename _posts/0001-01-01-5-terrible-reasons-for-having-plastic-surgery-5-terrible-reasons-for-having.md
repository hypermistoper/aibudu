{% raw %}5 Terrible Reasons For Having Plastic Surgery<br /><br />This video has been coming for a long time. These are 5 terrible reasons for getting plastic surgery. I see so many people make a lot of these mistakes and it often leads to regret and feeling worse than before. <br /><br />Khadija Mbowe's Video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNUWxlVJTs4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iNUWxlVJTs4</a><br /><br /><br />The reasons will range from trends, to moments of high emotion, to wanting something you shouldnâ€™t, wanting something that cannot happen, and others wanting something for you. That is about as much as I will hint about the reasons and so you should watch the video. <br /><br /><br />Some celebrities that will be mentioned in the video are mentioned only to express an example or to help visualize one of the reasons, I am not explicitly saying that every celebrity made the mistake that they are used to help explain, but some may have. Celebrities mentioned in this video are, but not limited to: Bella Hadid, Kelly Osbourne, Megan Fox, Darcey and Stacey Silva, Kim Kardashian, Ariana Grande, Tori Spelling, Jennifer Aniston.<br /><br /><br />I want every one of my viewers to feel beautiful, confident, and good about themselves and their body. Everyone is different and needs different things. Plastic surgery is something that everyone should consider for themselves individually on their own time and after a lot of research to make sure you find the right doctor for you, and the right procedure that will enhance the look you are going for. <br /><br /><br />Not discussed in this video is also the cost of surgery. It is not something to be taken lightly as it is permanent and can be expensive. Even if someone goes with just dermal fillers, botox, coolsculpting, skin lasers, and other non-surgical augmentations, it can still cost thousands and leave a lasting effect for years. Some surgeries are irreversible and trying to fix them can lead to them looking worse than before, so be careful when getting any surgery that will change the way your face looks, such as a rhinoplasty, blepharoplasty, facelift and more. <br /><br /><br />Please know that although I have a very informed opinion based on my own experience I am not an EXPERT or a Doctor.  Please visit a plastic surgeon for medical advice.<br /><br /><br />Special Thanks to Miss J from Miss J's forum; much of my knowledge was garnered from her.<br /><br /><br />LOVE YOU ALL!!!
