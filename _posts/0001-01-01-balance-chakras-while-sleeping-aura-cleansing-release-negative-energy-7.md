Read these steps, make sure youâ€™re somewhere where you can relax into this process, set a timer, and give it a shot:<br /><br />1) Take a seat<br />Find place to sit that feels calm and quiet to you.<br /><br />2) Set a time limit<br />If youâ€™re just beginning, it can help to choose a short time, such as five or 10 minutes.<br /><br />3) Notice your body<br />You can sit in a chair with your feet on the floor, you can sit loosely cross-legged, you can kneelâ€”all are fine. Just make sure you are stable and in a position you can stay in for a while.<br /><br />4) Feel your breath<br />Follow the sensation of your breath as it goes in and as it goes out.<br /><br />5) Notice when your mind has wandered<br />Inevitably, your attention will leave the breath and wander to other places. When you get around to noticing that your mind has wanderedâ€”in a few seconds, a minute, five minutesâ€”simply return your attention to the breath.<br /><br />6) Be kind to your wandering mind<br />Donâ€™t judge yourself or obsess over the content of the thoughts you find yourself lost in. Just come back.<br /><br />7) Close with kindness<br />When youâ€™re ready, gently lift your gaze (if your eyes are closed, open them). Take a moment and notice any sounds in the environment. Notice how your body feels right now. Notice your thoughts and emotions.<br /><br />Thatâ€™s it! Thatâ€™s the practice. You focus your attention, your mind wanders, you bring it back, and you try to do it as kindly as possible (as many times as you need to).<br />__________________________________<br />Â© ANGEL HEALING MUSIC Copyright 2021 All rights reserved.<br /><br />This work is not intended to substitute for professional medical or counselling advice.
