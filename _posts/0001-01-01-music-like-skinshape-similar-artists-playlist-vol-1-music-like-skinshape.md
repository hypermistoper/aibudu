The music is inspired by many genres, but in particular 1960s-70s Funk, Soul, Reggae, Psych, African music, Library music and Folk.<br /><br />Skinshape grew out of a love for old music and the way it sounded, from the songwriting through to the studio production. Initially Dorey experimented with samples (especially drum breaks) to create instrumental hip-hop/trip-hop tracks, but then later started to play around with tape machines and old valve studio equipment as a means to create his own 'samples'. This process gave birth to Skinshape, with all elements being recorded by Dorey (a.k.a. 'sample-free') since the first self-titled album, released in 2014.<br /><br />Aside from the Skinshape project, Dorey was bassist for the band Palace from 2014-2017, has toured briefly as guitarist for the band Monophonics, and also runs a reggae label called Horus Records that reissues rare releases from 1960s-1980s Jamaica and records original material at the same studio used for Skinshape in London (see Lo-Fi Showcase Part 3).<br /><br />Music like Skinshape | Similar Artists Playlist<br />#skinshape #similarartists #indie<br /><br />Similar Artists Playlists<br />Indie / Bedroom Pop / lofi / Dreampop / Electronic / Surf Rock<br /><br />Enjoy the uploads?
