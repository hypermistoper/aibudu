{% raw %}SATSANG OF THE WEEK<br />mooji.tv/satsang-of-the-week<br /><br />This very potent and deep Satsang is triggered by a questioner who raises the doubt that she still feels like a person experiencing a sense of vastness, rather than the vastness itself. Moojibaba's guidance invites us into the depths of self-realisation.<br /><br />&quot;You are not a person experiencing emptiness, you are the emptiness in which the dream of the person appears. All the while, the immensity of the Self is here.<br /><br />This awakening is open for everybody.&quot;<br /><br />7 October 2019 | Morning Satsang<br />Zmar Silent Retreat<br />mooji.tv/online-retreat/october2019<br /><br />Music after Satsang: &quot;I Hear You Call&quot; by Sangita, performed by Sangita and Prem Sweeney and Igor Malewicz.
