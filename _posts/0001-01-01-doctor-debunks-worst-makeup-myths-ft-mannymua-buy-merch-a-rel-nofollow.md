{% raw %}BUY MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://doctormikeshop.com">http://doctormikeshop.com</a><br /><br />COME SEE ME ON TOUR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.doctormikelive.com">http://www.doctormikelive.com</a><br /><br />Manny MUA is a YouTuber, make up artist, and my long lost brother? Well that’s what twitter things anyway. Today I invited Manny to the studio to see if his vast make up knowledge dipped into the world of medicine, and I’m proud to say he knows his stuff. I asked him several controversial questions about make up as it relates to your health. Today we talk about sleeping with your make up on, toxic lipstick, toxic nail polish, children/teen make up use, healthier vs. unhealthier make ups, SPF in your make up, anti-aging wrinkle cremes, washing your brushes, restoring your expired mascara, expired make up, using your fingers instead of a brush, and moisturizer on oily skin. Let me know down below if you have any more make up questions we can answer!<br />Donate to the Los Angeles LGBT Center here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://donate.lalgbtcenter.org/secure/help-build-world-where-lgbt-people-thrive">https://donate.lalgbtcenter.org/secure/help-build-world-where-lgbt-people-thrive</a><br /><br />Follow Manny here:<br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbO9bltbkYwa56nZFQx6XJg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbO9bltbkYwa56nZFQx6XJg</a><br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mannymua733/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/mannymua733/?hl=en</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mannymua733?lang=en">https://www.tiktok.com/@mannymua733?lang=en</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MannyMua733">https://twitter.com/MannyMua733</a><br />Snap: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.snapchat.com/add/Mannymua">https://www.snapchat.com/add/Mannymua</a><br /><br />I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously.
