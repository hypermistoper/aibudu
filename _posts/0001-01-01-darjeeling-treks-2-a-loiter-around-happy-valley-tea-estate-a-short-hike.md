{% raw %}A short hike down to Happy Valley made me realise how fortunate I am to be a resident in these beautiful hills. <br />Though the name Titanic Viewpoint brought a smile to our faces, it was aptly named. The view from that high curve on the road does draw your breath away. Go once. I'm sure you'll keep returning just to be absorbed by the peace that permeates these slopes of silent tea bushes... <br />#darjeeling <br />#naturelovers <br />#travel <br />#trekking <br />#teagardens <br />#shorthike<br />#hiking <br />#hikingadventures <br />#friendship <br />#friends <br />#humor<br />#happyvalleyteaestate<br />#happyvalley<br />#darjeelinghikes<br />#darjeelingtreks<br />#sudinkhaling<br />#sudin{% endraw %}
