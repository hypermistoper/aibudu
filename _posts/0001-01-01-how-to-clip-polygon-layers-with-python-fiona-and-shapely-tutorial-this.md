{% raw %}This tutorial shows the entire procedure to clip a polygon layer to an area of interest in Python with the use of spatial libraries as Fiona and Shapely. The tutorial opens the polygon and clip layer as fiona elements, interpret the geometries as shapely Polygon datatypes, clip the polygons and store results as an output shapefile with the corresponding metadata.<br /><br />Input data<br />You can download the input data from this link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hatarilabs.com/ih-en/how-to-clip-polygon-layers-with-python-fiona-and-shapely-tutorial">https://www.hatarilabs.com/ih-en/how-to-clip-polygon-layers-with-python-fiona-and-shapely-tutorial</a>{% endraw %}
