While it’s easy to blame climate change, we need to dive deeper. There has been a recent increase in polar vortex events, extreme heat waves like in the Pacific Northwest, and extreme rain like we saw after Hurricane Ida. Even fires in Siberia and drought hint at a new dust bowl. NOAA’s 2020 Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disaster report showed a notable uptick in extremes. And 2021 was no exception, with 10.6% of all weather stations reporting record temperatures. And with the continued emission of carbon into the atmosphere, this should come as no real surprise. <br /><br />But some new scientific research shows that there is a surprising thread that connects nearly all of these weather events. Tune in to learn why it feels like our weather is spiraling out of control and what we might have in store.<br /><br />Weathered is a show hosted by weather expert Maiya May and produced by Balance Media that helps explain the most common natural disasters, what causes them, how they’re changing, and what we can do to prepare.<br /><br />Subscribe to PBS Terra so you never miss an episode! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3mOfd77">https://bit.ly/3mOfd77</a><br /><br />And keep up with Weathered and PBS Terra on:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PBSDigitalSt...">https://www.facebook.com/PBSDigitalSt...</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/pbsds">https://twitter.com/pbsds</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/pbsds">https://www.instagram.com/pbsds</a><br /><br />Thank you Margaret A.
