{% raw %}This was my first Spring Training game in Florida in 28 years (!!) and it was AMAZING to be back for some Grapefruit League action.<br /><br />The Pittsburg Pirates faced the Baltimore Orioles at LECOM Park, and I got things started by catching a bunch of baseballs during batting practice. And after that? Well, you can see how much different stuff I got into over the course of the day. From playing catch with a Pirates player to my conversations with the Orioles coaching staff to seeing a car windshield get smashed by a foul ball, there was truly not a dull moment at the stadium. I probably could've picked something better to eat, though. Womp-womp.<br /><br />Wanna watch the new documentary about me? (Yes, of course you do because you're smart and because it's 95 minutes long and incredible.) It's called &quot;Zack Hample vs. The World&quot; and you can stream it on Prime Video, Apple TV, Google Play, YouTube Movies, Vudu, Vimeo on Demand, and the Microsoft Xbox store. Here's the trailer:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAoKYELB8VY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAoKYELB8VY</a><br /><br />To make it a little easier for you, here's a direct pre-order link on Apple TV: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/zack-hample-vs-the-world/umc.cmc.ab18bkwegsic2g25e243o3o1">https://tv.apple.com/us/movie/zack-hample-vs-the-world/umc.cmc.ab18bkwegsic2g25e243o3o1</a><br /><br />There's actually a contest that's open to anyone who pre-orders the film before release day (March 29, 2022) and DM's proof of purchase to @zackhamplemovie on Instagram. Look for details -- you can win lots of cool stuff. While you're at it, say hi to my intern Max (@max_edelman) who runs that account. Oh, and if you're in Europe or anywhere other than North America, Vimeo on Demand is your best bet: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/zackhamplevstheworld">https://vimeo.com/ondemand/zackhamplevstheworld</a> <br /><br />Want to learn how to use the &quot;glove trick&quot; that I showed? Here's an entire video about it: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wohQQ8Pkn28">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wohQQ8Pkn28</a><br /><br />Do you like the t-shirt that I wore in this video? Pick one up for yourself:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.zackhample.com/merch">https://www.zackhample.com/merch</a> <br /><br />As promised, here's how to find the company called Buckler that made my custom baseball glove: <br /><br />website: bucklersports.com<br />Instagram: @bucklersports<br /><br />They've been very nice to me. They sent me this glove for free (which I really do love) but never asked for anything in return, so show them some love!<br /><br />This video was filmed on March 22, 2022 by &quot;Fenway Chris&quot; (@yonnernyc), and it was edited by Rachel Messbauer. Huge thanks to both of them and thanks to YOU for watching. <br /><br />Finally, FYI, there will be LOTS more videos coming this year (including a bunch more from Spring Training) so just a little friendly advice: SUBSCRIBE!{% endraw %}
