{% raw %}The fully configurable process zone of COMPEO compounders opens up completely new process engineering possibilities through the application of mixing and kneading elements with two to six rows of screw flights. The new geometries make it possible to achieve previously conflicting goals such as a high specific throughput with controllable energy input. In addition, the process window is significantly larger with COMPEO compounding machine. Throughput can be varied in a ratio of 1:6, increasing both system flexibility and user-friendliness. <br /><br />The new state-of-the-art COMPEO compounder is perfect for cable compounds, PVC pelletizing, masterbatch, calender feeding, rubber compounds, performance compounds, engineering plastics, thermoplastic elastomers, thermosets, PBT, PET, bitumen, bioplastics, hot melt, friction coatings … <br /><br />Learn more about the COMPEO compound technology for polymer compounding in this video or visit our website.{% endraw %}
