{% raw %}Vale of Grace<br /><br />The second day on the trails of Greyton wastes no time in introducing the teams to the region’s spectacular trails. A district road start provides a quick warm-up before the dual tracks into the mountains above Genadendal spread the field for the trails to come. The mission station’s singletracks are raw and rugged, requiring absolute focus at all times. Luislang, before Greyton, and Mad Dog, after, are free flowing. Bakenskop, meanwhile, is not. A mountain biker’s mountain bike trail, worthy of entering Absa Cape Epic folklore, Bakenskop is a 9-kilometre-long ascent, ridgeline traverse and descent; all on shale singletrack. After the thrills of Bakenskop, the trail heads uphill once more, ascending the UFO climb before a last singletrack descent returns the teams to the Riviersonderend Valley floor and the grind back to the Elandskloof race village for the final time. <br /><br />🔔 Subscribe to our YouTube channel: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CapeepicMTB/">https://www.youtube.com/c/CapeepicMTB/</a> <br />🌐 Visit our website to access more content: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cape-epic.com/">https://www.cape-epic.com/</a> <br />📲 And Follow us on all our social networks:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/capeepic/">https://www.instagram.com/capeepic/</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/capeepic">https://www.facebook.com/capeepic</a>   <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/capeepic">https://twitter.com/capeepic</a>{% endraw %}
