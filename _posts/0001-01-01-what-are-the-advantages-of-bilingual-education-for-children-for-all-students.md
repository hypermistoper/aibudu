{% raw %}For all students, bilingual learning can mean higher cognitive function, better grades, increased language proficiency, and higher graduation rates and college enrollment. Acquiring a language is an active skill, and students benefit from active classroom participation.<br /><br />According to scientific studies, bilingual children are better able to focus, plan, prioritize and make decisions. As children get older they tend to score higher on cognitive tests and possess more effective communication skills. Many studies have also found that bilingualism can also help prevent dementia in old age.<br /><br /><br />Bilingual education develops important cognitive skills such as problem solving, logic, critical thinking and creativity because it exercises your brain and forces you to think about how you can express and effectively convey your thoughts with the vocabulary you possess in each language.{% endraw %}
