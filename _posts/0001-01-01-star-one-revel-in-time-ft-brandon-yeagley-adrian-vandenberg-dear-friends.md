{% raw %}Dear friends, you better hold on tight for this absolutely zany clip... here is the 4th single: ‘Revel In Time’! It’s based on the equally zany movie ‘Bill and Ted’s Excellent Adventure’. It was filmed in Holland and the U.S. and of course... in outer space. <br /><br />This is definitely is the most varied Star One album so far. After the epic ‘Lost Children of the Universe’, the fast and furious ‘Fate of Man’, the complex and proggy ‘Prescient’ we now have this deliriously wild ride for you with ‘Revel In Time’. I sure hope you have a sense of humor, haha!<br /><br />I hope you will enjoy this Amazing Flight in Time and Space. Thanks for your support as always, looking forward to reading your comments.<br /><br />You can pre-order the album, signed by me, here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.merchandise.nu/en/collections/star-one">https://www.merchandise.nu/en/collections/star-one</a><br /><br />Be excellent to each other!<br />Arjen.<br /><br />Credits:<br /><br />David Brodsky for My Good Eye: Music Visuals – Director, Storyline Cinematography for Narrative, Editing, Post-Production Effects<br />Allison Woest for My Good Eye: Music Visuals – Producer, Storyline Cinematography for Narrative, Editing<br />Adam Pernick - Grip/Electric<br />Robb Brown - Production Assistant<br />TheMike Compitello - Additional Production<br />Lori Linstruth - Musician Cinematography for Arjen Lucassen, Joost van den Broek, Ed Warby<br />Adrian Vandenberg - Musician Cinematography for Adrian Vandenberg<br />Teaser edited by Elan Lopez<br /><br />Starring:<br />lead vocals: Brandon Yeagley <br />historic figures: Etzer Dijkstra, Chip Moody, Billy McCall, Julia Potapoff, Will Shaw, Alex Six, Nicole Six, Sarah Teets, Johannes Van Woerkom, Jim West<br /><br />Musicians:<br />Ed Warby - drums<br />Joost van den Broek - Hammond<br />Marcela Bovio and Irene Jansen - backing vocals<br />Arjen Anthony Lucassen – bass and guitars<br />Featuring: Adrian Vandenberg – lead guitar<br /><br />Thanks so much to everyone involved in the making of this clip.
