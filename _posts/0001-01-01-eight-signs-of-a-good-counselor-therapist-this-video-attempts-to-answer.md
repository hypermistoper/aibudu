{% raw %}This video attempts to answer the question? What are these signs of a good counselor? When I use the term counselor, I'm really referring to anyone who uses psychotherapy, so professional counselors, social workers, psychologists and other people who use psychotherapy. I'm going to list eight signs of a good counselor and these signs of course don't guarantee that somebody's a good counselor, rather they're just indications that I've seen throughout my career that tend to point to an effective mental health clinician. <br /><br />1. Being willing to challenge a client in a helpful manner<br />2. Returning to the original topic in counseling and a session<br />3. Being realistic<br />4. Intellectual curiosity <br />5. Reading the research<br />6. Knowing when to stop talking<br />7. Promoting independence<br />8. Pointing out something a client is trying to express{% endraw %}
