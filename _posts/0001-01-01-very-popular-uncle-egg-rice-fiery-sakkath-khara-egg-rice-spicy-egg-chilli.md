Out here, the egg rice is spicy and punchy, with cooks bringing their own unique blend of seasoning and ingredients to the egg and rice mix. Every neighbourhood boasts of its popular egg rice haunt, and in Banashankari, South Bengaluru, egg lovers make a beeline for Uncle Egg Rice. Hailing from Nanjangud, Nanjunda, or Uncle as he is commonly referred to by his customers, came to Bengaluru from Mysuru with dreams of setting up a food venture after losing his job in an eatery back home. That was 20 years ago, and since then his egg cart, Uncle Egg Rice, seems to have amassed a loyal following for his ‘eggy’ creations, especially the fiery egg rice and creamy egg chilli that I savoured when I visited here on a nippy evening.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy this spicy vlog.
