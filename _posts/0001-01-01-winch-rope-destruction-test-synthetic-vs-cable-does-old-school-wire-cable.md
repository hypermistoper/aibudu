{% raw %}Does old-school wire cable still have a place on your winch, or is modern synthetic rope the only way to go? <br /><br />What we want to say from the start, this is a case study, not a brand specific comparison. This is a big one though, testing the breaking strains of similar sized synthetic winch rope and wire cable on the same NATA test bed we used for our snatch strap comparison back in #12 and the shackle destruction-test we ran in the last issue (CLICK HERE TO READ THAT). We wanted to see what would happen when each of these winch cables were pushed to their limits. How would they break, where would they break and what could we all learn from this exercise? So we went out to our local 4WD shop, purchased the required equipment (no sponsors on this test - we funded the entire operation) and went back to the Nobles lab in Western Sydney. All that is left to do now is test them to destruction, so you can draw your own conclusions as to which cable will best suit your needs.<br /><br />Donâ€™t forget to like, subscribe and leave comments on our videos below<br /><br />For more reviews, gear, news, and anything in-between in the 4WD industry visit<br /><br />Our Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.unsealed4x4.com.au">https://www.unsealed4x4.com.au</a><br />Our Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/unsealed4X4">https://www.facebook.com/unsealed4X4</a>{% endraw %}
