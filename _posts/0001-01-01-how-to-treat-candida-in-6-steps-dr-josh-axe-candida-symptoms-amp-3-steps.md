{% raw %}Candida Symptoms &amp; 3 Steps to Treat Candida: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2RV4XxQ">http://bit.ly/2RV4XxQ</a><br /><br />In today’s video, I’m going to share the exact diet, treatment, and supplements you need to help clear candida from your body. Candida is the overgrowth of bad bacteria in your body and includes symptoms like fatigue, leaky gut, yeast infections, cold &amp; flu, digestive issues, bad breath, or a sluggish metabolism. <br /><br />6 Steps to Treat Candida:<br />1.     Stop consuming so much sugar (especially processed sugar)<br />2.     Eliminate grains from your diet<br />3.     Support your spleen<br />4.     Support your liver<br />5.     Support your intestines<br />6.     Take a probiotic supplement<br /><br />Bonus: I’d recommend an anti-fungal like an oil of oregano or grapeseed extract for a maximum 10-14 day period and stay away from cold foods. If you follow these 6 steps, you should see great results in eliminating candida from your body.<br />--------------------<br />Dr. Josh Axe, DC, DNM, CNS, is a doctor of chiropractic, certified doctor of natural medicine and clinical nutritionist with a passion to help people eat healthy and live a healthy lifestyle.<br />Visit the blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2T6NPBR">http://bit.ly/2T6NPBR</a><br />--------------------<br />Want to connect on social media?<br />Like on Facebook → facebook.com/drjoshaxe/<br />Follow on Instagram → instagram.com/drjoshaxe/<br />Follow on Twitter → twitter.com/drjoshaxe/<br />Follow on Pinterest → pinterest.com/draxe/<br />--------------------<br />Have any questions?<br />Ask away → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2DqymXS">http://bit.ly/2DqymXS</a><br />--------------------<br />This content is strictly the opinion of Dr. Josh Axe and is for informational and educational purposes only.
