{% raw %}Mt. Borah's Chicken Out Ridge is a small section of the climb to 12,662 ft.  The rest of the mountain is a steep hike over mostly rocky terrain- over 5,000 ft in about 4 miles. The rest of the climb can be seen in my other video here- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/6kUgTi5rh9Y">https://youtu.be/6kUgTi5rh9Y</a>{% endraw %}
