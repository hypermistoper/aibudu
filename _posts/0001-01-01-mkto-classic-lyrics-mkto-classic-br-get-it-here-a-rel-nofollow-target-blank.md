Where's the drums?<br />Woo, oh, oh, oh<br />Let's go!<br /><br /> Ooh, girl, you're shining like a 5th Avenue diamond<br />And they don't make you like they used to<br />You're never going out of style<br />Ooh, pretty baby, this world might have gone crazy<br />The way you saved me, who could blame me?<br />When I just wanna make you smile?<br /><br /> I wanna thrill you like Michael<br />I wanna kiss you like Prince<br />Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway<br />Write a song for you like this<br /><br /> You're over my head, I'm out of my mind<br />Thinking I was born in the wrong time<br />One of a kind, living in a world gone plastic<br />Baby, you're so classic (Yeah, yeah, so classic)<br />Baby, you're so classic (Baby you)<br />Baby, you're so classic<br /><br /> Four dozen roses, anything for you to notice<br />All the way to serenade you, doing it Sinatra style<br />I'ma pick you up in a Cadillac, like a gentleman bringing glamour back<br />Keep it real to real in the way I feel<br />I could walk you down the aisle<br /><br /> I wanna thrill you like Michael<br />I wanna kiss you like Prince<br />Let's get it on like Marvin Gaye, like Hathaway<br />Write a song for you like this<br /><br /> You're over my head, I'm out of my mind<br />Thinking I was born in the wrong time<br />It's love on rewind, everything is so throwback-ish<br />I kinda like it how yaâ€”<br />Out of my league, old school chic<br />Like a movie star from a silver screen<br />You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic<br />Baby, you're so classic<br />Baby, you're so classic<br />Baby, you're so classic<br /><br /> Baby, you're class, and baby you're sick<br />I never met a girl like you ever till we met<br />A star in the '40s, centerfold in the '50s<br />Got me trippin' out like the '60s, hippies<br />Queen of the discotheque<br />A '70s dream and an '80s best<br />Hepburn, BeyoncÃ©, Marilyn, massive<br />Girl, you're timeless, just so classic<br /><br /> You're over my head, I'm out of my mind (My, my, my, my mind)<br />Thinking I was born in the wrong time<br />It's love on rewind (Love on rewind), everything is so throwback-ish<br />I kinda like it how yaâ€”<br />Out of my league, old school chic<br />Like a movie star from a silver screen<br />You're one of a kind, living in a world gone plastic<br />Baby, you're so classic (Ooh-woah, ooh-woah-oh)<br />Baby, you're so classic<br />Baby, you're so classic (Ooh)<br /><br />Lyric video for Classic  by MKTO  on Dan Music<br /><br />Contact - danmusicwork@gmail.co.com<br /><br />Tags:{% endraw %}
