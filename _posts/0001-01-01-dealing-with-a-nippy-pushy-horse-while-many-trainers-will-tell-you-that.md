{% raw %}While many trainers will tell you that the way to deal with a horse that nips or pushes into your space is to &quot;give him a good smack&quot; or &quot;make the horse move its feet to show him who's boss&quot;, Josh Nichol has a very different way of dealing with such behaviors. In this video, shot during a clinic in the Yukon, Josh demonstrates his Relational Horsemanship approach to working with a horse that nips, pushes into his owner's space, and has a hard time staying present and focused. Watch as Josh uses clear spatial communication to help the horse settle mentally, which makes the nipping, pushiness, and distractibility simply disappear.<br /><br />To learn more about Josh's unique Relational Horsemanship training and his popular online learning program, visit JoshNichol.com, #RELATIONALHORSEMANSHIP on Twitter, and @AHORSEMANSPURSUIT on Facebook and Instagram.{% endraw %}
