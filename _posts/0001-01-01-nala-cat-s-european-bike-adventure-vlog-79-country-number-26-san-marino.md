{% raw %}COUNTRY NUMBER 26 - San Marino🇸🇲 😻<br /><br />With San Marino kind of being on our route, we thought we'd stop by for a few days and add another country to the list ♥️  Unfortunately we didn't realise just how steep the hills were to get there 😰 after what seemed like forever, we eventually managed to get to San Marino and based on what we saw while getting there, we can't wait to see the view in the morning 😍 <br /><br />Part 2 of our San Marino stop will be up soon, so click the link to watch our day exploring the area  <br />👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/8gXax-od6j0">https://youtu.be/8gXax-od6j0</a><br /><br />TURN ON SUBTITLES ❤️ <br />Our channel now has subtitles for the (majority of) people who don't have a clue what I'm saying.
