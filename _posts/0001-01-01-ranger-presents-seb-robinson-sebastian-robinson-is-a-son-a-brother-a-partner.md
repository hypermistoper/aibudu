{% raw %}'Sebastian Robinson is a Son, a brother, a partner and a bloody good mate to many. The R44 is an extension of his arms and feet, and he flies these machines with absolute precision and care. He's the best pilot I know, and look forward to so many more adventures together in the future.' - Nick Joyce (friend and photographer){% endraw %}
