{% raw %}G'day everyone,<br /><br />In this video I will be making some upgrades to the $200 CNC 3018 which I picked up a while back. Whilst it is amazing that I can buy a CNC machine for this amount of money, it does suffer from issues regarding rigidity.<br /><br />Since it is such an inexpensive machine, it is hard to justify spending large amount of money to upgrade this machine, but for a small amount of money it is possible to make small gains which I would like to share.<br /><br />Here I will be upgrading the anti backlash springs and strengthening the gantry with a new 400mm linear rail. <br /><br />#CNC #CNC3018 #DIY<br /><br />Timestamps<br />0:00 - Intro<br />1:45 - Upgrading The Anti Backlash Springs<br />3:01 - Upgrading The Gantry Support With Linear Rails<br />4:22 - Machining Brass Stand offs<br />5:35 - Modifying The Z Axis Assembly <br />7:19 - Modifying The Gantry Supports <br />8:00 - Modifying The linear Rail <br />9:22 - Assembly<br />10:35 - Engraving Aluminium{% endraw %}
