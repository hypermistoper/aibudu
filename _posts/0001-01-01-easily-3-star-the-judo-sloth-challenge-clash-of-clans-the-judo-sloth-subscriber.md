{% raw %}The Judo Sloth Subscriber Challenge is in Clash of Clans!! Learn how to complete the New Event with this tutorial guide. This Special Judo Sloth Challenge was designed from Subscriber comments. I tried to assure the Challenge had skilled options but was also able to be beaten by all players; so a spam style attack can be used too! The Hero Skins and Base Scenery was also chosen from Subscriber Polls and I am so privileged that we have been selected to be featured in game like this. It is an honour for our channel. I do hope Clash of Clans continue to feature creators and their communities like this; which I am sure they will. It was amazing to win this opportunity from our 1 Million Subscriber Special.
