The planets have all been identified for a long time, rovers have been traveling on Mars for a while, comets and asteroids have been almost counted by name, and even the soil from one of them was taken and delivered to Earth for research. But this is where the scientists were dumbfounded. It turns out that our entire solar system, including the far, far away Oort cloud located at a distance of a light year from the Sun, is immersed in a giant bubble! Its diameter is 1000 light years. And what is remarkable, our Sun is practically in the center of this bubble! Are we really living in a huge bubble?!
