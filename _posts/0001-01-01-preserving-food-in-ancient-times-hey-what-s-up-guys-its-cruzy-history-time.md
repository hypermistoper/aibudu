{% raw %}Hey what's up guys its CRUZY HISTORY TIME, today I will be explaining how foods were stored before refrigerators were even invented! Early civilizations such as Ancient Egypt, Ancient Rome, Native American Tribes and Cowboys all used similar methods of preserving foods/drinks in edible and fresh condition. Salt and Honey were great preservatives, that were used to prevent meat and other products from spoiling and producing harmful bacteria. Smoking and drying meat were essential when conserving meat after cooking, preventing the waste of valuable food resources. <br />My channel covers content about all history topics that include animation style and documentary. If you watch my amazing content, you will learn something! I upload once a week so stay tuned........ THANK YOU!{% endraw %}
