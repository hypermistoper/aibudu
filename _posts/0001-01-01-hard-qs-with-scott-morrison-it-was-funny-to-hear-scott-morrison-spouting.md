{% raw %}It was funny to hear Scott Morrison spouting that he always dealt with the hard questions this week. After all, this is a PM that has built a reputation of doing anything but answer tough questions. Go missing in a crisis? Sure. Answer hard questions? Not so much.<br /><br />Anyway, let’s not pretend Morrison is the first politician to duck tough questions. It can be a political talent, and I’m sure it’s easy to dig up examples of nearly every politician no matter the stripes. It’s just that Morrison has taken it to a whole new level, which is why hearing him suggest that he is always there to deal with the hard questions caused my coffee to spurt out of my nose.<br /><br />There’s a pattern to his technique, and once you’ve seen it, you can’t unsee it.<br /><br />Here’s the link to the Questions on Notice search:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Chamber_documents/Senate_chamber_documents/qon">https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Chamber_documents/Senate_chamber_documents/qon</a><br /><br />If you want to shout me a coffee to say thanks or show support, feel free to hit up my patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/swollenpickles">https://www.patreon.com/swollenpickles</a>{% endraw %}
