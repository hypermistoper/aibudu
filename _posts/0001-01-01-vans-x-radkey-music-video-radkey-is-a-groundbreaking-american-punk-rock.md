{% raw %}Radkey is a groundbreaking American punk rock band from St. Joseph, Missouri. Formed by three brothers: Isaiah, Solomon, and Dee Radke in 2010. Since then, they’ve worked alongside artists like Jack White and The Offspring, and have toured a multitude of shows and festivals across the globe. For this project, they created a music video for their song P.A.W. where they look to challenge racial and social discrimination, shift perspectives, and spark a conversation.<br /><br />To see the full P.A.W. by Radkey please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwD09726atI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwD09726atI</a><br /><br />To see all projects go to vans.com/offthewall<br /><br /><br />Subscribe now at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/vans?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/vans?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Connect with Vans: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.vans.com   ">http://www.vans.com   </a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/vans">http://www.facebook.com/vans</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/vans_66">http://www.twitter.com/vans_66</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/vans">http://www.instagram.com/vans</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.tiktok.com/@vans">http://www.tiktok.com/@vans</a><br /><br />About Vans:<br />Vans®, a VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC) brand, is the original action sports footwear, apparel, and accessories brand.
