{% raw %}Click here for the full episode, including the extended interview with Lev Golinkin on disinformation, weapons manufacturers, and Aaron’s fight with a bloody normal Nazi denier: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://usefulidiots.substack.com/p/extended-episode-ukrainian-journalist?r=je5va&amp;s=w&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web">https://usefulidiots.substack.com/p/extended-episode-ukrainian-journalist?r=je5va&amp;s=w&amp;utm_campaign=post&amp;utm_medium=web</a><br /><br />The Nation’s Lev Golinkin has an important message that most people in mainstream news can’t seem to wrap their heads around:<br /><br />“Russia is committing war crimes. That is true. And not everyone who is fighting Russia is a good guy. That is also true.”<br /><br />And some of these bad guys are Nazis.<br /><br />Lev, who sees his home country being terrorized by Russia while also by it’s own neo-Nazi extremists, brings a new perspective to the war that is rarely shared.<br /><br />And why is his voice stifled? Because of disinformation launderers like Nina Jankowicz, Orwellian head of Biden’s (now-paused) Disinformation Board, who have a pro-war agenda, whitewash Nazism, and smear anyone who disagrees with them.<br /><br />Read Lev’s articles at the Nation, read his memoir, and watch Useful Idiots. It’s the last stand against the supercalifragicensors.<br /><br />And become a Substack subscriber to see the full interview where we discuss disinformation, weapons manufacturers, and Aaron’s fight with a Nazi denier.<br /><br />It’s all this, and more, on this week’s episode of Useful Idiots.
