{% raw %}Recessed into the wall or ceiling, it is stylish and unobtrusive, even in the smallest space. The quiet iCON axial fan has been designed with simplicity in mind. A quick, core drilled hole enables immediate fixing of iCON 15. The twist on/off cover requires only a single side entry fixing screw. <br />The optional 'snap-in' module is quick to fit and wire. <br /><br />iCON Range: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.airflow.com/products/icon-range">https://www.airflow.com/products/icon-range</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.airflow.com/iconhalopage">https://www.airflow.com/iconhalopage</a><br /><br />Social Media:<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AirflowD">https://twitter.com/AirflowD</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AirflowDevelopments">https://www.facebook.com/AirflowDevelopments</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/airflowdevelopmentsltd/">https://www.instagram.com/airflowdevelopmentsltd/</a><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/2564582/admin/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/2564582/admin/</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/AirflowD/">https://www.pinterest.co.uk/AirflowD/</a>{% endraw %}
