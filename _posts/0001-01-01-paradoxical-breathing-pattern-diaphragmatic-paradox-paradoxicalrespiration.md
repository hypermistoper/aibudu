{% raw %}Diaphragmatic paradox : watch video of a real patient , learn paradoxical respiration pattern.<br /><br />learn types &amp; mecganism of Neurogenic &amp; Non-neurogenic.<br /><br /><br /><br />What is normal breathing pattern?<br /><br />1. During normal respiration, chest and abdomen inflates with inspiration in a synchronous way.<br /><br />(REASON: downward movement of diaphragm pushes the abdominal contents downwards as the <br /><br />ribs are lifted and moved out.)<br /><br />2. While in expiration, both deflate in synchrony.<br /><br /><br /><br />Paradoxical breathing (neurogenic)<br /><br />In this ,the diaphragm moves UP rather than DOWN  during  inspiration. <br /><br />The abdomen moves IN as the chest expands.<br /><br />This is seen in diaphragm palsy secondary to cervical cord lesions, GBS etc.<br /><br /><br /><br />In non-neurogenic paradoxical breathing:<br /><br />Due to increase work of breathing,there occurs indrawing of intercostal muscles, leading to chest indrawing while inspiration.<br /><br />And there is movement of abdomen in the opposite direction to the chest.<br /><br />Paradoxical breathing is aka see-saw breathing.<br /><br /><br /><br />Identifying this type of breathing is very important as it is a sign of impending respiratory failure and patient requires immediate intubation and ventilator support.<br /><br />#neurology #respiration #respiratory #diaphragm #diaphragmaticbreathing  #paradox<br /><br />ðŸŽµ Song: 'Sappheiros - Embrace' is under a creative commons license license.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxLKyBhC6igFhLEb0gxvQNgâ€‹">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxLKyBhC6igFhLEb0gxvQNgâ€‹</a><br />ðŸŽ¶ Music promoted by BreakingCopyright:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DzYp5uqixz0">https://youtu.be/DzYp5uqixz0</a>{% endraw %}
