For example, if you want to describe something positively, you would use adjectives such as &quot;Nice, Good&quot;, or negatively using adjectives such as &quot;Bad&quot;. In this lesson, you will learn some alternatives to simple adjectives and simple verbs that you use daily. <br /><br />Improving your English vocabulary is the first step in improving your overall English level. Substituting simple words would make you sound more professional and advanced while trying to communicate in English. <br /><br />Receive free PDF files of lesson summaries: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pocenglish.com/">https://pocenglish.com/</a><br /><br />Cheers!{% endraw %}
