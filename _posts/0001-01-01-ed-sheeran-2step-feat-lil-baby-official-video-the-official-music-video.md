/><br />Lyrics: <br />I had a bad week<br />Spent the evening pretending it wasn’t that deep<br />You could see in my eyes that it was taking over<br />I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment<br /><br />You know you take all of my stress right down<br />Help me get it off my chest and out<br />Into the ether with the rest of this mess<br />That just keeps us depressed<br />We forget that we’re here right now<br /><br />‘Coz we’re living life at a different pace<br />Stuck in a constant race keep the pressure on<br />You’re bound to break<br />Something’s got to change <br />We should just be cancelling all our plans<br />And not give a damn <br />If we’re missing out on what the people think is right<br /><br />Seeing through a picture behind the screen<br />And forget to be, lose the conversation for the message that you’ll never read<br />I think maybe you and me <br />Oh we should head out to the place where the music plays<br /><br />And then we’ll go all night<br /><br />Two stepping with the woman I love<br />All my troubles turn to nothing when I’m in your eyes<br />Electrified, we’ll keep turning up and go all night<br />Oh we had dips and falls in our time<br />But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone and then loved<br />And all we need is us to go<br />All night, night<br />Two stepping with the woman I love<br />Night, yeah, all we need is us<br /><br />Baby<br />Sun coming up when we walk out<br />We lost the track of time<br />Everything that I been dealing with ain’t even cross my mind <br />I don’t see nobody in here but us for real<br />For you I’m blind<br />We go anywhere<br />It don’t take much for us to catch a vibe<br /><br />Come here I need to tell you something<br />Let me whisper in your ear<br />Do whatever to get you there I’ll put you on a Lear<br />Private island for a month straight<br />They’ll think you disappeared<br />Lamb truck look good on ya<br />I’m copping you that urus<br />I think I’m bout ready to make love in this club<br />Only thing I need is my drank and my drugs<br />I done got on 10 and forgot where I was<br />Some parts I don’t like but this part I love<br /><br />Only me and my guys<br />I been having me a good time<br />You can see it in all in my eyes<br />Two stepping with shorty<br />Got her rocking side to side<br />You should let me know when you get ready to ride cause <br /><br />We’ll go all night<br /><br />Two stepping with the woman I love<br />All my troubles turn to nothing when I’m in your eyes<br />Electrified, we’ll keep turning up and go all night<br />Oh we had dips and falls in our time<br />But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone then loved<br />And all we need is us to go<br />All night, night<br />Two step and with the woman I love<br />Night, yeah, all we need is us to go all night<br />Night, night<br />Two step and with the woman I love<br />Night, yeah, all we need is us to go all night<br /><br />About Ed Sheeran: <br />Ed Sheeran may be the quintessential pop star of the 2010s: an internationally acclaimed, multi-award winning singer/songwriter who seems to acknowledge no boundaries between styles or eras with elements of folk, hip-hop, pop, dance, soul, and rock woven throughout his music. <br /><br />His incredible catalogue includes the studio albums ‘+’ (plus), ‘x’ (multiply) and ‘÷’ (divide) which spawned hit singles such as ‘The A team’ , ’Lego House’, ‘Sing', ‘Thinking Out Loud’, ‘Photograph’, ‘Shape Of You’, ‘Castle on The Hill’ and ‘Perfect’. <br /> <br />In 2019, Ed Sheeran released the genre-spanning ‘No.6 Collaborations Project’ which featured a wide-range of artists including ‘Justin Bieber’, ‘Camilla’ Cabello’, ‘Travis Scott’, ‘Eminem’, ‘Cardi B, ‘Paulo Londra’, ‘Bruno Mars’ and ‘Stormzy’ amongst many others, producing hits such as ‘I Don’t Care’, ‘Beautiful People’, ‘South of The Border’ and ‘Take Me Back To London’. <br /> <br />#EdSheeran #LilBaby #2step{% endraw %}
