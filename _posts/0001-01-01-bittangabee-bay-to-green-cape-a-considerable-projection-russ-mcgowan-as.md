{% raw %}As a recreational paddle, Green Cape is conveniently reached with a 15km return paddle out of Bittangabee Bay along a rugged coastline of vivid rock features. A coastline of natural spender but one that has a well deserved reputation for trouble if taken for granted or without cautious weather eye to sea and sky. A paddle designed to avoid an isolated crossing of Disaster Bay to either the Wonboyn River entrance or Greenglade for take-out.<br />Green Cape Lighthouse stands as the most southerly and second tallest of the New South Wales coastal lights. It began operation in 1883 and was decommissioned in 1992 when its duties were taken over by an adjacent steel lattice tower with solar powered light.<br />Green cape projects into what is a notoriously stormy region and many ships have founded upon it and in its lee. In 1886, the Ly-ee-moon sailed onto the rocks directly below the Green Cape Light with the loss of 71 lives in what was to become one of Australia’s worst peacetime maritime disasters. It was in 1798 that Mathew Flinders first recorded of the lushly vegetated promontory of lands forming Green Cape, ’We came abreast of a smooth, sloping point which, from its appearance, and being unnoticed in Captain Cook’s chart, I named Green Cape’. Later, in 1802, Flinders moored within the southern bay of Green Cape and, following the disappearance and loss of eight of his crew after they went ashore in search of fresh water, named Disaster Bay.<br />The traditional custodians of the Country of Green Cape are the Thauaira/Thawa people of the Yuin Nation. Bundooro is the recognised traditional name for the Cape which is believed to have been an important men’s teaching area. Naa-chi (Nadgee Nature Reserve) on the southern side of Tartarerer (Disaster Bay) is said to be the resting place of the Rainbow Serpent.{% endraw %}
