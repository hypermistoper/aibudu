{% raw %}Here we expore the clandestine secret service of WW2.<br /><br />Hugh Verity was a night flight pilot in WWII until 1942 when he volunteered for RAF special duties and became involved in one of the most extraordinary and effective operations of the secret war - flying from Englands Sussex coast in a single-engine Lysander aircraft and landing in German occupied France delivering and collecting agents of the French Resistance in absolute secrecy - by the light of the moon. This is the story of those secret missions by moonlight.<br /><br />Between 1941-44 Diana Viscomtesse de Rosso moved in the shadowy world of secret agents and secret information as a private courier for two of the most powerful spymasters of World War Two.<br /><br />üì∫  It's like Netflix for history...
