{% raw %}Prime Minister's Questions and the Spring Statement with BSL interpretation areavailable on Parliament Live: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/c0392975-5f07-4a53-ae44-9ce9c37f1948">https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/c0392975-5f07-4a53-ae44-9ce9c37f1948</a><br /><br />Prime Minister's Question Time, also referred to as PMQs, takes place every Wednesday the House of Commons sits. It gives MPs the chance to put questions to the Prime Minister or a senior member of the Government.<br /><br />In most cases, the session starts with a routine 'open question' from an MP about the Prime Minister's engagements. MPs can then ask supplementary questions on any subject, often one of current political significance.<br /><br />Immediately after PMQs, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, Rishi Sunak MP, will make a spring statement to give an update on the state of the economy and progress made since the Budget, and to respond to the Office for Budget Responsibility’s forecasts for the economy.<br /><br />You can watch the full debate on Parliament TV: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/c0392975-5f07-4a53-ae44-9ce9c37f1948">https://www.parliamentlive.tv/Event/Index/c0392975-5f07-4a53-ae44-9ce9c37f1948</a><br /><br />Want to find out more about what's happening in the House of Commons this week?
