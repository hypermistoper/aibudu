I created Recruiter Empire from scratch by creating my own recruiting agency 7 years ago leaving my corporate job to go make money online and live the laptop lifestyle, creating content, teaching, coaching, mentoring and helping people learn how to build wealth through recruitment.  This has been the biggest shift in my life and one of the best ways I've been able to help people understand things they don't realize, like LinkedIn Automation tools, artificial intelligence, how to interview people, how to hire candidates, how to get clients and how to become an asset and find a niche where you can generate revenue consistently.  After scaling my agency and creating my latest company, I'm also involved in a software automation startup company called esferas which helps people find data, automate messaging, connections, visits etc. I like to create value for others so that they can help others and build a ripple effect around what I do.{% endraw %}
