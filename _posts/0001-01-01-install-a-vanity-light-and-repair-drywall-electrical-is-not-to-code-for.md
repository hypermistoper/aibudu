{% raw %}Wiring must be placed in a UL approved box.  This wiring is NOT how to do this, even though I did it this way for this video.   Then I had the entire bathroom remodeled after this video was shot. <br /><br />The principles outlined in this video can be applied to small jobs easily taken on by the homeowner.  And remember, as a homeowner, it is within your scope to do whatever you want to improve your own home. Large scale jobs may need city permits and contractor involvement, of course.  <br /><br />Below are some of the tools I used in the creation of this video.  <br /><br />Wire strippers:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MZLbvr">https://amzn.to/2MZLbvr</a><br /><br />Magnetizer:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Gmod1i">https://amzn.to/2Gmod1i</a><br /><br />Homax Texture Spray:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2UOPjB2">https://amzn.to/2UOPjB2</a><br /><br />“Paperless” drywall tape:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2E72vMh">https://amzn.to/2E72vMh</a><br /><br />Every homeowner needs a battery powered drill motor.  This is one of the better units out there.  You pay a little more for it, but  you get what you pay for:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2E4DUHQ">https://amzn.to/2E4DUHQ</a><br /><br />Do it yourself and use the money you’ll save to buy better tools.  Owning a home means you’re going to doing repairs yourself, because you’re a smart, capable soul and this is GOOD for the soul.{% endraw %}
