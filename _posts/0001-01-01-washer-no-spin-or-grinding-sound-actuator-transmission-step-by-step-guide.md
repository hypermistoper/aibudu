{% raw %}This is a quick way to see if the actuator has gone out. Several times I’ve seen a washer make a grinding noise or not spin and just have a very dirty shifter. Sometimes the actuator will be too damaged and you will still have to replace but cleaning and greasing the shifter will give the new actuator a much longer lifespan.<br /><br /><br />Affiliate links<br /><br />3 easy steps to finding the right part that will “Actually fit”<br /><br />1.
