{% raw %}The new 2022 Toyota LandCruiser 300 series has today been awarded a 5 star safety rating from ANCAP, Australasia‚Äôs independent voice on vehicle safety. The first vehicle to hold a 2022 datestamp, the Toyota LandCruiser performed well across all areas of assessment.<br /> <br />The¬†Toyota LandCruiser¬†received the second highest score to date for Vulnerable Road User protection under ANCAP‚Äôs 2020 ‚Äì 2022 protocols, with a score of 81%. The LandCruiser is able to avoid collisions with pedestrians when turning across their path, and showed good performance in all forward pedestrian autonomous emergency braking (AEB) tests, with collisions avoided or mitigated across all scenarios.<br /> <br />‚ÄúThe protection the Toyota LandCruiser offers to vulnerable road users, including pedestrians and cyclists, is impressive for a large SUV,‚Äù said ANCAP Chief Executive Officer, Carla Hoorweg.<br /> <br />The Toyota LandCruiser scored well in the assessment area of Adult Occupant Protection with a score of 89%, although the LandCruiser did present a higher risk to occupants of an oncoming vehicle and the full penalty for vehicle compatibility was applied.<br /> <br />The Toyota LandCruiser is fitted with dual frontal, side chest-protecting and side head-protecting airbags, as well as driver and passenger knee airbags, as standard. While the LandCruiser is not fitted with a centre airbag, prevention of excursion (movement towards the other side of the vehicle) in the far side impact tests was assessed as good, and full points were awarded.<br /> <br />The Toyota LandCruiser also scored full points for protection offered to child occupants in the MPDB and side impact tests, with a score of 88% in this assessment area. However, top tether anchorages are not available in the third row and installation of child restraints is not recommended in these seats.<br /> <br />In the assessment area of Safety Assist, the Toyota LandCruiser performed well with a score of 77%. The LandCruiser is fitted with an AEB ‚Äì Car-to-Car system, which avoided or mitigated collisions in most test scenarios, and a lane support system (LSS).<br /><br />The 5 star safety rating applies to all variants of the Toyota LandCruiser, except the GR Sport, which was not assessed.<br /><br />Thanks for watching  <br />Comment, like, dislike, share! ü§ü  <br />Don't miss next videos, subscribe now ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/5i54Vg">https://goo.gl/5i54Vg</a>  <br /><br />‚úÖ Source: ANCAP<br /><br />üéµ MUSIC used<br />Epidemic Sound ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2OvT1SC">https://bit.ly/2OvT1SC</a> (30 days free)<br />Artlist ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/30ERI6u">https://bit.ly/30ERI6u</a> (60 days free)<br /><br />üì¶ Exclusive CAR FANS products: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youcarstore.com">http://youcarstore.com</a><br /><br />INSTAGRAM ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/youcar_official/">http://www.instagram.com/youcar_official/</a><br />FACEBOOK ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/youcarpress/">http://www.facebook.com/youcarpress/</a>{% endraw %}
