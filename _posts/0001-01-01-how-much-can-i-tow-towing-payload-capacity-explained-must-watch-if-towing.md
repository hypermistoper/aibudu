Ever wonder how much your SUV or truck can tow?  Are you looking to buy a new camper and are wondering if you can safely tow it down the road?  If you answered yes to any of these questions, you have to watch this video!  <br /><br />In this video I breakdown how to figure out your curb weight, GVWR, and GCWR.  I also talk about what those numbers are and why they are important to know.  This is the responsibility of every person towing a trailer or hauling a camper on the road, you must know your numbers and be under the legal weight of your vehicle!
