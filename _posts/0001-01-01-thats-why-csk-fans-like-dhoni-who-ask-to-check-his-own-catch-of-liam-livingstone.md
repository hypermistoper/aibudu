{% raw %}Thats why CSK Fans like Dhoni who ask to Check his own Catch of Liam Livingstone during CSK vs PBKS<br />CSK fans and Cricket fans why Like dhoni there was an example in a match played between CSK vs PBKS today. Liam Livingstone was smashing ball out of the park but against a ball he was Fuller down the leg side, goes for the flick but gets a fine edge. Dhoni dives to his left and catches it but looks the half of the ball was out of the gloves and when he fell down, it brushed the ground. Dhoni in his heart knows it and hardly celebrates even though the bowler is excited. Dhoni signals the square leg umpire to check upstairs and the replay confirms the ball did touch the ground.{% endraw %}
