{% raw %}As our society progresses further in its obsession and reliance on technology, so does our assumption of needing more of everything to be happy.   But true wealth has nothing to do with materialism or our social standing.  <br /><br />Instead, wealth comes from within. It comes from what you give to those in need, what you share with people you love, and from that which you cultivate in yourself.<br /><br />Regardless of what we do—and whether we give money, talent, or time — when we serve others we become better ourselves.  And the more we give, the more we stand to gain purpose, meaning and happiness — all of the things that we look for in life but are so hard to find.<br /><br />“A man’s true wealth is the good he does in this world.” - Khalil Gibran<br /><br />Filmed in Hermanus, South Africa. <br />Featuring Obert Jongwe - (Instagram - @obertjongwe) or (Facebook - obert.jongwe.3)<br />And to learn more about Obert and his work, visit - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rossouwmodern.com/art/obert-jongwe/?v=68caa8201064">https://rossouwmodern.com/art/obert-jongwe/?v=68caa8201064</a><br /><br />All of our films are made possible through the generous support of our patrons.<br />To be part of this journey : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/greenrenaissance">https://www.patreon.com/greenrenaissance</a> <br />If you'd prefer to make once off contribution, our PayPal details are : paypal.me/greenrenaissance<br /><br />Join our YouTube channel to get early access to our films :<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcPPUszZ4-7yzZNgAAYwJjg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcPPUszZ4-7yzZNgAAYwJjg/join</a><br /><br />Who is Green Renaissance?
