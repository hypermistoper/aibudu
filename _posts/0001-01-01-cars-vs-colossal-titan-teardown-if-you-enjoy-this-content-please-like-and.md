{% raw %}If you enjoy this content, please like and Subscribe! It really helps a lot :)<br />Also, come say hi on discord!<br />Since Attack on Titan Final Season is coming out in a few days and people were suggesting I do the colossal titan next, I said why not, sounds perfect!<br />And here it is! I think the titan looks great and huge and menacing and I even managed to add the actual wall that he breaks through in the anime! He breaks through it here too and the cars have to defend everyone from his wrath .... or something like that :D You can make up your own lore to my videos. I added smoke and everything too. He really does look great, and is great to destroy! I hope you enjoy :)<br /><br />Join Discord Server :)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/333ktuSe3B">https://discord.gg/333ktuSe3B</a><br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFHJ50h0N_dyUr9aSm_7vBA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFHJ50h0N_dyUr9aSm_7vBA/join</a><br /><br />If you're feeling generous you can buy me a coffee!
