{% raw %}It is well known that Somatic mutations - mutations in our bodyâ€™s genetic code that accumulate over time - can cause cancer, but their broader role in ageing is less clear<br /><br />Now a team of researchers have measured the somatic mutation rates of a range of mammals and discovered a striking correlation between mutation rate and lifespan. Lending evidence to the theory that somatic mutations are a cause of ageing rather than a result of it.<br /><br />Read the paper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04618-z">https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04618-z</a><br /><br />CORRECTION: at 00:09, 01:40 and 06:09 a stylised animated DNA strand is shown. Although not intended to be an accurate depiction of DNA - the strand is shown with the wrong 'handedness'. The DNA should be 'right-handed'.<br /><br />For more stories like these sign up for the Nature Briefing: An essential round-up of science news, opinion and analysis, free in your inbox every weekday: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://go.nature.com/371OcVF">https://go.nature.com/371OcVF</a>{% endraw %}
