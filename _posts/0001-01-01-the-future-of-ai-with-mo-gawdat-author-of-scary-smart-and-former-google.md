{% raw %}Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has said, “Finding a way to ensure that the advent of digital superintelligence is symbiotic with humanity is the single biggest existential crisis we face.”<br /><br />This quote encapsulates Mo Gawdat’s views and opinions in his best-selling book, Scary Smart, a roadmap detailing and predicting how AI can inevitably take over the human race.<br /><br />Mo Gawdat joins Willy Walker on this week’s Walker Webcast as he breaks down the evolution of AI, humanity’s cognitive limitations in controlling AI’s rapid growth, his biggest fears for the future of AI, its use in war and prevention in future disasters like COVID-19, and our responsibility as users in teaching AI to have “our best interests in mind”.<br /><br />Mo Gawdat describes AI not as machines but as “digital beings with experiences, fears, consciousness, and emotions”, capable of deep learning. He likens them to infants, absorbing every piece of knowledge being fed. “The more data you give them, the more they can see and observe patterns,” he adds.<br /><br />He emphasizes humanity’s refusal to take accountability in raising these “artificially intelligent children”, waiting for the government to control the inescapable doom of them disrupting our lifestyles, economies, political landscapes, and overall welfare.<br /><br />Mo Gawdat continues to warn us of the machine’s ability to sway public reasoning and opinions through social media algorithms.<br /><br />“They’re doing that in billions of recommendations every day…and then you start to realize that we are already in a place where we’re dominated. We’re already being told by the machines what to do.”<br /><br />Tune in to this new episode of the Walker Webcast — The Future of AI with Mo Gawdat, Author of Scary Smart and Former Google X Executive. ▶️<br /><br />Key Points In The Webcast: <br />[02:12] Communication as the key to human dominance and its limitations<br />[06:47] The artificial intelligence takeover is closer than we think<br />[12:40] The evolution of tasks to codes to true AI<br />[20:28] The overwhelmingly fast learning power of current machines and how stopping them can be impossible<br />[24:55] Mo’s biggest fears about AI and comparing smart machines to children<br />[32:25] The inevitable growth of machines bringing forth existential dilemma<br />[24:13] Dispersion of returns and varied portfolios<br />[35:37] The unfathomable capabilities of technology for people outside the field<br />[37:25] How AI manipulates our opinions and beliefs<br />[41:57] COVID proving human’s reactive response to threat and AI’s disinterest in well-being and safety<br />[48:55] The use of AI in war, humanity vs life, and the threat of an AI’s “teenage era”<br />[54:33] Human arrogance and the definition of consciousness<br />[1:00:01] Ethics and our significant role as “parents” to AI <br /><br />GET NOTIFIED about upcoming shows: <br />» Subscribe to our YouTube channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5jhzGBWOTvQku2kLbucGcw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5jhzGBWOTvQku2kLbucGcw</a><br />» See upcoming guests on the #WalkerWebcast here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.walkerdunlop.com/webcasts/">https://www.walkerdunlop.com/webcasts/</a><br /><br />RELATED WEBCASTS: Tune in on Wednesdays for fresh perspectives about leadership, business, the economy, commercial real estate, and more! #WillyWalker hosts a diverse network of leaders as they share wisdom that cuts across industry lines. <br /><br />Check out our previous videos: <br />» Full playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_QkMqEzOkzNmWUe9kpfRJ4213jIh6LNk">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_QkMqEzOkzNmWUe9kpfRJ4213jIh6LNk</a><br /><br />Podcast:<br />» Driven By Insight: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/driven-by-insight/id1540843402">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/driven-by-insight/id1540843402</a> <br /><br />Follow us: <br />» LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/walker-&amp;-dunlop/">https://www.linkedin.com/company/walker-&amp;-dunlop/</a><br />» Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/WalkerDunlop">https://www.facebook.com/WalkerDunlop</a><br />» Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/WalkerDunlop">https://twitter.com/WalkerDunlop</a><br />» Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/walkerdunlop/">https://www.instagram.com/walkerdunlop/</a><br /><br />Subscribe: <br />» Newsletters: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://explore.walkerdunlop.com/subscribe">https://explore.walkerdunlop.com/subscribe</a><br /><br />POSTING POLICY: <br />Please bear in mind that this is a public and professional platform.
