{% raw %}Scary videos go hand in hand with high stakes, and there are just some situations in life you don't even want to begin to picture yourself in. Sometimes amongst all the frights, pulse-pounding jump scares, and skin-crawling horrors, you come across a few that do more than just frighten you — they break your heart in two by making you terrified through inescapable chills. Today, I'm here with a list of creepy videos that is nothing like your average, predictable list; it is a list of 15 scary videos that'll make your hair raise — with ominously dark and mysterious happenings. So turn off the lights and cover yourself in your blanket, because these will likely leave you unsettled and in need of some warmth.<br /> <br />The entries in this list of top 15 creepy videos feature freakish ghost encounters, supernatural occurrences, scary videos that capture paranormal events in a haunted house, mysterious happenings, menacingly eerie recordings, and true instances of hauntings and ghost sightings. With that, these scary videos teem with bone-chilling frights and shudders. Taking this into consideration: if you are seeking a good scare from your screen, these creepy videos may do the job but the fear, chaos, and horror may feel a tad too real. <br /> <br />Even though there are plenty of creepy videos in this list that will leave you freaked out from your wits while you literally shake like a leaf, I do acknowledge that you are also as much a fan of horror as I am — frankly, that's why you and I are here, right? <br /> <br />However, at the same time, we all like keeping safe alongside feeling the most exhilarating emotions that we can experience. The collection of these scary videos would let you feel just that! You get to feel adventurous without truly going through what you would have, had you experienced in person the dire and dreadful events shown in this collection of scary videos. Sounds good, right? Nevertheless, if you get scared too stiff, just keep in mind that you are behind the security of your computer screen — that you are merely observing shivery ghost encounters and are, in fact, well protected in the comfort of your home. That should help with the chills that are certain to run up and down your spine as you watch this list of creepy videos.<br /> <br />Done watching?
