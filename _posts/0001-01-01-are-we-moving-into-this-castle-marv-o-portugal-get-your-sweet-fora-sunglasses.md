Many people dream of living in a medieval castle, with its centuries-old architecture and sweeping views of the countryside. But living in such an ancient structure comes with its own set of challenges.<br /><br />With its thick stone walls and drafty windows, living in a castle can be quite cold. You may think that it's a dream come true living in a castle, but there are definitely drawbacks. <br /><br />In our opinion, Marv√£o Castle is one of the most beautiful and best-preserved castles in all of Portugal.  Perched on top of a steep hill, the views from its ramparts are simply stunning. <br /><br />Despite its age and lack of modern amenities, we believe living in Marv√£o Castle would be an amazing experience. It has plenty of space for living and working, as well as lots of potential for restoration. Its historic charm is truly unmatched and if only the weather was great all year round we would live here for sure. <br /><br />What do you think? Would you live in a castle?
