Consisting of 2 games, Squadron 42 a single player, story driven campaign putting you in the middle of the Vanduul attacks as an up and coming UEE Navy pilot, and Star Citizen, a highly detailed<br />first person MMO set within a persistent universe where there are no limits. This includes, space, and ground aspects, massive spaceships with full interiors and interactions, a full dynamic economy which reacts to the players actions allowing for anything you can imagine. <br />It is all being built on the StarEngine (a modified version of Amazon's Lumberyard Engine).<br />Please bare in mind that this is heavily WIP and in an alpha state in which much of the foundational tech to make it a reality is still being developed. Both games do not have set release dates yet but you can play the alpha build for the PU MMO which makes consistent progress<br />with quarterly patch releases throughout the year.<br /><br />I am an independent content creator and a fan of the game, I am not paid by Cloud Imperium however I do accept ships from them to giveaway to my community but this will by no means influence my opinion or what I say and believe about the project.{% endraw %}
