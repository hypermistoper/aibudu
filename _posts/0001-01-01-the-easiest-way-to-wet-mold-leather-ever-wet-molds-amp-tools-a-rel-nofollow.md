We've been obsessively making these wet molded leather trays for months now, and thanks to our new partnership with Buckleguy we've made a full length tutorial on how to make your own beautifully DIY wet molded leather trays in the easiest way possible. Using these three part leather wet molds made from Baltic Birch, you're able to combine any two leathers you'd like to make absolutely stunning, luxurious valet trays in many different styles. We take you through the whole process, from setting up the wet mold itself to molding the leather, gluing it together, and sewig it up using a saddle stitch -- It's seriously one of my favorite leather crafting projects of all time!{% endraw %}
