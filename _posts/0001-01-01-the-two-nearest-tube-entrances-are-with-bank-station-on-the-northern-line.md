{% raw %}With Bank station on the Northern Line being upgraded, a new entrance is also being constructed that comes out on Cannon Street, and it's REALLY close to the surface entrance to Monument station - but how close?<br /><br />There's only one way to find out, and that's to get out the measuring wheel ... !<br /><br />I will go and measure the distance between the two entrances of Hammersmith aren't But those two stations have the same name - this is definetely the shortest difference between two stations with two different names.<br /><br />More information form TfL about the new entrance on Cannon Street, here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/improvements-and-projects/bank-and-monument">https://tfl.gov.uk/travel-information/improvements-and-projects/bank-and-monument</a>{% endraw %}
