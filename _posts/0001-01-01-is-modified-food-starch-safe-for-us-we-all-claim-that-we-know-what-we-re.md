{% raw %}We all claim that we know what we're supposed to do to eat healthy,  and much of these claims would elude to us eating more veggies, controlling portions and reducing the consumption of processed food and sugar. In theory, those are fantastic ideas. But what if we live a lifestyle where implementing all these great ideas is not possible?  Or What if we eat on a budget or have never been properly guided into how to shop for food.  Let's face it,  Food choices matter and much of that has to do with the ingredients they contain.  <br /><br />Unfortunately for us, we have little to no knowledge about what is displayed on a food label,  specifically the ingredients used and what they do to our bodies if consumed.  We don't know how they're produced, what they're derived from or if the item needs it.  So many questions and no answers.  It's no wonder why people get frustrated with labels and opt to not read them.  <br /><br />In this episode of my Ingredient series,  I will talk about Modified Food Starch, what it is, how it's made and if it's harmful to consume.  I think a good rule of thumb is to avoid consumption of anything modified, however,  not all modified food are considered equal.  Modified Food starch in many cases falls under the category of MSG. Watch my other video here to learn more about that<br /><br />#healthiswealth #nutrition101 #nutrition101bycharles #modifiedfoodstarch #modifiedfood #msg #foodmatters #foodchoicesmatter #healthiswealth #gmofoods #betteringredients #harmfulingredients{% endraw %}
