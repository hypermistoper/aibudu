How did the war break out and which countries are involved in it.<br />The future developments in Ukraine will be significantly important for the relationship between the European Union, the United States and Russia and whether the heavy amount of outside interests from all sides on the country is promoting peace, may be up for debate.<br />Ultimately the citizens will have hard choices to make in the future. To choose between Nato and Russia. To choose between the European Union and the Eurasion Union and to choose between the countrys unity or separation, no matter what happens, it will affect us all.<br /><br />Narrated by Emsoc.<br /><br />MUSIC:<br /><br />Music By The Passion HiFi <br />www.thepassionhifi.com <br />The Passion HiFi - No Logo - Hip Hop Beat / Instrumental<br /><br />Kevin MacLeod  - Dark Fog<br /><br />Kevin MacLeod  - Floating Cities<br /><br />Ros√© Beats - Just A Game{% endraw %}
