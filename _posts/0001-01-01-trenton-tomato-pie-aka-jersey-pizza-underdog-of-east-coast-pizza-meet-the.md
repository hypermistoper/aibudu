Mix on low for 1-2 min or until dough forms into a mass. Increase speed to high and finish mixing for 3-4 more minutes. <br /><br />When dough has become smooth and doesn‚Äôt tear/shear when you tug it, it‚Äôs done. Divide dough into 4 approx 250g pieces. Shape each into a ball as shown @1:21. <br /><br />Place each ball into a well oiled bowl, cover, and refrigerate for 1-2 days. <br /><br />3 hours before you‚Äôd like to eat pizza, pull dough from fridge and allow to come to room temp. <br /><br />---<br />SAUCE<br />‚ñ™1 28oz can whole tomatoes <br />‚ñ™50g or 3 1/2Tbsp tomato paste<br />‚ñ™1g or 1tsp dried oregano<br />‚ñ™1g or 1tsp dried basil <br />‚ñ™Pinch of red chile flakes (¬Ω tsp or so)<br />‚ñ™7g or 1 1/4tsp salt <br />‚ñ™10g or 2 1/3tsp sugar <br />‚ñ™Olive oil <br />‚ñ™3-4 cloves garlic, minced <br /><br />Remove 3 tomatoes from the 28oz can and roughly chop them. <br /><br />Add tomato paste, oregano, basil, chile flake, salt, and sugar into the 28oz can and puree with immersion blender until smooth. <br /><br />Heat a long squeeze of olive oil (about 2-3Tbsp) in a saute pan over med-high. Add garlic. Stir and saute for about 30 sec. Add chopped tomatoes and cook for about a minute until reduced. Add the rest of the tomato puree to the pan. Reduce heat to medium and cook for about 15 min or until the sauce is reduced by half. <br /><br />---<br />SHAPING / BUILDING / BUILDING THE PIZZA<br />‚ñ™Full fat aged Mozzarella <br />‚ñ™Parmesan, grated <br /><br />Preheat oven at highest setting (for me that‚Äôs 550F/290C)  with pizza steel/stone. <br /><br />Grate mozzarella on largest holes of box grater. Place grated cheese in the freezer for about 45min. <br /><br />Flour work surface and one of the doughs, and flip it out on to your work surface and flour the wet/non-floured side of the dough. Flatten dough with your hand then with a rolling pin, roll out into about a 10‚Äù/25cm round. Finish shaping by hand as shown @7:50 until dough is about a 12‚Äù/30cm round. Load dough onto pizza peel that has been well dusted with semolina flour. <br /><br />Spread about 2c/240g of the chilled shredded cheese onto the dough followed by a generoug pinch of grated parm. Add several large spoonfuls of the pizza sauce (about 120g/1/2c total per pizza). Spread slightly, making sure to leave plenty of the surface un-sauced.<br /><br />Load onto the pre-heated pizza steel/stone and cook for 6min. Bottom should be well crisped up. Place onto a wire rack to cool slightly before cutting. <br />---<br /><br />üéßMUSIC: <br />EPIDEMIC SOUND.
