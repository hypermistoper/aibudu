{% raw %}Pressure sandblasting cabinet SBC990P assembly, setup and testing. This upgrade for the workshop has been many years in my plans but after dealing with lots of rusty rims and car parts I finally decided to get a blast cabinet. And not just a blast cabinet - a pressure blast cabinet. Supposedly this version has better flow of media and is more efficient. However, in this video you may see that the efficiency of the cabinet suffers from the inadequate air compressor that just doesn't produce required volume (770 litre/minute) of air. In no way is this video a review video. For my needs it is sufficient. However - the air cleaner filters do clog up quite fast and the visibility inside the cabinet suffers accordingly. A cyclone air cleaner should remedy this situation with an exhaust to the outside. Also bigger air compressor and an air dryer in the pressure air system are definitely needed. I hope to blast hundreds and thousands of rusty parts in the future in this cabinet for future projects!<br /><br />Stay tuned for future videos &amp; thanks for watching!<br /><br />My other videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/DonnDIY/videos">https://www.youtube.com/DonnDIY/videos</a><br />Support me on: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/DonnDIY">https://www.patreon.com/DonnDIY</a><br />Follow me on: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/DonnDIY">https://www.instagram.com/DonnDIY</a><br /><br />#donndiy #sandblasting #workshop<br /><br />Welding equipment borrowed from Spetselektroodi AS, Estonia:<br />Fronius TransSteel 2700 welder<br />Optrel Crystal 2.0 Welding Helmet<br />Hypertherm Powermax 45 XP plasma cutter{% endraw %}
