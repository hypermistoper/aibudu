{% raw %}For today we will discuss another episode about the world's best air-defense ship, “Type 45 destroyer or Daring-class” from the United Kingdom.<br />The Type 45 Destroyer is more than just a ship: it’s a symbol of Britain’s eminent place on the world stage and a powerful deterrent. It is a new class of Anti-Air Warfare Destroyer to replace the Royal Navy's existing Type 42 that had served during the Falklands War, with the last Type 42 being decommissioned in 2013. After the launch of Daring on 1 February 2006 Admiral Sir Alan West, a former First Sea Lord, stated that it would be the Royal Navy's most capable destroyer ever, as well as the world's best air-defense ship.<br /><br />The class is primarily designed for anti-aircraft and anti-missile warfare and is built around the PAAMS or (Sea Viper) air-defense system utilizing the SAMPSON AESA and the S1850M long-range radars. The first three destroyers were assembled by BAE Systems Surface Fleet Solutions from partially prefabricated &quot;blocks&quot; built at different shipyards; the remaining three were built by BAE Systems Maritime Naval Ships. The first ship in the Daring class, HMS Daring, was launched on 1 February 2006 and commissioned on 23 July 2009.<br /><br />Timestamp:<br />00:00 Type 45 Destroyer Intro<br />00:14 Type 45 Destroyer Replace Type 42<br />02:06 Type 45 Destroyer Rising costs <br />02:41 Type 45 Destroyer Design and features<br />03:12 Type 45 Destroyer Armament<br />04:51 Type 45 Destroyer Anti-ship missiles<br />05:24 Type 45 Destroyer Engine<br /><br />All content on Military TV is presented for educational purposes.<br /><br />Subscribe Now : <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0IlEuu4TA9wq1u60tLMqBw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0IlEuu4TA9wq1u60tLMqBw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MilitaryTV.Channel">https://www.facebook.com/MilitaryTV.Channel</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://defense-tv.com/">http://defense-tv.com/</a>{% endraw %}
