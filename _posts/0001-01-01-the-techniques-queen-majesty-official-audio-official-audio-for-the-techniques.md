{% raw %}Official audio for the Techniques' 1967 rock steady classic, 'Queen Majesty'.<br /><br />After forming in the mid-Sixties, the Techniques repeatedly proved themselves to be one of the most popular and influential vocal groups in the history of Jamaican music, recording a formidable number of hit singles, many of which are now rightly regarded as classics.<br /><br />The height of their success occurred during the ska and rock steady years, when, led by such luminaries as of Slim Smith, Pat Kelly and Bruce Ruffin, they scored a succession of major hits for Duke Reidâ€™s legendary Treasure Isle Records.<br /><br />Arguably their greatest triumph during this period was their sublime interpretation of Curtis Mayfield &amp; the Impressions' 1963 r&amp;b hit, 'Minstrel And Queen', which rates as one of the finest recordings of the rock steady era.<br /><br />Follow Trojan Records:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/trojan-...">https://open.spotify.com/user/trojan-...</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TrojanRecords">https://www.facebook.com/TrojanRecords</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trojan_reco...">https://www.instagram.com/trojan_reco...</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/trojanrecords">https://twitter.com/trojanrecords</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.trojanrecords.com/">https://www.trojanrecords.com/</a><br /><br />#Techniques #CurtisMayfield #MajestyAndQueen #QueenMajesty #DukeReid{% endraw %}
