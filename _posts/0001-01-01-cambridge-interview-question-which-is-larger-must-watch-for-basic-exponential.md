{% raw %}Hello, guys. I am posting this interesting Cambridge Interview Question asking which is larger between the square root of 2 or third root of 3. This is a basic exponential expression type of question you should know. Cambridge Interview Questions are pretty interesting that I am planning to cover many of them. Try on yourself. Which is larger? Try before you watch the video until the end. <br /><br />#cambridgeinterviewquestion #exponentialexpression #radicals{% endraw %}
