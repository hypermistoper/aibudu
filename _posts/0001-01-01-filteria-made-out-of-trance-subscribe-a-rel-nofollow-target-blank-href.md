Apr 2022 by Suntrip Records - SUNCD72<br /><br />Filteria is back with &quot;Live With the Lag&quot;, a dazzling 9-track trance &amp; dance experience where the artist demonstrates he can take you anywhere through his melodic mastery!<br />Drawn from his experience of wrecking havoc on countless dancefloors and festivals across the globe, Filteria's 5th studio album connects with the listener's emotions in the original meaning of Goa Trance!<br /><br />From the atmospheric &quot;Filternaut&quot; followed by a trippy and bubbly &quot;ACME Never Failed&quot;, Jannis goes on to the insta-hit &quot;Crimefighter Frog&quot; full of acid lines that shook so many dancefloors!<br />After this warm-up, the tracklist takes you through a cascade of melodies in &quot;Nostalgia&quot;, and the sci-fi cruise &quot;Chase The Future&quot;; before what sounds like a tribute to the nineties with the relaxed &quot;Reploids&quot;, and &quot;Conquer Gravity&quot;, the collaboration with the almighty Pleiadians where both artists styles stand out in the most authentic oldschool form!<br />Filteria closes the album with &quot;4 Stages&quot; and &quot;Made Out Of Trance&quot; two blissful emotional melodic sunrise creations you will crave for in the festival season!<br /><br />As usual the album was carefully mastered by Tim Schuldt.<br />&quot;Live With the Lag&quot; was worth the wait, Filteria didn't make any compromise with what might be his best album to date and remains at the apex of the modern Goa Trance genre!<br /><br />Follow us:<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://suntriprecords.com">https://suntriprecords.com</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/suntriprecords">https://facebook.com/suntriprecords</a><br />SoundCloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/suntrip-records">https://soundcloud.com/suntrip-records</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/suntriprecords">https://instagram.com/suntriprecords</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/suntriprecords">https://twitter.com/suntriprecords</a><br /><br />Goa Trance label from the heart releasing old styled melodic &amp; acidic Goa Trance since 2004! :)<br /><br />You know Filteria?
