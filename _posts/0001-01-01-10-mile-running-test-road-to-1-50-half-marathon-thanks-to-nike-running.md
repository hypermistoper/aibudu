{% raw %}Thanks to @Nike Running for sponsoring this video. #ReactInfinity. Also, filmed before the Shelter in Place order went into effect in the Bay Area. <br /><br />Holly and Morgan take to the beautiful roads and paths wearing the Nike React Infinity Runs, taking in the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz Island, all while testing Holly's fitness and pace to be ready for a 1:50 half marathon. That's 8:23 per mile. Does Holly have what it takes? <br /><br />Join Nike's Project Fearless: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://swoo.sh/2GSstUo">https://swoo.sh/2GSstUo</a><br />Shop Nike React Infinity Run: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://swoo.sh/2x9FR52">https://swoo.sh/2x9FR52</a><br /><br />Start Training with The Run Experience: <br /><br />Download our Training App for workouts, programs, &amp; awesome coaching: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tre.onelink.me/I8YZ/3eb5fc43">https://tre.onelink.me/I8YZ/3eb5fc43</a><br /><br />The 2 Week Quick Start Program is the perfect place to build speed, boost strength, and decrease injury (hint: it's free &amp; also in the app!)<br /> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2NDhzGL">http://bit.ly/2NDhzGL</a>{% endraw %}
