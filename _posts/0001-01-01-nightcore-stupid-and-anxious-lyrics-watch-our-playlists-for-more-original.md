You made me believe that our love was endless.<br />And I'm so naive to think that I'm defenseless. I'm stupid and anxious.<br /><br />Can you just shut up, let me finish a sentence.<br />Just let me finish a sentence.<br />Can you just shut up, let me finish a sentence.<br />Just let me finish a sentence.<br />I'm so god damn sick of my heart getting messed with.<br />I can't see shit through your broken intentions.<br />I hope you hurt like hell cause I'm going to heaven.<br />I can't see shit through your broken intentions.<br /><br />I talk a lot about you now.<br />I talked about how I'd forget this.<br />and even though I learned my lesson I am down.<br />The only one to never sleep alone.<br />Is the freedom fun when you turn off your phone?<br />I guess I'll never know, so just take off your clothes.<br />We can stop at the store<br />and we can drink til we can't think.<br />So, what are you stopping me for?<br />Isn't this what you wanted?<br />Miss Codependent.<br />You made me believe that our love was endless.<br />And I'm so naive to think that I'm defenseless.<br />I'm stupid and anxious.<br />Can you just shut up, let me finish a sentence.<br />Just let me finish a sentence.<br />Can you just shut up, let me finish a sentence.<br />Just let me finish a sentence.<br />I'm so god damn sick of my heart getting messed with.<br />I can't see shit through your broken intentions.<br />I hope you hurt like hell cause I'm going to heaven.<br />I can't see shit through your broken intentions.{% endraw %}
