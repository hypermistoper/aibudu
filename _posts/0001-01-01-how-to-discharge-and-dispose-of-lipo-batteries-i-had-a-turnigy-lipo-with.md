{% raw %}I had a Turnigy LiPo with a dead cell and wondered what to do with it. Instead of waiting for it to spontaneously combust in my garage I decided to research how to discharge and dispose of it.<br /><br />Here are a couple of great references I used during the process of discharging and disposing my Turnigy LiPo battery:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.tjinguytech.com/charging-how-tos/lipo-disposal">http://www.tjinguytech.com/charging-how-tos/lipo-disposal</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.rctoys.com/pdf/thunder-power-disposal-of-old-damaged-lipo-batteries.pdf">http://www.rctoys.com/pdf/thunder-power-disposal-of-old-damaged-lipo-batteries.pdf</a><br /><br />If you have any suggestions I'd love to hear them. Or share how you dispose of your dead LiPos in the comments. Any and all feedback is appreciated.{% endraw %}
