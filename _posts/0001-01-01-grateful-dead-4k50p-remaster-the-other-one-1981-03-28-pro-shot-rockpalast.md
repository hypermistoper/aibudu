{% raw %}I have this show published in its entirety. I did all the editing to get from 480i to 2160p (4k) <br />Set1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/dAaG959JCAA">https://youtu.be/dAaG959JCAA</a><br />set 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/48WZDVNi4es">https://youtu.be/48WZDVNi4es</a><br /><br />___________________<br />If you are able, please  support the continuing upgrades of these videos if you are able, every single dollar goes STRAIGHT TO NEEDED EQUIPMENT!!!: <br /><br />Venmo: @Christopher-Hazard-0<br />Paypal: Christopher.Hazard@utoledo.edu<br />Cashapp: $hazard4k<br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/hazardc">https://www.patreon.com/hazardc</a><br /><br />All donations go STRAIGHT TO EQUIPMENT that is needed to carry out the work needed to get through the amount of video that needs to be processed. This takes a lot of powerful equipment and other associated overhead that  comes with running a bunch of workstations being fully throttled rendering 4k video 24/7. :) <br />____________________________________________{% endraw %}
