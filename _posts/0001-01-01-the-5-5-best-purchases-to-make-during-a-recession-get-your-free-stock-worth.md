Thatâ€™s shocking, but whatâ€™s even more worrying is nobody ever warned us about this. Talking about money is extremely frowned upon, but with the cost of living rising and energy prices soaring, itâ€™s more important than ever.<br />Letâ€™s look at the 5.5 best purchases you can make at the moment to grow your wealth!<br /><br />Number 1: Buying Reliable Stocks<br /><br />Investing in stocks has never been easier and with the right portfolio, you can really take advantage of a stock market crash and build your wealth. <br />There are 3 different types of reliable stocks, such as dividend payers, core sector stocks and of course, Index funds.<br /><br />Number 2: Buying Real Estate<br /><br />The beauty of real estate is that you can leverage your money with mortgages, meaning you can take control of a property worth hundreds of thousands with a much smaller deposit, and then pay back the interest on the loan with the money youâ€™re receiving in rental income, and of course make some profit on the side! <br /><br />Number 3: Buying Precious Metal <br /><br />Robert Kiyosaki author of the popular book rich dad poor dad, is a huge supporter of buying gold and silver, he calls it â€˜godâ€™s moneyâ€™.<br />There are multiple different ways you can purchase precious metal, which I discuss in detail here.<br /><br />Number 4: Buying Blue Chip Crypto<br /><br />Itâ€™s no secret that Bitcoin has been the BEST performing asset of the last decade. And iâ€™m sure I also donâ€™t need to remind you about the state of the market at the moment.. Itâ€™s a blood bath, which could be the perfect time to snap up some amazing deals.<br />Number 5: Buying Things For A Side Hustle Or Business<br />Thereâ€™s lots of different options here such as the online route, or something more physical in person depending on your skill set.<br />This is the absolute best way to get ahead of everybody else during a crash, as cash is king and the more money youâ€™re generating, the more money you can invest.<br /><br />Number 5.5: A Sports Membership<br /><br />Around 2012 I was still dealing with the aftermath of the 2008 recession and therefore my stress levels were very high. So I decided to take up Golf as a way to relax and de-stress. <br />By playing regular sport, I not only improved my health, but also my decision making. This is because I was no longer being driven by stress and could therefore make more logical decisions and take calculated risks<br />_______________________________________<br />CONTACT:<br />For business inquires only, please use this email: mark@marktilbury.com<br /><br />*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies in which Mark Tilbury will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
