Tesla 4680 Battery Cells First Samples Ready To Go!!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/kbJNeIRLf50">https://youtu.be/kbJNeIRLf50</a><br /><br />If you have had any sort of brush against the EV or electric market in the past few years, chances are you have already heard the following story a couple of dozen times. Lithium-Ion batteries have been used for decades, they were good, but now they are not energy-dense enough for transportation applications, are too expensive, have safety concerns, and most importantly are not scalable enough moving forward.<br />And if you‚Äôre familiar with that story, you are probably also familiar with the fact that as of right now, more than half a hundred companies are working pretty hard to develop a solution to that problem.<br />But here‚Äôs the thing, even though there are a lot of solutions trying to obtain stuff like better power numbers, better charging speeds, and a safer way to make them, none of the major options are really working towards a battery that is actually good for the world, not just for a niche application.<br />Because here‚Äôs the thing, as fun as it is to have cars that can charge in 10 minutes and then take you on a 1000-mile journey or whatever, those batteries are potentially the most expensive, environmentally damaging, and impractical solutions in all places except cars.<br />So, what is one to do?<br />Well, according to one Scottish company, the answer lies in the form of an often-overlooked type of cell, the humble Sodium-Ion battery.<br />You see, since 1997, the UK-traded AMTE Power has been one of the foremost manufacturers of high-quality lithium-ion batteries which they have been supplying to a range of markets like automotive, aerospace, defense, oil &amp; gas, and even a recently growing field of interest, renewable energy storage.<br />But over the past few years, they have been focusing more and more on what they think is the natural future of battery technology. As the company puts it<br />‚ÄúAs a battery cell manufacturer, AMTE Power‚Äôs product is central to energy systems ‚Äì we develop cells for use in stationary storage systems, using traditional lithium-ion chemistry as well as developing a range of sodium-ion based solutions.‚Äù<br /><br />___________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />ü§© The Tesla Domain is the Number 1 channel to go when you want to be up to date with the latest Tesla news, rumors, and insights.
