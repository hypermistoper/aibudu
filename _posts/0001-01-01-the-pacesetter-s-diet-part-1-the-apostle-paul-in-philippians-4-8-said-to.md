{% raw %}The Apostle Paul in Philippians 4:8 said to, &quot;think about things that are... true.&quot;  It's easy to think about things that are false; to have a negative outlook on life.  But what if we changed our mental diet; what if we changed our thought patterns, and began to think about positive things?  If we are what we think, it's time to feed from God's Word about things that are for us... the things that are true!{% endraw %}
