All rights reserved.<br /><br />&quot;I rejoice in the singular privilege of being on this remarkable Brigham Young University campus with each of you. This entire center is charged with an ennobling spirit that originates from your individual purity and righteousness. With great depth of feeling I express my love for each of you and my profound gratitude for who you are and what you will accomplish in your lifetime.<br /><br />During the past several years, my life has been powerfully enriched by an assignment that has permitted close collaboration with President Cecil Samuelson and key BYU faculty and administrative staff. Simultaneously, I have had the privilege of meeting the student-body leaders at Brigham Young University and some of the outstanding students enrolled here. These experiences have created in me a deep and abiding respect for this unique university and its precious student body. That respect and appreciation has motivated me to strive to prepare a message that I hope will be of lasting value to you personally.<br /><br />I will speak as though I am conversing with each one of you individually. You may be just beginning your studies at this university. If so, you might feel intimidated by many around you who seem to be well oriented and accomplishing much of great worth, while you may not be sure of how to make the most of your opportunity here. Or you could be a confident student about ready to graduate, having worked hard to benefit from the knowledge and experience available at this unique campus. Perhaps you find yourself somewhere between these two extremes. My desire is to share insights that can benefit each of you personally, now.<br /><br />This message is divided into two parts. First, I will share a scripturally based set of principles intended to provide help at this season of your life. Then, after laying an underpinning with scriptures from the Book of Mormon, I will share counsel regarding an even more significant foundation for your life. As this is done, I feel assured that as you seek to identify this foundation, there will be available to you a greater source of direction—namely, the promptings of the Holy Spirit that can convey a personalized message from the Lord for your guidance. Of all that is communicated today, that direction should receive the highest priority as you try to write or remember what will be shared with you.<br /><br />My soul is deeply stirred when I consider the profound, enduring, and beneficial counsel available to each of us through the priceless scriptures the Lord has prompted His prophets to record. One eloquent example of such a passage is this thoughtful, profoundly insightful counsel of Alma given to the people in Gideon:<br /><br />And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.1<br /><br />In that single verse Alma gives an extremely effective formula for success and happiness in life. Let us analyze it to determine how it can benefit you personally....&quot;{% endraw %}
