{% raw %}To say the bite was good would be an understatement.  We were able to get out before the storm and get on all types of fish from snapper, grouper, grunts, redfish and snook.  We talk about what we look for when fishing an open flat!  Plus we add a little Keys flare with a trip that Chad took down to Marathon.  Hope you enjoy, Fish More, Catch More!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tampabayfishingchannel.com">http://tampabayfishingchannel.com</a>{% endraw %}
