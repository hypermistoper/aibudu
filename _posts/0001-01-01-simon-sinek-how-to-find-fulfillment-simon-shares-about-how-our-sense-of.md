{% raw %}Simon shares about how our sense of fulfillment is directly tied to how generous we are towards others. <br /><br /><br />&quot;You can be happy because you did things at work, you can be proud because you did things at work, you can be excited because you had a big success at work, but you know how you feel fulfilled at work? <br /><br />When you do something for someone else. <br /><br />It's the only way we get that feeling.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Generosity is doing something for someone else and expecting NOTHING in return. At. no. point. ever.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Do you know why the statistics say that over 90% of people don't feel fulfilled by the work they do? It's not because of the job, it's not because of the pay, it's not because of the benefits, it's cause we don't help each other anymore.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I don't care how good your product is, I don't care how good your marketing is, I don't care how good your design is, if you don't understand people, you don't understand business.&quot;<br /><br />--<br /><br />You can find the full version of this talk here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8grVwcPZnuw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8grVwcPZnuw</a><br /><br /><br />--<br /><br />millionaire-by-25.tumblr.com{% endraw %}
