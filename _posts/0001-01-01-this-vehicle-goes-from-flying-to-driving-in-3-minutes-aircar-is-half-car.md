{% raw %}AirCar is half car, half airplane, and it’s just been given an airworthiness certificate by the Slovak Transport Authority. That means this car of the not-so-distant future meets the strict standards of the European Aviation Safety Agency. The AirCar isn’t made for long-haul flights. On just over 7 gallons of gas, the current prototype can fly you about 310 miles. The transformation from aircraft to road-worthy takes less than 3 minutes.{% endraw %}
