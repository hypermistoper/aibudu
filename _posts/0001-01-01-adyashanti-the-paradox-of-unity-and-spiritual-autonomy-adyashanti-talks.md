{% raw %}Adyashanti talks about the changes that arise when the psychological self is seen for what it is, when the sorrow of becoming falls away into effortless being, when the heart starts to come online and the will is finally understood by its absence. A deep paradox arises, the understanding that we are one, and the realization that each individual is unique in itself and unspeakably valuable. This spiritual autonomy has an endless capacity to express itself through its humanity and can become a redemptive presence in the world, helping us all remember who we are.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.scienceandnonduality.com">http://www.scienceandnonduality.com</a><br /><br />Science And NonDuality is a community inspired by timeless wisdom, informed by cutting-edge science, and grounded in personal experience. We come together in an openhearted exploration to explore our individual and collective evolution. New ways of being emerge. We embody our interconnectedness and celebrate our humanity.{% endraw %}
