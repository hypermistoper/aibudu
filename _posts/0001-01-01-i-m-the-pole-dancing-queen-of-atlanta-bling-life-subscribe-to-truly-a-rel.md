She is most noted for co-creating the Snack Pack, whose influence can be seen in almost every area of hip-hop. Gigi has a cult-like following and helped create many of the signature pole tricks still popular today. In fact,  Katori Hall, creator of Starz stripper centred hit show “P-Valley” says that Gigi was the muse for her lead character Mercedes. Nicknamed Ms. Show Me The Money, Gigi was, and to many, is still the reigning queen of Magic City - Atlanta’s most famous strip club. In 2011 after performing her infamous “Last Dance” set, Gigi abruptly left the club scene. But 10 years later she found herself penniless and starting over. She says she had to pick herself up by her bootstraps. Gigi returned to the strip club as a bartender. She has also found success with an OnlyFans page that averages $10k - $12k per month and has even skyrocketed to $22k in the past. Gigi wowed audiences with her out of the box pole antics. Now, 10 years later, Gigi will return to the stage for one night only to celebrate her 43rd birthday! Gigi told Truly: “I don’t really feel like I had a chance to retire the way I wanted to and this night is about a therapeutic release.&quot; Gigi says: “I am proud of myself. I wanted to prove that I could provide a life-sytle of luxury for myself, by myself..  And I am doing that.&quot;<br /><br />Follow Gigi:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gigimaguire/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/gigimaguire/?hl=en</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gigimaguire?lang=en">https://twitter.com/gigimaguire?lang=en</a> <br /><br />Videographer: Angelica “Ruby” Collins &amp; Lydia Fiyori <br />Producers: Emika Berry<br />Editor: Stephan Phillips<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
