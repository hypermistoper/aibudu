{% raw %}In the book of Boba Fett episode 6 directed by Dave Filoni we got an amazing reveal of new characters and storylines evolving. Cad Bane was definitely a big surprise and brings a new level of threat to live action Star Wars. I can’t wait to see what happens with him and Boba Fett.<br />But today’s video is going to be about Grogu and what he saw during Order 66 as the 501st clones treaded down upon the three Jedi protecting him. I’ll go over the Jedi more in another video, however today I want to discuss how I think Jocasta Nu saved Grogu.<br /><br />You see, in the comics, Jocasta was still alive long after Order 66. She remained in the temple and protected the archives, namely, the restricted section. The very same archives that housed the dark saber for many years after the death of Tarre Vizsla. It was here that she found the grand inquisitor, as well as Vader himself. Now, Vader was after her because she possessed the data drive that had all the force sensitive children in the galaxy known to the Jedi and where to find them. This was the Jedi order’s list of new force sensitives to recruit. They would find these children, and bring them back to the temple to be trained from infancy. This was very valuable to Palpatine and Vader for many reasons. 1 to complete Order 66. 2. To possibly be used for Palpatine’s experiments with cloning force sensitives or harbouring their blood as he tried with Grogu in the Mandalorian and 3. For Palpatine to replace Vader with now that he isn’t as strong as Anakin Skywalker would have been had he not lost to Obi-Wan Kenobi on Mustafar. <br /><br />Vader apprehends Jocasta and if you want to see the full story in order of comics released, you can either buy the Marvel comics, or check out my coverage and explanation of them on the channel with sound fx, voice acting and music. Vader grabbed the data chip from her and saw all the names when plugging it into his ocular lenses. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P29v5GtoaXw&amp;t=4s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P29v5GtoaXw&amp;t=4s</a><br /><br />Jocasta Nu met her untimely demise at the hands of Vader aboard an LAAT gunship and then immediately crushed the data chip with all the names of force sensitives, locations, and birthdays. He wouldn’t ever be replaced by the Emperor, and so he destroyed the chip and when Palpatine asked him if he found anything of value, he lied telling his master, no, nothing.<br /><br />The treachery amongst the Sith knows no bounds.<br />Vader destroying this information might have done more harm than good. It would have been valuable to know the list of many future Jedi or Sith out there, but now we may never know.<br /><br />I believe it was Jocasta Nu who saved Grogu. He was heavily guarded, and maybe there were more younglings who were being guarded, but for now it looks like it was just him. I believe he was a special case in the sense that he was very rare. We’ve only seen 3 yoda species in Star Wars to date, yoda, yadel, and now Grogu. <br />I believe Grogu was extremely powerful and may have been able to stop that wave of 501st troopers, allowing Jocasta to get him to safety behind a closed door or hidden wall. Either that, or, Grogu was already safe and he was watching what was happening on a giant security monitor where Jocasta had taken him.<br /><br />Jocasta was alive for several months after Revenge of the Sith, this gave her enough time to get Grogu off world, or to keep him with her under her watchful eye. What could have happened was, she wiped his memory when things got a bit dangerous. When the Empire began to take control of the Jedi temple and she saw the shock troopers coming in. Then when the grand inquisitor arrived and then Vader soon after, that could have been when she wiped Grogu’s memory and then possibly shipped him off somewhere on auto pilot, or sadly left him at the temple where the Empire found him and brought him to Palpatine. I like to think she sent him off to someone and his journey and adventure surviving order 66 begins with that person, who eventually falls to the empire, maybe an inquisitor or Vader himself, and has his mind wiped then and there as he’s captured.<br /><br />I’m very excited to discover more behind Grogu’s experience with order 66 and his survival as well as his interactions and abilities during his time at the Jedi temple with yoda, Mace Windu, Dooku, qui-gon and more.<br /><br /><br />Comic video explaining Vader against Jocasta Nu in canon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P29v5GtoaXw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P29v5GtoaXw</a><br /><br /><br />Continue the conversation on the Theory forums!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://starwarstheory.com/THEORY/posts">https://starwarstheory.com/THEORY/posts</a><br /><br />Become a Patron to support future content - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheory">https://www.patreon.com/StarWarsTheory</a><br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8CbFnDTYkiVweaz8y9wd_Q/join</a>{% endraw %}
