{% raw %}I wanted to get better at drawing animals, so I tried challenging myself to draw at least 50 animals for the homework of Drawabox Lesson 5.<br /><br />The first drawing was made on 28th August, 2020 and the last one on 5th of April, 2021. Even though at one point I drew for nearly 30 days straight, it still took me around 7 months in total due to the long breaks I had in between drawings sometimes.<br />Also, I didn't show those pages in the video, but when I didn't feel like drawing an animal for the challenge, I sometimes drew completely random things like the default OSRS character through construction and such to avoid not drawing at all. For warmup, I just drew circles mostly.<br /><br />MUSIC:<br />Opoona OST - スペース・シップ<br />遊戯王デュエルモンスターズ OST - 華麗なる舞<br />Opoona OST - 記憶のない村<br />________________________________<br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Livakivi">https://www.patreon.com/Livakivi</a><br />PayPal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/EhaSoft">https://paypal.me/EhaSoft</a><br />Migaku reflink (1 extra month for free + support the channel): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://migaku.io/free-month/Livakivi">https://migaku.io/free-month/Livakivi</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Livakivi">https://twitter.com/Livakivi</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/w6qyB5mpWa">https://discord.com/invite/w6qyB5mpWa</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/Livakivi">https://www.twitch.tv/Livakivi</a><br />Second Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/BudgetLivakivi">https://www.youtube.com/c/BudgetLivakivi</a>{% endraw %}
