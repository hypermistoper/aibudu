{% raw %}Fitting downhill forks on my enduro bike and going for an urban MTB freeride shred! I ride some huge stair sets and gaps before showing you sick final footage from the amazing Cape Town trip, would your ride this bike?<br /><br />Today I do some bike maintenance and fit some Fox 40 downhill forks onto my Haibike electric mountain bike before going for a mini urban MTB freeride shred around my hometown to test what the forks feel like on this bike. After hitting a few Urban MTB freeride zones and feeling that the bike works well we then end the riding in the UK and skip back to the leftover footage from South Africa where I make a mini edit with some awesome clips. Before the edit drops though you will see me chasing Max Fredriksson down the ultimate flow trail out in the plains of Africa and the edit also has a surprise new sound track that i'm sure you will love! So sit back and enjoy some crazy sends and awesome GoPro clips :)<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the video!<br /><br /><br /><br />MERCH:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tothesky.store/">https://www.tothesky.store/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br /><br />Welcome to my channel, I'm a professional Freeride Mountain biker and former FMB world champion(2013).  <br /><br /><br /><br />This channel is all about Mountain biking, I make a huge variety of videos for everyone who loves dirt: From downhill biking to slower paced trials riding and everything in between like dirt jumping, slopestyle and enduro!  <br /><br /><br /><br />As well as making entertaining videos(I hope) I also like to help YOU out too, with videos such as:  <br /><br />- How to ride better <br /><br />- Trick tips and How to's <br /><br />- Travel VLOGS <br /><br />- GoPro camera tips <br /><br />- In-depth entertaining features <br /><br />- POV craziness <br /><br />- Funny videos <br /><br /><br /><br /> I also try to reply to everyone so leave some comments too!{% endraw %}
