All of our content is family friendly and safe for everyone to enjoy.<br /><br />Tennessee denied our super wide permit to move the mobile home. Why? The width of the home is greater than 16 feet wide. With our new roof over addition to the home, the maximum width is 17 feet. We have to find a way to cut our roof down to fit within regulations and re-apply for a permit to move the mobile home!<br /><br />#mobilehome #diy #greenacrehomestead<br /><br />DISCLAIMER*<br />This video and description contains affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the product links, we may receive a small commission at no extra cost to you.
