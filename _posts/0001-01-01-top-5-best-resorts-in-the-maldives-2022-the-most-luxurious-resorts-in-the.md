Service, food, villa, island, snorkeling, spa, everything is very high standard and its location within Baa Atoll (a Unesco Biosphere reserve) enables you to go and enjoy snorkeling with Manta Rays which was one of the best experience we ever had. If you're looking for the best luxury resorts in the Maldives, Vakkaru can be a very good match. <br />Full resort tour : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuB6pEOMRWw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NuB6pEOMRWw</a><br /><br />ü•â The Nautilus<br />If you have done your research about the Maldives, you can't have missed The Nautilus. Indeed, it is very often referred to as one of the best resorts in the Maldives, and very likely the most exclusive one. With only 26 villas and only 11 overwater, The Nautilus offers a special experience to its guests who are looking for top-level service. The food was the best we ever had in any resorts in the Maldives, the villas are huge and extremely comfortable, the service is excellent and so was the Spa. Only drawback was the island itself with big seawalls all around. Yet, if you don't mind having seawalls around, Nautilus might well be the best resort in the Maldives for you ! <br />Full Resort Tour : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNeeTiG4xAk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNeeTiG4xAk</a><br /><br />ü•à Gili Lankanfushi<br />In number 2 of our top 5 best resorts in the Maldives selection for 2022, you'll find Gili Lankanfushi. This 5* luxury resort offers everything you can look for when booking your vacation. The villas are insane, the island is beautiful, the service is the best we've ever had, the food was delicious and its proximity to Male make it super easy to access. The only weakness we could spot was the lack of snorkeling but everything else is so incredible that you can forget it..a bit ;) Gili Lankanfushi is really a resort we loved and totally deserves its #2 position among the best hotels in the Maldives for 2022. <br />Full Resort Tour : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg55c1u_dHk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg55c1u_dHk</a><br /><br />ü•á Milaidhoo <br />Finally, we have Milaidhoo as the winner of this top 5 resorts in the Maldives.
