{% raw %}#antimlm #itworkstopincomeearners<br />I love hearing Alli tell a story. She just has such a pure soul, and you can just see that her love runs deep. What she has already said is truly shocking, but what if I told you that we are JUST GETTING STARTED. It just gets worse(or better, however you want to look at it) from here.. Tune in tomorrow, as each episode just gets juicier and juicier!<br /><br />ALLI'S INSTAGRAM: www.instagram.com/_instag8r<br /><br />HAIR EXTENSIONS:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://liketk.it/3vDiu">https://liketk.it/3vDiu</a><br /><br />JOIN THE CHANNEL FOR SPECIAL PERKS!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiOp5s0qbquFOrKRpIpCwvA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiOp5s0qbquFOrKRpIpCwvA/join</a><br /><br />MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bonfire.com/store/the-jessica-hickson/">https://www.bonfire.com/store/the-jessica-hickson/</a><br />#HunbotRescueMission​​​​​<br /><br />LINKTREE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/thejessicahickson">https://linktr.ee/thejessicahickson</a><br /><br />SOME OF MY FAVORITE CREATORS:<br />@Hannah Alonzo <br />@You've Reached Melanie <br />@JulieJo <br />@Erin Bies <br />@I Dont Want No  Huns <br />@CC Suarez <br />@Deanna Mims <br /><br />Thank you guys so much for listening to my truth. You have truly taken away so much of the fear I had about speaking out about this. So many of these companies scare people into silence by making threats, but knowing that I have helped so many of you already, and continue to hear more stories every day, makes it all worth it.<br /><br />I make these videos for entertainment and educational purposes, but mainly to spread awareness so that other men and women don't fall victim to these tactics. I spent 5 years being miserably tricked into believing that I had the best life ever and that everyone would be LUCKY to have my life so I needed to share it with people as much as possible, when I was actually struggling with mental illness (among many other &quot;limiting beliefs&quot;) along side MANY of my peers who were in the MLM with me. <br /><br />Of course, as always, everything mentioned in these videos is based on my personal opinion and experience only. My opinions do not represent the company, anyone involved, or MLM's as a whole. They are not published as facts, though they are first hand experiences. <br /><br />Copyright Disclaimer under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education and research. Fair use is a use permitted by copyright statute that might otherwise be infringing. Non-profit, educational or personal use tips the balance in favor of fair use. <br /><br />Stay tuned for more anti-mlm content, and in the meantime, check out some of my other anti-mlm videos!<br /><br />THE PROBLEM WITH WEIGHTLOSS MLMS:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/S8flnVnpllo">https://youtu.be/S8flnVnpllo</a><br /><br />IT WORKS TOP EARNERS SCAMMED THE SYSTEM WITH PPP LOANS:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ywnQlFRONCM">https://youtu.be/ywnQlFRONCM</a><br /><br />IT WORKS SENT ME A PACKAGE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/CAomZXim3tI">https://youtu.be/CAomZXim3tI</a><br /><br />THIS HUN TRIED TO SCAM ME...:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Hrzps_jo674">https://youtu.be/Hrzps_jo674</a><br /><br />I FOUND SOME OF MY OLD MLM TRAINING NOTES:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Jg-k6wuD25Q">https://youtu.be/Jg-k6wuD25Q</a><br /><br />FORMER MLM TEAMMATES TELL ALL/EPISODE 1/MELANIE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ISj7IrMUju0">https://youtu.be/ISj7IrMUju0</a><br /><br />'IT WORKS' TOP 10 EARNER YELLING AT REPS:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/dRQLrsIwIY4">https://youtu.be/dRQLrsIwIY4</a><br /><br />IT WORKS TOP LEADER PROVES ALL OF MY POINTS:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/AXBf1cRG4kQ​">https://youtu.be/AXBf1cRG4kQ​</a><br /><br />SMALL BUSINESS SHOUTOUT <br />JKCE DESIGNS<br />WEBSITE:  www.JKCEDesigns.com<br /><br />MEMBER SHOUTOUT!! ---- L A U R I E  K O V A K!!!<br /><br />0:00 INTRO &amp; SHOUTOUTS<br />1:50 Video Begins<br />5:59 MEET MY BESTIE!!<br />15:18 lil bit culty<br />21:46 how she became famous<br />27:13 it gave us purpose<br />32:15 some real teaaaaa<br />38:28 the difference in experiences<br />46:21 preview of episode 2<br />47:07 OUTRO<br /><br />TikTok: TheJessicaHickson<br />Instagram: TheJessicaHickson<br /><br />SMALL BUSINESSES AND BUSINESS INQUIRIES:<br />120 W Washington St<br />PO Box 8185<br />Belleville, IL 62220<br />EMAIL: MyMLMHorrorStory@gmail.com<br />(to nominate a small business, email with subject line 'SMALL BUSINESS SHOUTOUT&quot; Please include all links you would like included so I don't have to go search for them! :) )<br /><br />PAINT COLOR: BEHR SPARKLING EMERALD<br />INTRO/OUTRO SONG: I'm Falling in Love - Wildflowers (ft.
