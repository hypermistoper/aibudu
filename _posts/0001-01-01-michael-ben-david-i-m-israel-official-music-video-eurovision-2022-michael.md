{% raw %}Michael Ben David will represent Israel at the Eurovision Song Contest 2022 in Turin with the song 'I.M'.<br /><br />Michael Ben David hails from Petah Tikva, a city in the Central District of Israel that lies just 10 kilometres east of Tel Aviv. Heâ€™s spoken quite openly on the show about the difficulties he faced as a child, from being bullied at school for singing in a high-pitched voice, to the trouble that his mother initially had accepting him when he came out as gay. <br /><br />Fittingly, his song I.M is a positive anthem about self-acceptance, and itâ€™s a message that was echoed once more by Michael when speaking with Israeli broadcaster KAN after his The X Factor Israel win: â€˜Iâ€™m a little shocked. People voted for me and that means they accept me for who I am. This isnâ€™t only for me. This is for so many people.â€™<br /><br />Read more about Michael Ben David: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://eurovision.tv/participant/michael-ben-david-22">https://eurovision.tv/participant/michael-ben-david-22</a><br /><br />Thanks to participating broadcaster IPBC/Kan.<br /><br />#Eurovision2022 #ESC2022 #Israel<br />-<br />The Eurovision Song Contest celebrates diversity through music.
