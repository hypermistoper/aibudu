{% raw %}Welcome to my little home on wheels! After traveling for years with only carry-on luggage, I have mastered the art of traveling light. In this video, I give you an inside look into my backpack, camera gear bag, toiletries and everything else I have found to be essential during my travels around the world! Contrary to popular belief, it is possible to live comfortably out of a carry-on suitcase for months at a time. You'll just need to make regular trip to the laundry mat. <br /><br />Check out my daily adventures on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lexielimitless/">https://www.instagram.com/lexielimitless/</a><br /><br />Sign up for my newsletter to get a preview of 3 CRAZY stories from my book: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lexielimitless.com/newsletter">https://www.lexielimitless.com/newsletter</a><br /><br />Check out my content creator courses on Lost Creator Academy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lostcreatoracademy.com/?aff=3696">https://lostcreatoracademy.com/?aff=3696</a><br /><br />HOW I MAKE MY VIDEOS ðŸŽ¥<br /><br />My Video Editor: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/itsmelionel/">https://www.instagram.com/itsmelionel/</a><br /><br />My Thumbnail Creator: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/parthcreations/">https://www.instagram.com/parthcreations/</a><br /><br />ðŸŽµ  Take your films to the next level with music from Musicbed.
