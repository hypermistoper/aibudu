{% raw %}&quot;What would Martha Stewart say?!&quot;<br /><br />From Bride of Chucky (1998): After being cut apart by the police, killer doll Chucky (Brad Dourif) is resurrected by Tiffany (Jennifer Tilly), an ex-girlfriend of the serial murderer whose soul is inside the toy. Following an argument, Chucky kills Tiffany and transfers her soul into a bride doll. To find the magical amulet that can restore them both to human form, Chucky and Tiffany arrange to be driven to New Jersey by Jesse (Nick Stabile) and Jade (Katherine Heigl), who are unaware that their cargo is alive.<br /><br />Watch the full movie: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/33GrNNm">https://bit.ly/33GrNNm</a><br /><br />Hi I’m Chucky! Wanna play? I like to play.<br /><br />Welcome to my official channel! I was once the notorious serial killer Charles Lee Ray until I was gunned down in a Chicago toy store, but before my dying breath I chanted the Damballa ritual and have been stuck as a doll ever since. Take a look back at my most memorable movie moments, from my multiple deaths and reincarnations to my killer one liners, as I desperately try (and often fail) to reclaim human form once again! <br /><br />I’ll be your friend to the end. <br /><br />HEEEERE’S CHUCKY. <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2KG6xhF">https://bit.ly/2KG6xhF</a><br /><br />#CHUCKY #ChildsPlay{% endraw %}
