{% raw %}Well, I've been grayed-out to start September off, but was startled when the Sun began flashing around 2:42 in. Also at 2:54 when I'm showing the repeat and side by side, there is an odd low tone. It reminded me of the sound effects from Jaws.  So, is this why we've been blanketed here this morning,, because 'they' needed to cover something up that was taking place around our latitude &amp; longitude? Who knows, but somethings up.<br /><br />8:41am &amp; 10:07am, Friday Sept. 1, 2017, NE Ohio, 49°F (9°C) - East and SE Skies<br /><br />~Jayling<br />-Nikon P900 with 83x optical zoom &amp; 166x dynamic fine digital zoom super telephoto Nikkor lens:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/compact-digital-cameras/coolpix-p900.html">http://www.nikonusa.com/en/nikon-products/product/compact-digital-cameras/coolpix-p900.html</a><br />-Homemade Solar Filter using Thousand Oaks Optical Solar Filter Film (inexpensive from Amazon), some cardboard and tape.{% endraw %}
