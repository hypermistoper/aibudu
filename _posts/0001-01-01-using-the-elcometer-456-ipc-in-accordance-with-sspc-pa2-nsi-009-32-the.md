{% raw %}The Elcometer 456 Industrial Protective Coating Thickness Gauge is a fast and easy to use DFT gauge designed to measure dry film thickness on shot or grit blasted steel substrates.<br /><br />Pre-calibrated with 4 profile ranges to ensure accurate coating thickness measurement on blasted substrates, the Elcometer 456 IPC Thickness Gauge can take over 70 readings per minute - significantly reducing inspection times.<br /><br />A recent study by the National Shipbuilding Research Program researched the use of digital inspection tools in accordance with 009-32. The NSRP found that by using a pre-calibrated Elcometer 456 they were able to measure dry film thickness in half the time of of their current DFT measurement methods.<br /><br />Coating thickness readings can be transferred via Bluetooth® or USB to ElcoMaster®, or your own software application, for instant report generation.<br /><br />For more information on the Elcometer 456 IPC Gauge, please contact Elcometer at sales@elcometer.com, or visit our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.elcometer.com/en/coating-inspection/dry-film-thickness/dry-film-thickness-digital/elcometer-456-ipc-dry-film-thickness-gauge.html">http://www.elcometer.com/en/coating-inspection/dry-film-thickness/dry-film-thickness-digital/elcometer-456-ipc-dry-film-thickness-gauge.html</a><br /><br />To view the full NSRP report on Reducing Inspection Costs Using the Latest Digital Inspection Tools, visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.elcometer.com/nsrp-report">http://www.elcometer.com/nsrp-report</a><br /><br />-----<br /><br />Click here to download the video script in English: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.elcometer.com/pub/media/PDF/Video_Scripts/456_IPC_PA2_009-32_Script.pdf">https://www.elcometer.com/pub/media/PDF/Video_Scripts/456_IPC_PA2_009-32_Script.pdf</a><br /><br />-----<br /><br />STANDARDS:<br /><br />ASTM D7091, ISO 2808, ISO 19840, SSPC PA-2, US Navy NSI 009-32{% endraw %}
