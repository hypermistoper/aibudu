{% raw %}GT 7 is out imminently, coming to both PS5 and PS4, and it's promising to deliver a Gran Turismo experience that's much more in line with fans' expectations, and not only builds on and includes a vast array of ideas from past games, but is also bringing some new and interesting ones of its own as well. <br /><br />And for all of these reasons and more, the upcoming racer has the potential to be one of 2022's standout hits- which is saying quite a lot, given how packed this year is going to be.{% endraw %}
