{% raw %}My designing process is one of feeling my way with many corrections and a lot of editing - shifting whole areas of the work around and constantly changing and adapting the design. I am using simple pencil and paper followed by Polydraw 0.50 tracing filme. Then I use a good quality carbon paper to transfer the drawign to my traditional artist lino. The scene is Wastwater in the Lake District UK.{% endraw %}
