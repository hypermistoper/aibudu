{% raw %}Need help buying your next car? Click the following link and my team and I will help you choose your ideal car at a fair price - from Mat Watson! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/-Help-Me-carwow">http://bit.ly/-Help-Me-carwow</a><br />.............................................................<br /><br />What happens when you take a classic Range Rover, rebuild the entire engine, and add a load of updates both inside &amp; out? Well, you get this - the Kingsley Cars ULEZ Reborn Range Rover Classic! <br /><br />The name's a bit of a mouthful, right? But don’t let that turn you off! This is one classic car that you’ll definitely want to check out. <br /><br />For starters, let’s check out the engine. The car was originally released in 1981, but the engines had a full rebuild, meaning the 4.6-litre V8 now puts down 270hp &amp; 416Nm of torque! <br /><br />Think that’s impressive? Well, there are a number of interior updates which are equally as cool. While it retains some original features, such as classic dials and clocks, you get a number of mod-cons, including a built-in sat-nav &amp; a wireless charging pad! <br /><br />There’s one rather big issue though… The starting price is £125,000, and the model we have here costs £170,000!! So, is it worth it? You’ll have to keep watching to find out!<br /><br />Chapters<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:36 Tax<br />01:21 Design<br />02:40 Brakes &amp; Brake Test<br />03:53 Interior<br />05:28 Back Seats<br />07:00 Boot<br />08:31 5 Annoying Things<br />10:06 5 Cool Things<br />11:26 Driving<br />14:30 0-60mph<br />15:18 Verdict<br /><br />.............................................................<br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/carwow">http://www.instagram.com/carwow</a><br /><br />Tiktok - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow">https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow</a><br /><br />Facebook – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk">http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Twitter – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk">http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Sign Up to our Newsletter – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter">http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter</a><br /><br />Awkward haggling is a thing of the past with carwow.
