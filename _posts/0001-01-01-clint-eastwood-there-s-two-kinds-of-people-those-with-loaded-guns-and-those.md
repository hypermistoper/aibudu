{% raw %}Quote: You see, in this world there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig. You dig. <br />Actor: Clint Eastwood<br />Movie/Show: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly<br /><br />I do NOT own these clips. They are property of their respective studio. Studios, instead of flagging a 3-6 second clip, just message me if you want it taken down. But keep in mind that 3-6 seconds DOES get people wanting to see your movie/TV show.<br /><br />&quot;Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
