{% raw %}Hello friends,<br />Given what is happening in Ukraine it didn't feel appropriate to upload my regular type of video.<br /><br />Like so many of you I am horrified at what is happening.  I have so much admiration for the people of Ukraine who are literally fighting for their families, their country and their lives.  Also for the citizens of Russia who are risking their lives to protest in the streets against what their government is doing.  <br /><br />To the citizens of Ukraine, you are what courage looks like.  You are showing the world by your actions what it means to love your neighbour and your country and your freedom more than your own safety.  <br /><br />To my viewers in Ukraine, who I consider friends, I hope are safe. I love you.  We love you.<br /><br />To the rest of us I say: In a world where you can be anything, please choose to be kind.<br /><br />I love you,<br />Adelina{% endraw %}
