{% raw %}Almost 30 years ago, President Spencer W. Kimball opened the April 1979 General Conference with his address entitled, Fortify Your Homes Against Evil. I would highly recommend reading it. His warnings about the evil influences that surround us today are more important for us to heed NOW than it was for the Saints back in the 70's which was the &quot;Brady Bunch&quot; and &quot;Leave it to Beaver&quot; Days. I want you to know, that I did not stumble upon this talk by accident, without going into the details, I feel that I divinely guided and thus I felt inspired to create this following video. We live in a world that has made evil look good and good look evil. Television plays a huge role in this. It is my hope the you will watch this video with your families, especially if you have children. Hopefully many of you have seen some of my other youtube videos, if not, I would be honored if you would spend a couple of minutes and watch some of them at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/davidkat99.">http://www.youtube.com/davidkat99.</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Thanks and I would love to hear your comments.<br /><br />David{% endraw %}
