{% raw %}üçøWATCH NEXT: ASWAN NILE RIVER CRUISE ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/8bl3wPRuzP0">https://youtu.be/8bl3wPRuzP0</a><br />üîî PLEASE SUBSCRIBE, for more travel vlogs ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/you-da-best‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã">https://bit.ly/you-da-best‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã</a><br />üëï 15% OFF CUTS Clothing ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cuts.team/traveldeeper">https://cuts.team/traveldeeper</a><br /><br />Edfu Temple: Cruising up the Nile River from Aswan, we make one final, early morning stop before we‚Äôre scheduled to reach Luxor this afternoon. This is the Temple of Edfu. One of the best preserved shrines in all of Egypt. <br /><br />So many stories and pharaohs and gods, it‚Äôll make your head spin, but the biggest thing to remember is that this place is primarily dedicated to the Egyptian God Horus and Egyptian Goddess Hathor; two of the most significant deities of Ancient Egypt.<br /><br />Over the centuries, the temple was forgotten and became buried under almost 40 feet of sand and silt from the Nile, and locals even built their homes over the submerged temple grounds.How this place could have ever been taken fore-granted, blows my mind.<br /><br />Nile River Cruise: Back onboard, we continue upstream and pass through the river‚Äôs lock system. Which apparently is the perfect place to do your souvenir shopping. Once we‚Äôre in the clear, it‚Äôs smooth sailing the rest of the way up to Luxor.<br /><br />Karnak Temples: As our cruise ship docks along the Nile in Luxor, we end our time on the water and immediately set out to discover why people characterize this city as the ‚Äúworld‚Äôs greatest open-air museum.‚Äù<br /><br />Karnak Temple or simple Karnak is said to be the second most visited site in Egypt behind the Pyramids in Giza. The key difference between Karnak and most of the other temples and sites in Egypt is the length of time it was developed and used. <br /><br />30 different pharaohs contributed to the buildings, enabling it to reach such a size, complexity, and diversity not seen elsewhere.<br /><br />And then right down the Spinx Avenue from Karnak is the world famous Luxor Temple.<br /><br />Luxor Temple: Unlike the other temples, Luxor Temple is not dedicated to a specific god or pharaoh in death, instead, it is dedicated to the rejuvenation of kingship - basically an important place where kings were crowned. Alexander the Great even claims he was crowned here.<br /><br />Kids, skip school and come to Luxor. it‚Äôs a history book in real-life.<br /><br />Habu Temple: Last but certainly not least, my personal favorite of three‚Ä¶ Habu Temple<br /><br />Back across the river, on the West Bank of the Nile rests the grounds of Medinet Habu or the city of Habu. An expansive complex that was built by Ramses III and dedicated to the Egyptian God, Amun; and this place has so many incredible features.<br /><br />Truthfully, we could go on and on about the fascinating aspects of this place, from it‚Äôs abnormally deep carvings to the ceremonies performed here, but at the risk of overwhelming you with temple footage, we press on. <br /><br />Valley of Kings: Long story short, Many Egyptian Kings and powerful nobles of the New Kingdom had the same big dream; to be buried at the Pyramids of Giza; as the pyramids are 2,000 years older than this site. When that wasn‚Äôt possible, they found the next best thing, to be buried here, under the rocks shaped like a pyramid on the West bank of the Nile For the next 500 years or so, that‚Äôs exactly what they did.<br /><br />Luxor, Egypt Nightlife: After a full-on day dedicated to the ditties and death, we were in much need of some modern life, so for our last night in Luxor, we decide to just hit the streets on our own, and see what we can get into‚Ä¶<br /><br />I hope you enjoyed this Egypt Travel Vlog from Luxor, Egypt as much as we did making it!  ‚ù§Ô∏è If so, please hit that &quot;üëç&quot; button, and leave a comment!<br /><br />See ya next week!<br /><br />----------<br /><br />WATCH ANOTHER &quot;TRAVEL DEEPER&quot; SERIES: ‚úàÔ∏è<br />Russia ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Travel-Deeper-Russia-S...">https://bit.ly/Travel-Deeper-Russia-S...</a><br />Philippines ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Travel-Deeper-Philippi...">https://bit.ly/Travel-Deeper-Philippi...</a><br />Japan ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Travel-Deeper-Japan-Se...">https://bit.ly/Travel-Deeper-Japan-Se...</a><br />Brazil ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Travel-Deeper-Brazil-S...">https://bit.ly/Travel-Deeper-Brazil-S...</a><br />Australia ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Travel-Deeper-Australi...">https://bit.ly/Travel-Deeper-Australi...</a><br />USA ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Travel-Deeper-USA-Series">https://bit.ly/Travel-Deeper-USA-Series</a><br />Mexico ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Travel-Deeper-Mexico-S...">https://bit.ly/Travel-Deeper-Mexico-S...</a><br /><br />----------<br /><br />WHO AM I?<br /><br />Hi!
