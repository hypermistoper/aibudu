{% raw %}How does it feel to have the world's most powerful rocket in operation hibernating in<br />your storage facilities for three good years? SpaceX can tell you, as its mighty Falcon<br />Heavy rocket has been chilling for years at a time now! However, the story is about to<br />change, as the beastly launch rocket is about to roar to life again! Come June 2022,<br />SpaceX will fire up the Super Heavy again as it will be launching to orbit! What payload<br />is the rocket launching, who is the client, and what is Elon Musk's SpaceX doing to<br />ensure the launch goes as smoothly as possible?<br />The last flight of SpaceX's Super Heavy occurred in June 2019, making it exactly three<br />years since the powerful rocket went to space. The rocket's maiden flight took place on<br />February 6th, 2018, when it lifted off from NASA's historic Kennedy Space Center (KSC)<br />Pad 39A launch complex.{% endraw %}
