{% raw %}Sizeable is a puzzle/exploration game about shrinking and growing the environment in order to find all the hidden objects that every little diorama hides! This is a review of the Sizeable demo currently available on Steam that is due for release March 19 2021. I think I came across this game maybe 6-8 months ago and somehow life has been so busy that I didn't get around to playing and reviewing it until now. It is a fun little immersive experience that encourages curiosity as you explore how size impacts these diorama worlds.<br /><br />SIZEABLE<br />Steam: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1333910/Sizeable/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1333910/Sizeable/</a><br />Itch.io: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sarrus.itch.io/sizeable">https://sarrus.itch.io/sizeable</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Video-Game/Sizeable-Game-107655427556713/">https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Video-Game/Sizeable-Game-107655427556713/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AmbroosSander">https://twitter.com/AmbroosSander</a><br /><br />Want to talk more?
