{% raw %}The first cars to benefit from V2I technology will be the 2017 Audi Q7, A4, and A4 Allroad, all available this fall. Evidently, do not expect this to work everywhere, but certain cities in the U.S.A. have been converted to “smart cities,” and they feature the V2I systems on its traffic lights.<br /><br />If you like DPCcars videos please subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/BSIaFc">https://goo.gl/BSIaFc</a>{% endraw %}
