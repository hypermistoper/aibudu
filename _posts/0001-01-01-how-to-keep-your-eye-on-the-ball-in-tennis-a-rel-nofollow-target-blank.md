{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.feeltennis.net/still-head-at-contact/">http://www.feeltennis.net/still-head-at-contact/</a><br /><br />Watching the ball or keeping your head still at contact is one of the most common coaching advice in tennis and yet almost no recreational tennis players are able to do it.<br /><br />I believe that one needs to first remove the obstacles to keeping your head still and only then can this skill be acquired.<br /><br />I know of 3 mental blocks and one physical. <br /><br />You may look up before contact because you want to see where your opponent is going.<br /><br />You may also look up because you want to see where the target is.<br /><br />You may also look up because the rotation of your body is pulling your head up.<br /><br />And of course, you may not trust your ability to hit targets without looking at them so again you want to look up to be sure.<br /><br />Unless you deal with these obstacles, you won't be able to keep your eye on the ball and maintain a still head while hitting the ball.{% endraw %}
