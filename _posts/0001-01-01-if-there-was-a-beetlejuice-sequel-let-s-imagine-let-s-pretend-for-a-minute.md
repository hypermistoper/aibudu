{% raw %}LET'S PRETEND for a minute. Let's exemplify how cool a sequel to Tim Burton's 1988 ghost-saturated horror-comedy Beetlejuice could be. Beetlejuice is so iconic and talks of a sequel have been going on since the release of the original, so what gives?? Seeing this whimsically gothic world in a modern setting using contemporary technology would be beyond interesting.<br /><br />So what do you say to the return of Michael Keaton, Winona Ryder, Geena Davis, Alec Baldwin, and Catherine O'Hara?<br /><br />Let's manifest it. BEETLEJUICE! BEETLEJUICE! BEETLEJUICE!<br /><br />Hope you all have a scary-ass Halloween season.<br /><br />#beetlejuice #timburton #trailer{% endraw %}
