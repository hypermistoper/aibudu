{% raw %}Hello Friends, today is another video featuring 'Apali Root Crop ', Kumusta Po? I hope you are doing good today.<br /><br />Apali -Â grows in rainfed or upland and marginal lands and can be grown as a backup crop during growing seasons of rice and corn. Depending on the variety, Apali plant can grow up to 50 cm long and can produce 5-20 tubers per plant. The stems are cylindrical, pubescent, with scattered prickles. The texture looks like a taro root and taste like sweet potato.<br /><br /><br /><br />Credit to Lucky Soriano Rivera for the relaxing background music.<br /><br />visit his channel here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/channel/UCFsYK-66GFm-DxIbp8YfDug">https://youtube.com/channel/UCFsYK-66GFm-DxIbp8YfDug</a>{% endraw %}
