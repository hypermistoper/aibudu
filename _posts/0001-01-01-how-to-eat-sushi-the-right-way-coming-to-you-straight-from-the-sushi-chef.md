{% raw %}Coming to you straight from the sushi chef's mouth, MUNCHIES presents the dos and don'ts of eating sushi, as taught by Tokyo's Naomichi Yasuda. Be warned: You've been doing it wrong. Just remember: It's okay to use your fingers to eat cut sushi rolls. Don't combine ginger and sushi, or ginger and soy sauce. Ginger is a palate cleanser in between bites. When dipping sushi into soy sauce, dip fish-side down. Never shake soy sauce off of sushi. That's like shaking your wanker in public.<br /><br /> Click here to SUBSCRIBE to VICE Asia: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2LhqAR9">https://bit.ly/2LhqAR9</a>{% endraw %}
