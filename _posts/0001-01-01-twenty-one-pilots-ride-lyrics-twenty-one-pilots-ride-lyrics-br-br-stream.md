Who would you die for?<br />And would you ever kill?<br />[Chorus]<br />Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'<br />So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'<br />So I'm takin' my time on my ride<br />Takin' my time on my ride<br /><br />[Bridge]<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br />Help me<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br />Help me<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'<br />So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'<br />So I'm takin' my time<br />Takin' my time on my ride, woah-oh-oh (Wuh, yeah)<br />Oh-woah-woah, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'<br />So I'm takin' my time on my ride, oh-woah-woah, I'm fallin'<br />So I'm takin' my time on my<br />[Outro]<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br />Help me<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br />Help me<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br />Help me<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br />I've been thinkin' too much<br />Help me{% endraw %}
