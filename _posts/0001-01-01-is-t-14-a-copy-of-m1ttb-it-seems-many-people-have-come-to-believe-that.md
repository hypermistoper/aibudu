{% raw %}It seems many people have come to believe that T-14 came as an inspiration from the American M1 Tank Test Bed, some outright even sayings that its a direct copy. But that is far from the truth. In this video we will take a quick peak at some of the projects that led up to T-14 and we will see how does M1 TTB connect to all of that, if it even does in the first place.<br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/RedEffect">https://www.patreon.com/RedEffect</a><br /><br />Sources:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.benning.army.mil/armor/eARMOR/content/issues/1995/MAR_APR/ArmorMarchApril1995web.pdf">https://www.benning.army.mil/armor/eARMOR/content/issues/1995/MAR_APR/ArmorMarchApril1995web.pdf</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://btvt.info/2futureprojects/object299.htm">http://btvt.info/2futureprojects/object299.htm</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://btvt.info/2futureprojects/t-95.htm">http://btvt.info/2futureprojects/t-95.htm</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://btvt.info/2futureprojects/450/450.htm">http://btvt.info/2futureprojects/450/450.htm</a>{% endraw %}
