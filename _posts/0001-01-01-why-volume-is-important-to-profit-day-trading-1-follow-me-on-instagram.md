My edge is my strategy and is what I make the most amount of money on. I sit on my hands and WAIT until that comes along. I pass on all other opportunities despite how tempting and good they may look. <br />If I don't see an opportunity, I simply don't trade it. This week so far lacked HIGH QUALITY setups due to a lack of volatility in the market. I'm OKAY with that as I know when its proper to be active vs sitting sidelined. I know other YouTubers / traders on Twitter make it seem like they are flawless and they win all their trades without any struggle. Slow periods are part of the game. Accept them and GROW from them!<br /><br />Hope you all enjoy ! :)<br /><br />If you have any suggestions for future videos such as Day Trading, Investing, Stock Market, Option Trading, Real Estate, Robinhood, TD Ameritrade, ThinkorSwim, Crypto &amp; bitcoin, Entrepreneurship, Forex, or fun daily vlogs.
