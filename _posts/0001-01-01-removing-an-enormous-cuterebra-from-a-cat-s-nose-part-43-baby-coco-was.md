{% raw %}Baby COCO was not doing too well &amp; what we originally thought was an upper respiratory infection, was actually something pretty gross. A huge cuterebra larvae (bot fly) was living up inside her nose. Thankfully the vet was able to remove it fairly quickly. Poor baby ! Shout out to Holly Animal Hospital for fitting us in &amp; making this little girl feel so much better. (And the vet staff was pretty happy to get this yucky parasite out of her nose as you'll find out if you turn up your volume).<br /><br />See more from Street Cat's Rescue here, and more awesome removals:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/StreetCatsRescue">https://www.facebook.com/StreetCatsRescue</a> <br /><br />Note: All Videos Here On This Channel Have Been Allowed To Be Uploaded On It(except Commentary, it's Original And Added By Me With My Own Voice)<br /><br />Love Animals?
