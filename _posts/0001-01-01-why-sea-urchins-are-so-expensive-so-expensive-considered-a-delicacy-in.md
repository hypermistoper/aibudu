{% raw %}Considered a delicacy in several parts of the world, sea urchin, or uni in Japanese, is prized for its unique flavor.

Sea urchins are one of the few seafoods still hand-harvested by divers today. In recent years, masses of them have taken over the seabeds of California. So why are there so many urchins?
