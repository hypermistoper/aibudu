When dough has combined into a shaggy ball, begin to squeeze and pinch the dough with a very wet hand. When the dough forms a less shaggy, more cohesive ball, add salt to top of dough. Cover dough. <br /><br />In a separate container add yeast and 30g or 1/4c of the 86F/30C water and stir to combine. Allow both the dough and yeast mixture to sit for 15-20min. Add yeast mixture into the salted dough. Mix with a soaking wet hand by pinching and turning. Once yeast and salt are fully incorporated, cover and allow to rise at room temperature for 30 minutes. <br /><br />Perform a strength building fold as shown @2:29. Cover and allow to sit at room temp for 30 more minutes. Perform a second strength building fold - see @2:59. Cover and allow to ferment at room temp for another 90 minutes. <br /><br />Place a piece of well oiled parchment on an upside down sheet tray. <br /><br />Flour work surface and dough and flip dough onto work surface. Divide dough into two equal pieces (300g each). Degas and preshape dough balls as shown @3:50.  Cover and allow to relax for 15-20min. <br /><br />Shape dough balls into baguettes as shown @4:22.  Place shaped baguettes onto oiled parchment, cover and allow to proof at room temp for 60-90 minutes. I‚Äôm using the foil pan linked here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3JLY3l4">https://amzn.to/3JLY3l4</a> . After proofing, the baguettes should have risen by about 50-60%. <br /><br />Spray well with water, then score the top of the baguettes, cover again with foil pan, and bake in a preheated 450F/230C oven for 30-35min, carefully removing the cover after 15 minutes of bake time.  <br /><br /><br />*for reference, the ‚Äúroom temp‚Äù of my house at the time of filming this video was 69-70F/20-21C. <br /><br /><br />------<br />IF USING A STAND MIXER: <br />Mix flour and water in a stand mixer on med low for 4-5 minutes or until dough forms a shaggy ball.
