{% raw %}Our modern, science-based society considers it healthy to doubt our preconceptions and adjust our beliefs based on evidence.  Sure, not everybody does this well, but the ideal itself is considered a positive.  This puts Christianity in a pinch.  On one hand, most Christians are determined from the start to keep believing in their religion and consider straying from the faith a moral failure.  But on the other hand, they want to consider themselves as evidence-based and open to doubt as the rest of society.  So how do they do this?  Today I will review an animated video by Impact 360 that makes a pretty standard attempt at paying lip service to asking questions while ensuring those questions lead to a specific answer.<br /><br />NOTES<br />- ABOUT THE DEFINITION OF DOUBT:  I start by saying it seems suspicious that the video starts by asking &quot;What is doubt?&quot; when the word seems to have a pretty obvious definition in the context.  However, I later explain different things that doubt can mean.  Why is this?  First, I don't really explain fundamentally different definitions of doubt as much as varying degrees of doubt.  The core concept is still the same.  Doubt is having a level of uncertainty about whether something is true, and I just explained varying levels of doubt without questioning what the basic meaning of the word is.  Second, we had completely opposite purposes for raising questions about the word.  Impact 360 tried to hide behind any ambiguity in its meaning (even burying its vague &quot;definition&quot; in a larger thought process), while my point was to be more clear about what we mean when we use the word and to take Impact 360 to task for its obfuscation.<br />- ABOUT MY DISMISSAL OF THE PEOPLE THE VIDEO QUOTES:  In brushing off the quotes presented in this video, I mention 1) how long ago those people lived and died and 2) one of their religious backgrounds.  This does not mean I automatically dismiss what people say because of they're religious or lived a long time ago.  However, if someone's most current citations are from people who lived in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they're clearly not up on the freshest information in their field and are likely cherry-picking - and it IS fair to suspect that someone's devout religious belief has something to do with why they say the Bible is reliable.  Part of the issue is the quality/nature of the quotes.  If these people presented tangible, evidence-based findings they came up with working within their field, it would be inappropriate to dismiss them because they were religious and/or from an earlier time.  However, when they make sweeping statements of personal opinion, then it's totally appropriate to wonder what factors other than the selectively displayed credentials might have fed in to that opinion.<br /><br />Original video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvDS3k9NXgo&amp;t=1s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvDS3k9NXgo&amp;t=1s</a><br /><br />STUFF ABOUT ME AND WHERE TO FIND ME<br /><br />My Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/prophetofzod">https://www.patreon.com/prophetofzod</a><br />My Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Prophet-of-Zod">https://www.facebook.com/Prophet-of-Zod</a><br />My Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Prophet_of_Zod">https://twitter.com/Prophet_of_Zod</a><br />My Email: poz@prophetofzod.com<br /><br />My mailing address:<br />PO Box 773024<br />Eagle River, AK 99577<br /><br />Website: www.prophetofzod.com (Still under construction, but you can find a little merch and an incomplete set of links to my back library){% endraw %}
