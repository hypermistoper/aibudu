{% raw %}*** A Bonus Video***<br /><br />As requested, Simon has a go at Inception by Matyas Martinka, surely one of the most incredible constructions in puzzle history.  You solve the first grid as a Hitori, then an Akari, then a Nurikabe, then a Killer Sudoku and then a Star Battle.  And every single puzzle is good!!  You can play it at the link below: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/inceptionpuzzle">https://tinyurl.com/inceptionpuzzle</a><br /><br />Rules: <br />All rules are standard and the individual puzzles are meant to be solvable even if you've never tried the given variant.<br /><br />- Shade the grid by standard Hitori rules using the pencil marks as clues.<br />- Use the shaded cells' pencil marks as clues to shade the grid by standard Akari rules. If a shaded cell contains a pencil mark greater than 4, it acts as a 0 for Akari.<br />- If a cell contains a light bulb and it's corner mark is not 8 or 9, its pencil mark can be placed in the grid as part of the solution.<br />- Shade the grid by standard Nurikabe rules using the placed numbers as clues. (The pencil marks on shaded &quot;water&quot; Nurikabe cells are no longer needed.)<br />- Solve the grid as a standard Killer Sudoku where the cages are the Nurikabe islands, and the sum of the digits in the cage equals to the sum of the corner pencil marks in that cage. (The previously placed numbers remain in the grid.)<br />- In the solved Killer Sudoku, place 2 stars in every row, column and 3 by 3 region according to standard Star Battle rules. Cells with 4 or 5 must not contain stars.<br /><br />Please note there is a full explanation of the rules at the link below:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=000912">https://logic-masters.de/Raetselportal/Raetsel/zeigen.php?id=000912</a><br /><br />Our PO Box address:<br /><br />Simon Anthony &amp; Mark Goodliffe <br />Box 102<br />56 Gloucester Road <br />London<br />SW7 4UB<br /><br />(Please note to use our real names rather than 'Cracking The Cryptic'.)<br /><br />*** New Patreon Content ***<br /><br />To all our patrons - thank you so much for your support.  <br />We've just released The QAS (&quot;Quite Approachable Sudoku&quot;) Hunt and Simon's solve of Phistomefel's Sequence Sudoku.<br /><br />Also new on Patreon are:<br /><br /> - Solution videos for last month's Star Wars Sudoku Hunt by Peter C Hayward.<br />- Mark's solve of Phistomefel's Sequence Sudoku.  <br />- Simon's solve of Fillomino Aquarium - the new beast of a puzzle by Phistomefel.<br /> - Mark's latest solve of The Times Club Monthly Special crossword.<br />- the complete suite of solution videos (all 45 of them!!) to the Pyramid Puzzle Hunt.<br /><br />You can join us on Patreon for as little as $2/month here:  <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/crackingthecryptic">https://www.patreon.com/crackingthecryptic</a><br /><br />▶ SUDOKU PAD - Our New App  ◀<br /><br />It's OUT on Windows (released yesterday!) via Steam here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1706870/Svens_SudokuPad/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/1706870/Svens_SudokuPad/</a><br /><br />You can now input your own classic sudoku puzzles into our software using our new App!
