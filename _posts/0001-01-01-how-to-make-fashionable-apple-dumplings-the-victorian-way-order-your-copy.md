In actual fact, sheâ€™s hard at work; these dishcloths help to produce a rather interesting texture to todayâ€™s recipe - Fashionable Apple Dumplings.<br /><br />English Heritage is a charity, working to preserve the story of England and bring it to life.<br />Enjoying the series?

This can be made with 225g flour, 85g suet, a generous pinch of salt and some cold water. Gradually mix the ingredients in a bowl until you have a smooth, elastic dough.<br /><br />Next, peel and core the apples. Place a few spoonfuls of your favourite marmalade into the hole in the middle of each apple.<br /><br />Roll out your suet crust dough until itâ€™s thin, then place an apple in the middle and wrap the pastry entirely around it. Cut off any excess, and make sure the suet crust completely seals around the apple until itâ€™s smooth all over. Wrap the apple in a dishcloth that has been coated with melted butter, and tie the top with string to ensure that itâ€™s tightly wrapped. Repeat this process for each apple.<br /><br />To cook, place the apple parcels into a pan of already boiling water (otherwise the apples will disintegrate). Keep it at a simmer for just under an hour depending on the size of the apples. Once cooked, removed the apple parcels from the pan and carefully remove the cloth. Serve on their own or with cream.<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO OUR YOUTUBE CHANNEL: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/c5lVBJ">https://goo.gl/c5lVBJ</a> <br />FIND A PLACE TO VISIT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/86w2F6">https://goo.gl/86w2F6</a> <br />LIKE US ON FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/Un5F2X">https://goo.gl/Un5F2X</a> <br />FOLLOW US ON TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/p1EoGh">https://goo.gl/p1EoGh</a> <br />FOLLOW US ON INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/PFzmY5">https://goo.gl/PFzmY5</a>{% endraw %}
