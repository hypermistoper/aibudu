{% raw %}Time traveler, stock your backpack with your favorite hygiene essentials because we’re living in the best time ever for cleanliness! Don’t forget your toothpaste! Some ancient civilizations used a mixture of gum Arabic and soot to keep their teeth clean. That, or a mix of the salt, mint, iris flower, and pepper. One dentist tried this combo to see how it works. Let’s just say, didn’t feel good on the gums! <br /><br />About 5,000 years ago, people in Egypt and Greece would fray a small twig to clean in between their teeth. A few centuries later, soap appeared! It was a mix of boiled fat and ash. In such hot climates, people would wash their bodies up to 4 times a day, using soda ash to get rid of dirt. And Romans are better known for their public restrooms. To make “clean-up” easier, the Romans would fix a sponge at the end of a stick. By the way, they'd share that thing amongst themselves! Let's find out more about what hygiene was like in the past. How did the ancients clean themselves?<br /><br />#brightside<br /><br />CC BY-SA 4.0 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0:">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0:</a><br />Castellum Divisorium in Nîmes, Gard, France: By Krzysztof Golik, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=77115518">https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=77115518</a><br />Buanderie artisanale en Sologne au début du 20e siècle: By Unknown author, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=89892461">https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=89892461</a><br />CC BY 3.0 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0:">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0:</a><br />A replica xylospongium (sponge on a stick): By D.
