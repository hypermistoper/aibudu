{% raw %}Worry is like telling our omnipotent God the unthinkable: “I don’t trust You.” Yet worry is still a struggle for many who have experienced God’s goodness—even mature believers. Reflecting on Jesus’ words about anxiety, Alistair Begg explains that we can think rightly about our troubles when we view them in light of God’s Word. Only then will we trust our burdens to the One who can truly bear them.<br /><br />Scripture: Luke 12:22<br />Preached: November 12, 2000<br /><br />Find more sermons by Alistair Begg at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.truthforlife.org/resources/most-recent-sermons/">https://www.truthforlife.org/resources/most-recent-sermons/</a>{% endraw %}
