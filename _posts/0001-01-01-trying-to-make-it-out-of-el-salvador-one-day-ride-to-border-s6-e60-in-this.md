{% raw %}In this episode I am leaving the capital San Salvador, after having my Honda CRF300L Rally serviced. I ride towards the Santa Ana volcano, and after a good day of riding dirt trails, I reach a small town called Apaneca. I didn't come here without any reason.. I am meeting an absolute motorcycle legend here!! <br /><br />Gear &amp; Equipment that I use in this season: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.itchyboots.com/blog/gear-and-equipment-season-6-alaska">https://www.itchyboots.com/blog/gear-and-equipment-season-6-alaska</a><br /><br />Follow my journey on: WWW.ITCHYBOOTS.COM<br />Instagram:   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/itchybootstravel">https://www.instagram.com/itchybootstravel</a><br />Facebook:     <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/itchyboots">https://www.facebook.com/itchyboots</a><br /><br /><br />#itchyboots #adventure #crf300rally{% endraw %}
