Although we aren't getting new Mario World Records every week, it's still crazy the improvements the Mario 64 speedrunning community is making. 1 hour 37 minutes and 50 seconds. Will Emiru beat Mizkif in Super Mario 64? SM64 Speedrunning as gone far, but will people like Batora, Liam, or puncayshun get the SM64 120 Star Record? Simply Super Mario 64 120 Star World Record did in fact happen. Simply mario WR is coming. Super Mario 64 120 Star World Record reactions are my favorite, although we can't forget about 16 star mario 64 and 70 star mario 64 world record.<br /><br />#mario #speedrun #sm64{% endraw %}
