{% raw %}LIN GONG-Literally &quot;fortify the body&quot; or &quot;train the power&quot;, the term is more completely defined as foundation training, or weaponizing the body.  It is this training that enables the techniques to be used to their fullest potential, and most accurately fits the description of &quot;kung fu&quot; (acquired skill), while techniques (san sik/kuen faat) are rightly that acquired skill in application.  <br /><br />Hung Ga training relies heavily on foundation training, specifically the training of the stance, bridge and body connection for generation and transmission of power.  Our complexity lies not with our techniques, but with the increasing detail of the internal physiological connections we can make to create immense power for our techniques, as well as great variety of the quality of the power, whether hard, soft, sensing, circular, etc.<br /><br />Obtaining the Hung Ga foundation is very difficult, as such not many people have the strength of will to complete it.  It is because of this that Hung Ga is not an easy style to learn and make good, but for those that are able to endure the outcomes are great and rewarding.{% endraw %}
