Ukraine mined approaches to the coast of Odessa<br /><br />Earlier information that the Ukrainian military could lay mines in the coastal areas of the Black Sea received the first confirmation. As it became known, the information that the coastal zone near Odessa was mined with sea mines is true. Moreover, we are also talking about mining beaches.<br />Information in this regard was confirmed this afternoon after the publication of a video in which you can see a demonstration of the explosion of one of the mines on the beach in Odessa. This, apparently, is about a mine installed on the beach itself or thrown ashore.<br />Previously, there were reports that the Ukrainian military had planted &quot;many&quot; sea mines in the coastal zone, although due to the virtual absence of warships in Ukraine, this was considered unreliable. However, given the fact that the coast is mined, this creates dangerous prerequisites.<br /><br />How many sea mines are in service with the Ukrainian Navy is unknown, however, earlier the Ukrainian military made provocative statements about their readiness to mine certain areas of the Sea of Azov, noting that this is the cheapest means compared to warships and coastal missile systems.<br /><br /><br />IMPORTANT!<br />None of these images, music &amp; video clips were created/owned by us.<br />This video is purely fan-made, if you (owners) have seen your content and want to remove this video, please message us privately or mail us : (newtropicalhouse@gmail.com) before doing anything.
