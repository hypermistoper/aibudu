Jesse wonders whether this has anything to do with Donald Trump’s obsession with water pressure and his claim that people must flush their toilets 10-15 times to get them to flush. Additionally, Jesse talks about the latest developments related to the National Archives and Records Administration asking the Department of Justice to open a probe into Donald Trump’s illegal handling of documents and classified materials. <br /><br />CLICK THE JOIN BUTTON and partner with me and support my work by becoming a Channel Member: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUSySH2YjIwsDu2Hx6DWwTA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUSySH2YjIwsDu2Hx6DWwTA/join</a><br /><br />- Subscribe to the YouTube Channel<br />- Subscribe to my twice-weekly (TOTALLY different than the YouTube videos) Podcast (I Doubt It) on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify or at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dollemore.com">https://www.dollemore.com</a><br /><br />#DollemoreDaily #DonaldTrump #ToiletGate<br /><br />Support with PayPal – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dollemore.com/paypal">https://www.dollemore.com/paypal</a><br /><br />Support with CRYPTOCURRENCY - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dollemore.com/support-show-w-crypto/">https://dollemore.com/support-show-w-crypto/</a><br /><br />Buy some merch – Buy a T-Shirt, Hoodie, Mug, or Tote – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dollemore.info">https://www.dollemore.info</a><br /><br />TRE45ON SHIRTS AVAILABLE AT <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dollemore.info">http://www.dollemore.info</a><br /><br />Podcast Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/IDoubtItPodcast">https://www.facebook.com/IDoubtItPodcast</a><br /><br />Podcast Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/IDoubtItPodcast">https://www.twitter.com/IDoubtItPodcast</a><br /><br />Jesse on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/dollemore">https://www.twitter.com/dollemore</a><br /><br />Brittany Page on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/brittanyepage">https://www.twitter.com/brittanyepage</a><br /><br />Sources:<br /><br />- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/09/trump-archives-justice-department/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2022/02/09/trump-archives-justice-department/</a>{% endraw %}
