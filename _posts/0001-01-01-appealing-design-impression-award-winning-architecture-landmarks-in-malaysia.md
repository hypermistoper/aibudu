{% raw %}Welcome to DESIGN SEED! As we were going around the southern region of Malaysia, we stumbled upon this remarkable flash of light just along the highway and we knew it was definitely something worth exploring. <br /><br />The steel sun shading façade that created a glow of reflection caught our eye. The prismatic geometries that goes around the façade creates a compelling feature to the surrounding landscape. <br /><br />This project has proven an interesting theory right, with the prismatic sun shading façade, it has made a literal glass box architecture proven to be possible in this Malaysian tropical weather. <br /><br />Another inspiring piece by Architect Razin, a simple characteristic on a basic form dressed with impact that gives a new identity to Modern Islamic architecture. <br /><br />If you enjoyed this episode, do subscribe to us and click on that notification bell and stay in the loop of more compelling design and architecture related contents!
