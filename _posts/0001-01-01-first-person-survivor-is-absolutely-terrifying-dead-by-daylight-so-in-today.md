{% raw %}So in today's Dead by Daylight video I'm back on the private server, this time I'm doing first person survivor! This was so much fun to record and I really hope you guys enjoy!<br /><br />This was done on the Private Server, not the Live Servers of DBD.<br /> <br />Mod by Daylight: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/x5r4q7kwt8">https://discord.gg/x5r4q7kwt8</a><br />Console Mod Creator: krumpuswumpus# 0002<br />Invisible Cosmetic Mod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gamebanana.com/mods/302801">https://gamebanana.com/mods/302801</a><br /><br />Please like and subscribe if you enjoyed the video!<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/fubs">https://twitch.tv/fubs</a><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/m9NGehU">https://discord.gg/m9NGehU</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/fubsTV">https://twitter.com/fubsTV</a><br />Connectors YT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxM3uRbfkZgHJGHFra5E-Mg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxM3uRbfkZgHJGHFra5E-Mg</a><br />Outro Music by Kalaido:<br />â†’  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5LXHT7v9uYGrsyEnL9q9K8">https://open.spotify.com/artist/5LXHT7v9uYGrsyEnL9q9K8</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------- <br /><br />Dead by daylight (DBD), an asymmetrical horror game, I play at rank 1 with builds such as the solo getaway build or the impossible to hook me build, to juke killers at rank 1, I love to run killers for 5 gens at rank 1 and do challenges at rank 1, like no pallets at rank 1, how to pip in rank 1 is good too. Dead by daylight has some toxic survivors and toxic killers who run meta builds to gain an advantage, I like to play with fun builds and less op addons, op perks or op builds, most op survivor builds and most op killer builds. Like the all seeing eyes build, the efficient survivor build, the instant heal tank build, the most underrated perks in the game and infinite sprint burst and head on, builds like the vault speed build to avoid dedicated servers or bad hitboxes on windows and pallets. How to counter every killer, even Killer Tier Lists, Gen rushing builds and Meta Builds, Builds to counter killers, Looping builds and more. I use inspiration for some of my videos from other players like The JRM with his .exe videos and Otzdarva with his win streaks, No0b3 with his once upon a toxic series and Ayrun with the vault speed build. I usually play with Feng Min or Claudette Morel. <br /><br />Rank reset is always scary, rank 20 vs rank 1 with brand new parts and flashlights. I always upload the new chapter, new survivor and new killer when it comes out with the new update. I love using techs like the dumb tech, ayrun tech, cj tech, locker tech, enjoy the video!<br /><br />I lost a bet so this is my description now.<br /><br />Thank you guys for watching :){% endraw %}
