{% raw %}Amazing tricks and fun experiments you can repeat at home<br /><br />Hello, friends :) I’m sure you will love this portion of awesome experiments that you can repeat at home! Let’s start with some simple but fun tricks. Get some hydrogel balls and add water to them. It’s so cool to see these balls disappear in the water :) Get a whiteboard marker and draw something on your hand, a spoon, or another object. Put it in the water to see how your drawing is going to be swimming and moving there :) Looks fun! I recommend all crafty parents to show these clever tricks to their kids!<br />Do you love experiments with balloons? We will show you a couple of them in this video too! In the first one, we will turn a regular balloon into a ball with the help of electrical tape! See how we did it in the video ;)<br />Watch the video till the end to find more unusual and mind-blowing experiments!<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />00:17 — Experiment with hydrogel balls and water<br />01:03 — Experiment with magnet and iron sand<br />02:22 — Drawing on milk with food dyes<br />03:37 — Experiment with a balloon and electrical tape<br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
