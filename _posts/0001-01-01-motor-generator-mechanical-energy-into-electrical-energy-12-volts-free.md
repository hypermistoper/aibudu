{% raw %}In this experiment I created a mechanical manual movement system for charging 12 volt batteries. The purpose of this video is to demonstrate to those who have interest, to realize a valid and safe method to obtain energy always free, easy and interesting.. The duration of battery charging time is subject to the time of execution of the manual movement. Required: motor/dynamo of at least 6 to 24 volts. Electrolitic capacitor 75000 mF to 100000 mF maximum. Stabilizer filter, inductance of a 200 watt electric pump or other generic 200 watt inductance. Non-return diode 15-20 amps. Minimum weight to counteract the absorption effort manual charge current, 15 Kg. Pulley for the dynamo. A washing machine flywheel. Iron or wood axis to couple weights and flywheel. Wooden handle to fix it to the flywheel. NOTE : In this video the rotation time is 5 minutes, with 9-10 amperes. But the battery to have a decent power, It must rotate for at least 10 -12 minutes with 9 -10 absorption amperes.{% endraw %}
