{% raw %}Chargeable weight, volumetric weight, and actual weight. What are they? (Differences explained)<br /><br />One of the most confusing parts when it comes to calculating shipping costs is associated with chargeable weight. Carriers take both the size and weight of your package into consideration when determining the shipping fees. The weight of the package is important, but sometimes the amount of space it takes up on the truck or plane is given even more consideration. In other words, in logistics, cargo density matters a lot. Let's start with giving definitions to the key terms.<br /><br />▶ Chargeable (i.e., billable) weight: is the value on which a carrier will raly when deciding on how much to charge for shipping.<br />▶ Gross (i.e., actual or dead) weight: is what the majority of people not related to the logistics field understand under &quot;weight&quot;. In simple words, it's how heavy the parcel or pallet is.<br />▶ Volumetric (i.e., dimensional) weight: is a method of measurement calculated using the dimensions of the package.<br /><br />Shipping costs are based on the greater of the actual weight or dimensional weight. The reason is that in logistics, the amount of space in the warehouse, aircraft, or container is limited. Therefore, it doesn't sound fair to charge the same costs for a 1kg acoustic guitar or a 1k jar of jam since the guitar takes as much space as ~20 jars. The scarcity of space involved in the transportation and storage of goods led to an evaluation of weight and volume becoming a common practice.<br /><br />For that matter, automatic (in-line) dimension systems were implemented. To measure the length such systems use speed-based tachometers, while height and width are measured either by a laser scanner or a light curtain. Since automation allows checking the volumetric weight of parcels quickly and cheaply, almost all carriers have such systems in place. Thus, although for those who ship high-density items, volumetric weight most likely would not be an issue, and for those who ship low-density ones, it definitely will.<br /><br />So, how do we calculate the volumetric weight? Well, it depends on if you want to store the pallets in the warehouse, ship out by sea or by air.<br /><br />1. Warehouse:<br />When it comes to a warehouse, 1 cubic meter equals one ton.<br />Pallet/Box: Dimensional (volumetric) weight (t) = Length x Width x Height (m)<br />Cylinder: Dimensional (volumetric) weight (t) = Height x Diameter x Diameter (m)<br />Example:<br />Let's say you have a standard pallet (i.e., each side is 1m). It weighs 1.5t. Thus, 1m3 is considered 1t. 1t is less than 1.5t. As a result, the actual weight will be the chargeable weight.<br /><br />2. LCL Shipments:<br />The rule to calculate volume weight when it comes to LCL shipments is in a sense similar to the warehousing one. Chargeable weight is the greater of actual weight in tons and volumetric weight in cubic meters (CBM).<br />Dimensional (volumetric) weight = Length x Width x Height (cm) / 1,000,000<br />Example:<br />We have a 30 x 50 x 30cm box of 50kg. 50kg equals 0.05t. (30 x 30 x 50) / 1,000,000 = 0.045 cbm. Since 0.5t exceeds 0.45 cbm, the actual weight will apply.<br /><br />3. Airfreight / Shipping carriers<br />When it comes to air freight or shipping carriers (DHL, FedEx, etc.) the formula is pretty simple.<br />Box: Dimensional (volumetric) weight (kg) = Length x Width x Height (m) / DIM*<br />Cylinder: Dimensional (volumetric) weight (kg) = Height x Diameter x Diameter (cm) / DIM*<br />*volumetric divisor provided by a carrier.<br />The key part of the formula is DIM. DIM is a factor used to calculate the volumetric weight of an object. It may vary per carrier and in some cases, per country zone. Usually DIM is either 4000, 5000, or 6000. Currently, most large carriers use cm3/kg, and DIMs of 6000 and 5000 to calculate volume weight and have their own calculators on their websites to help you with the calculations.<br />Example:<br />Let's say you are shipping a box of clothes. Its size is 30 x 50 x 25cm, while actual weight is 2kg. If DIM is 6000, then the volumetric weight is (30 x 50 x 25) / 6000 = 6.25kg. Since 6.25 is more than 2, the volumetric weight will be the chargeable weight.<br /><br />▶ Full blog article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.delivered.co.kr/chargeable-weight-volume-weight-or-actual-weight-what-are-they/">https://www.delivered.co.kr/chargeable-weight-volume-weight-or-actual-weight-what-are-they/</a><br /><br />▶ Follow us on Instagram (@deliveredkorea) to be the first one to know about reviews, news and events! ❤️ <br /><br />▶ CONNECT WITH US<br />* Website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.delivered.co.kr/">https://www.delivered.co.kr/</a> <br />* Blog <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.delivered.co.kr/guide-to-korea/">https://www.delivered.co.kr/guide-to-korea/</a> <br />* Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/deliveredkorea">https://twitter.com/deliveredkorea</a> <br />* Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/DeliveredKR">https://www.facebook.com/DeliveredKR</a><br />* Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/deliveredkorea/">https://www.instagram.com/deliveredkorea/</a> <br />* E-mail Customer Support: support@delivered.co.kr Dropship/Partnership: sales@delivered.co.kr <br />* Free Korean Warehouse Address Busan Design Center Centum Dong-ro 57(or U-dong 1457) #B102, [YOUR SUITE], Haeundae-gu, Busan city, S.Korea, 48059 <br />* Get Free Korean Address and Get $2 coupon <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://service.delivered.co.kr/#direct_sign_up">https://service.delivered.co.kr/#direct_sign_up</a><br /><br /><br />ⓒ 2021.
