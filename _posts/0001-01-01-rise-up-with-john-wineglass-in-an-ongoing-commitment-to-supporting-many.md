{% raw %}In an ongoing commitment to supporting many of today’s most important musical voices, the Fresno Philharmonic and Rei Hotoda announce “Rise Up!” This monthlong video streaming series, coinciding with Black History Month, features performances and conversations between Rei and four African American composers whose works were recently performed by the Fresno Philharmonic. In the first episode, John Wineglass and Rei discuss the importance of creativity during times of crisis in remarks from the stage before the Fresno Philharmonic’s October 2021 world premiere performance of his Alone/Together.  This poignant and emotionally-charged new work was recently selected to be included in the permanent collection of COVID-19 response art at the Library of Congress.<br /><br /><br />00:00-06:14 - Interview<br />06:15-14:23 - Strange Pandemic Times<br />14:24-18:30 - Ray of Hope{% endraw %}
