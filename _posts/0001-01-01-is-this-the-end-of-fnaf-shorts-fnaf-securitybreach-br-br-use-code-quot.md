Cheese's and ShowBiz Pizza Place. The restaurant has life-size animatronic characters that perform at children's parties. The animatronics wander the restaurant at night and the guard is instructed to watch over them. To progress through the games, the player must guard theirself against animatronics with a variety of tools. In Five Nights at Freddy's, the player can control the two security doors connecting their office to the adjacent hallways as a barrier against animatronics in the vicinity. Each night, the player has a power supply that depletes faster when a tool is used. If the power goes out, the player can no longer use any tools, and is defenseless against the animatronics. Five Nights at Freddy's 2 has different tools; there are no protective doors, and the player must instead use an empty animatronic head and flashlight to defend theirself against the animatronics. The game introduced a music box which must be remotely wound up on a regular basis to prevent an attack from a particular animatronic.8-bit minigames were introduced, which play randomly after death.<br /><br />he player takes control of a young boy named Gregory, who is locked in a large shopping mall filled with murderous animatronics and must complete numerous missions to survive the night in order to escape. The animatronics found throughout the mall include Glamrock Freddy, Glamrock Chica, Montgomery Gator, Roxanne Wolf, Sunnydrop and his nighttime counterpart Moondrop (also known as the Daycare Attendant), and DJ Music Man. The player will also encounter other types of enemies, which consists of Vanny, a woman dressed in a rabbit costume, employee robots called Staff Bots that can alert enemies to Gregory's location if they spot him, and a security guard named Vanessa. All enemies will get stronger as the night progresses, so the player must adapt to their surroundings in order to survive. Gregory can hide to avoid enemies or throw objects to distract them. Running drains stamina and if it's low, Gregory will not be able to move very fast. <br /><br />Do you like fnaf? What is the best Fnaf game?
