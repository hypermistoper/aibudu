So they're using this opportunity this very scary subway shooting to kick homeless people.  They're gonna critique I think Eric Adams about this but Eric Adams is essentially saying the same thing on cable news this morning, but here they take an interesting angle in which they agree with some of the alleged shooter's anti-homeless rants. that's a bold strategy let's see how it pays it works out for you. [External video] So say this shooter was a Muslim person who had posted about the way that America had conducted its foreign policy as a motivation for their assault in the subway. Would we be hearing any commentary that's sympathetic with their motives would it be a well they were out just asking for it? I mean that was that's the equivalent of what they were saying there I mean he's right about that is what Ainsley said that's true actually about some of his you know deranged motivations, allegedly if he is the person who ended up being the shooter who for wreaking havoc and violence.{% endraw %}
