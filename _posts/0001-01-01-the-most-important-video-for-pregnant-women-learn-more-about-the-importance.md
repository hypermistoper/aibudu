But, you can control your genes through epigenetics by committing to different lifestyle changes. <br /><br />The most crucial time to eat right is when you're pregnant. During this time, the baby is entirely dependent on the mother's nutrients. If something is missing, it can create a devastating chain reaction in the child's future existence.<br /><br />Nutrients, especially trace minerals, are essential for enzymes and proteins to work. This doesn't just apply to metabolism and building a body, but also the repair enzymes within the DNA. <br /><br />A genetic mutation is a change in your code that can occur from either being exposed to a toxin or having a micronutrient deficiency. One big problem is that our food is grown on soils missing certain nutrients, which could lead to deficiencies and have devastating effects. <br /><br />Overall, we have not given enough emphasis on micronutrients and their importance in making sure our genes are stable. If you're not already, it's time to start eating healthy and getting the right micronutrients, especially if you're pregnant. <br /><br />ADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description">https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description</a><br /><br />FREE COURSE‚ûú ‚ûú <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse">http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse</a><br /><br />Talk to a Dr. Berg Keto Consultant today and get the help you need on your journey.
