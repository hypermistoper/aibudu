Sonde’s proprietary technology works by sensing and analyzing subtle changes in the voice to create a range of persistent brain, muscle, and respiratory health measurements that provide a more complete picture of health in just seconds. Sonde’s vocal biomarker program has demonstrated the potential to effectively screen and monitor for disease using information obtained from an individual’s voice on commonly-owned devices, and it has the potential to fundamentally change the way mental and physical health is monitored and diagnosed.{% endraw %}
