{% raw %}Two days of snorkeling in Port Ghalib (Marsa Alam). Around the area at the Marina View Port Ghalib Hotel beach. The entrace to the harbour is a really nice place for snorkeking. We found turtles, rays and loads of small reef fish around there. We stayed at the Marina Lodge which is on the opposite site of Port Ghalib Resort. You can snorkel on both sides of the harbor.<br /><br />Filmed with Sony RX-100 IV in Sony housing.<br /><br />Underwater fotos can be found here: www.shutterstock.com/g/buchpetzer/sets/250330574?rid=254611629{% endraw %}
