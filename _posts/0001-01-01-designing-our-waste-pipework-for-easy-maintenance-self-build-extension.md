{% raw %}In this video weâ€™ll have a quick look at how our waste pipework is designed and some of the decisions we made along the way. Remember this was mostly designed by our architect and pre-agreed with building control in advance of the build starting. Lots of different ways of doing things. Always check with your architect and local BCO (building control officer).<br /><br />Follow this project in more detail at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://selfbuildextension.co.uk/">https://selfbuildextension.co.uk/</a><br /><br />Fan of the channel?
