{% raw %}Decontrol- Drist<br /><br />Really hard song to squeeze because it has a really high BPM.  Missing 600 or more, just happy I got 310K.  The first couple squeezes are really tough to get, and even if you do hit them, you have the really hard solo to deal with afterword.  This is a top 5 hardest song in this game.<br /><br />My scores:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.scorehero.com/scores.php?user=560643&amp;group=1&amp;game=1&amp;diff=4">http://www.scorehero.com/scores.php?user=560643&amp;group=1&amp;game=1&amp;diff=4</a>{% endraw %}
