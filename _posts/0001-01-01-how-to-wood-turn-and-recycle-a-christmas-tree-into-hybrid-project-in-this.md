{% raw %}In this woodturning video, I will turn our Christmas tree into a hybrid golden red plate or platter. Used epoxy resin a coloured red and gold mica pigments powder to achieve this cool colour combination. With the help of my woodturning lathe I was able to recycle this wood instead of going into the bin.
