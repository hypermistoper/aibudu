{% raw %}Aterian stock ($ATER) has been at the forefront of retail tradersâ€™ interests once again due to its high short interest. Today I break down the key price levels for $ATER and what to watch for on the chart as the stock navigates this trading week. We then look at the Aterian short interest data on Ortex and end with the unusual whale's option flow. We have seen $ATER be toyed with by shorts over the past year, and it doesnâ€™t seem like shorts are stopping anytime soon. Definitely keep an eye on $ATER price as it is trading at a key level that I believe, will ultimately determine the trend.<br /><br />0:00  Intro<br />0:52 Chart Update <br />5:02 Current Key Levels <br />8:07  Option Chain<br />11:51 Short Interest Update <br />12:03 Final Thoughts<br /><br />NOT Financial Advice.
