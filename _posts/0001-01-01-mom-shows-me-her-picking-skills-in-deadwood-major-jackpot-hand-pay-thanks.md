This limits the time that I have to respond. I try to answer each and every comment. I love hearing from those that like my vids! Thanks for watching, liking, commenting and subscribing! If you hear me while Im playing, please say hello. Every Video I Upload Is Shot IN A REAL CASINO! This Is Real Play, Using Real Money and Having Real Risk. I strive to show the viewer the realest casino experience possible while also providing an entertaining experience. The truth is the house always wins. I Do Feel That My Extensive Knowledge Of The Casino Industry Makes Me A Smarter Gambler and I Lose Less Money on A Dollar Per Dollar Comparison Than 99% of Other Slot Players. However, I Still Lose At The End Of The Year When Looking At The Year As A Whole. These videos are posted In An Attempt To Help You To Become A Smarter Gambler And Learn About Different Ways To Play Slots. Slots Are Fun! Stick To Your Budget and Play Responsibly.{% endraw %}
