{% raw %}What's the best time frame to trade with that will make you the most profits? In this video, I'll reveal the best time frame to trade for beginners. Whether you're a forex trader or stocks trader, you will be able to determine the best trading style and best time frame for you. <br /><br />I'll talk about the various forex time frames and stock time frames in which you can consider (M5, M15, M30, H1, H4, D1, WK and MTH). A lot of traders make the mistake of choosing the small time frames and end up losing money. <br /><br />The various time frames cater to different trading style and trading personalities.
