{% raw %}The toilet paper industry has been confusing people (like me) for years now. &quot;We're 4x more absorbent than the competitors! Our roll lasts twice as long as the leading bargain brand! Rub it on your face or we're gonna freak out!&quot; <br /><br />I wanted to do my own research and compare as many different types of toilet paper as I could to see who really is the best. Length, absorbency, effectiveness at TPing someone's house, we're testing it all today. Enjoy! <br /><br />MERCH<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://strugglrshop.com">https://strugglrshop.com</a><br /><br />PATREON<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patreon.com/ScottsTOL">https://patreon.com/ScottsTOL</a><br /><br />INSTAGRAM<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/ScottCramersLife">https://instagram.com/ScottCramersLife</a><br /><br />TWITTER<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/ScottsTOL">https://www.twitter.com/ScottsTOL</a><br /><br />SECOND CHANNEL<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/ScottIsStruggling">https://www.youtube.com/ScottIsStruggling</a><br /><br />Scott Cramer<br />PO Box 131<br />Horace, ND 58047<br /><br />0:00 I'm confused by toilet paper<br />2:19 Shopping<br />4:43 Length Test<br />7:59 Absorbency<br />12:05 TP Someone's House<br />16:14 Wipe Test<br />18:09 Softness<br />21:20 Cost &amp; Other Stuff<br />22:30 Which is best?<br /><br />#ScottCramer<br /><br />GEAR I USE<br />Main Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3zlk85u">https://amzn.to/3zlk85u</a><br />Main Camera Lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2TktuxU">https://amzn.to/2TktuxU</a><br />Secondary Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3MFjndi">https://amzn.to/3MFjndi</a><br />Secondary Camera Lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3F57uuR">https://amzn.to/3F57uuR</a>{% endraw %}
