We got to link up with Javon Walton aka Wanna aka Ashtray from Euphoria! Honestly though, he's probably the coolest 15 year old in the world. <br /><br />Wanna comes from an amazing family and they let us spend a few days with them. He just starred as Ashtray in Euphoria, but he's SO MUCH MORE than that. Wanna is also a boxing prodigy. He trains nonstop and has goals of being a world champion. His dad trains him and the whole fam gets after it. <br /><br />He's also continuing his acting career and figuring out what his next roles are. This dude does not stop working!!! I can't wait to see his next show or movie. <br /><br />If boxing and acting weren't enough, Wanna is also a huge sneaker head. We went to Sneakercon with him and let's just say, it was insane. He can't walk two steps without being stopped - it's legendary.<br /><br />But most importantly, Wanna's an awesome dude. You can see it in this video, he's just a happy kid who has big dreams. He comes from a dope family and they all push each other to be the best. It's amazing seeing someone with this much success, be so genuine and still be hungry. <br /><br />Can't wait to see what happens in the future. <br /><br />Love y'all<br />---------------------------------<br />Follow Us...
