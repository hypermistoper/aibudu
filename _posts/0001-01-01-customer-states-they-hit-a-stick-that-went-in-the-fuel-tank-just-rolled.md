No extra info regarding this clip but very unfortunate for the customer.<br />0:22 Technician didn't mention what kind of vehicle this was on, but that is quite the rear differential carnage. Most likely on an SUV that is AWD. So FWD would still work, but you'd probably hear the noise in the rear. Surprised they didn't mention anything but I've seen it before.<br />0:35 The customer drove this in, just in case you're wondering.<br />0:57 Never repair the sidewall of a tire. The technician said it was holding air, but that can and will blow out at any second. Those orange things are tire plugs as well. The ones you can find at gas stations and such to easily plug a hole in a tire. <br />1:11 Technician said this was on an F10 BMW (5-series I think?). <br />Most places won't repair a tire more than 3 times. I think I saw 10 plug/patch and 1  plug in that tire. Time for a new tire!<br />1:26 2022 F-150 - 1500 miles / 2414 kilometres. It's a fleet truck and they usually idle for long periods of time so they brought it in for the first oil change and tire rotation. The technician noticed the ball joint was missing the nut as described and seemed to be incorrectly installed from the factory. You can also see the threads of the lower ball joint to be pretty clean like it never had a nut installed on it at any point.<br />1:41 Technician said: &quot;This truck had the following wrong: Missing sway bar links, Worn out inner tie rods, brake lines dangling over the control arms, all grease fittings missing, RF ABS cable cut out, Incorrect ball joint RF lower, Worn ball joint LF Lower, Upper control arm cam bolts installed backward, Brakes metal-metal RR, bolt missing from the caliper and Pitman and Idler's arms worn.&quot;<br />You can't properly do an alignment with worn steering and suspension components.<br />2:06 Thought it was funny enough to share with you guys.<br />2:21 They didn't mention what kind of tractor but seems to be an older CASE tractor possibly from the 80s. <br />2:39 Cool way to hide your new radio in an older vehicle to keep the classy look.<br />2:47 I thought you guys would enjoy seeing this Lincoln again and see what you have to do to start it. If anybody has more info. regarding this, please let us know.<br />3:13 Outro. Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
