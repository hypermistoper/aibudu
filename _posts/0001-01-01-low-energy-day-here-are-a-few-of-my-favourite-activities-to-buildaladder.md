{% raw %}What is &quot;Build A Ladder&quot;? Well, it's a concept that I use of building many little wins throughout the day by appreciating and acknowledging the small things in life. <br /><br />ðŸªœ Adding rungs on the ladder are simple: seeing a nice cloud, getting out of bed, taking a shower,  meeting a friend, having a cup of tea...all of these are WINS that we usually take for granted as deem &quot;unimportant&quot; in comparison to other things in life. <br /><br />I think it is important to acknowledge that ALL the steps in life, all the small things, are wins. <br /><br />ðŸ”¨ As we build our rungs, our ladder grows and lift us away from &quot;the pit&quot; our minds fall into when dealing with chronic pain, depression, anxiety, overthinking and more.  We might fall off our ladder or a rung might break, but we know how to re-build.<br /><br />ðŸ’• It's okay to take life one rung at a time, and to be happy with completing and experiencing   the small things. They are just as important as the &quot;big&quot; things. We don't always need to be in hustle culture and in constant productivity mode.<br /><br />#shorts #buildaladder{% endraw %}
