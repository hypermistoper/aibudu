My fading supply<br /><br />“Did you get enough love, my little dove<br />Why do you cry?<br />And I’m sorry I left, but it was for the best<br />Though it never felt right<br />My little Versailles.”<br /><br />The hospital asked should the body be cast <br />Before I say goodbye, my star in the sky<br />Such a funny thought to wrap you up in cloth<br />Do you find it all right, my dragonfly?<br /><br />“Shall we look at the moon, my little loon<br />Why do you cry?<br />Make the most of your life, while it is rife<br />While it is light<br /><br />Well you do enough talk<br />My little hawk, why do you cry?<br />Tell me what did you learn from the Tillamook burn?<br />Or the Fourth of July?<br />We’re all gonna die.”{% endraw %}
