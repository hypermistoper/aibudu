{% raw %}Hello everyone, welcome back with us again at another episode on Military TV! We are going to take a look on a high-tech weapon firing projectiles at tremendous speeds even up to six to seven times faster than sound! Yes, such of this typical weapon is called Railgun! Perhaps, it might come into mind “would it be possible if this weapon replace conventional guns in the future?”  Anyway, I don’t think anyone will get the real answer until you guys are watching a full video of today’s episode! <br /><br />It is widely known that technology is on the way to making step from science fiction into reality in the twenty-first century. When compared to smart bombs and missiles, the concept has the potential to provide an effective weapon for pennies on the dollar. Railguns, the weapons that propel projectiles over 100 miles at hypersonic speeds utilising electrical power, instead of using gunpowder or jet or rocket motors, it employs electricity. As of 2020, railguns have been researched as weapons utilising electromagnetic forces to impart a very high kinetic energy to a projectile rather than using conventional propellants. <br /><br /><br />All content on Military TV is presented for educational purposes.<br /><br />Subscribe Now : <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0IlEuu4TA9wq1u60tLMqBw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0IlEuu4TA9wq1u60tLMqBw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MilitaryTV.Channel">https://www.facebook.com/MilitaryTV.Channel</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://defense-tv.com/">http://defense-tv.com/</a>{% endraw %}
