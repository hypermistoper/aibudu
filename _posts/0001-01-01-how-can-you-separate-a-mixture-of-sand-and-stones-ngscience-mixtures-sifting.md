{% raw %}#ngscience #mixtures #sifting<br /><br />Here's how to separate a mixture of sand and stones.<br /><br />We can use our knowledge of the properties of matter to separate the parts of a mixture in different ways. Such properties include size, density, magnetism, evaporation and boiling point.<br /><br />Sifting is a process that can be used to separate a mixture of solids made up of large and small particles. To separate a mixture by sifting, we use a sieve. A sieve is a tool with a meshed bottom. By sifting a mixture of solids through the mesh, the larger solids remain in the sieve and the smaller solids pass through the holes in the mesh thereby separating the solids.<br /><br />Sifting is often used to separate water and food when cooking. A strainer is a type of sieve often used to separate foods like pasta and rice from the water in which it was cooked.<br /><br />So, what is a mixture?<br />A bowl of fruit salad contains different kinds of matter. It contains different kinds of berries. The fruit salad is an example of a mixture. A mixture is two or more kinds of matter that are mixed together. The different kinds of matter in a mixture retain their individual chemical properties, but the mixture may have new properties. It may be different in color, taste or have different melting and boiling points.<br /><br />Take a teaspoon of table salt and stir it into a glass of warm water. After a while, you will not be able to see the salt in the water. The salt dissolves in the water forming a solution of salt water. A solution is a mixture in which the matter has blended completely and remain evenly mixed.{% endraw %}
