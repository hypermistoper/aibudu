{% raw %}The Top 10 Most Racist States in the United States of America. Racism takes many forms as some of these places are the BEST States to Live in, while others are among the WORST States in the USA!<br /><br />➽ Check out our WEBSITE!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fromheretotheretravel.com/">http://fromheretotheretravel.com/</a><br />➽ Join the OFFICIAL From Here to There Discord Server!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/gH2svJbW">https://discord.gg/gH2svJbW</a><br /><br />► Cheapest States for 2021 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/F9uQyd-q8Ac">https://youtu.be/F9uQyd-q8Ac</a><br />► Best States to Live in - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rgqgyIdvbD8">https://youtu.be/rgqgyIdvbD8</a><br /><br />It's very difficult to determine which US states are the most racist (and least racist), as most racist people aren't going to admit that they have hateful or discriminatory views. So a study analyzed anonymous social media listening data from twitter activity and google searches to see just how racist the people of each state are!<br />Of course, a majority of people in the following states aren't racist, and a lot racism comes from ignorance as many of these places are also the Whitest States! Some of them are also home to some of the best cities and small towns live in, in addition to beautiful nature though, so my biggest suggestion is to visit these states first to decide where you want to move to and live.<br /><br />➽ SUBSCRIBE for 2-3 new videos EVERY WEEK!<br /><br />Thanks for watching From Here to There!
