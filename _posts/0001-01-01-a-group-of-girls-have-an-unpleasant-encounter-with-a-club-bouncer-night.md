They plan to hit up clubs and bars, but there's only one hitch: only one of them is actually 21.<br /><br />Still, they have fake IDs and a plan to sweet-talk the bouncer at the club. But their plan to have a good time proves harder to execute than they thought -- thanks to a subtle but brilliantly unexpected flip in this thoughtful, intellectually provocative drama.<br /><br />Director Joosje Duk's acclaimed short drama starts with a daring, subversive script that upends notions of hot-button issues like racism, sexism and privilege in a playful yet powerful way.  The film is further carried by smart, skilled performances and equally well-crafted direction. There's obvious intelligence behind the story, but &quot;Night&quot; manages to connect its big ideas to the everyday experiences of friendship, exploring what happens when people aren't open, honest or accepting of one another.<br /><br />It all comes together in a short but powerful cinematic experience that truly explores a story's ability to let the audience walk in another person's shoes and move towards compassion and understanding.<br /><br />ABOUT OMELETO<br />Omeleto is the home of the world's best short films.
