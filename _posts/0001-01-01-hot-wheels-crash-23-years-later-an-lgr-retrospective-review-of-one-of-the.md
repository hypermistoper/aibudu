{% raw %}Review of one of the most straightforward, aptly-named PC games of the 90s: Hot Wheels Crash! It's a game where you crash Hot Wheels cars. That’s about it! It’s simple and it’s over in less than an hour, but I always have a constant grin watching the vehicular carnage unfold. Let's take a look back at it 23 years later here in this LGR retrospective!<br /><br />● LGR links:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/LazyGameReviews">https://www.patreon.com/LazyGameReviews</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/LazyGameReviews">https://www.twitter.com/LazyGameReviews</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/LazyGameReviews">https://www.facebook.com/LazyGameReviews</a><br /><br />● All background music licensed from:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.epidemicsound.com">http://www.epidemicsound.com</a><br /><br />#LGR #HotWheels #Review{% endraw %}
