{% raw %}Making a new house inside our dock üèùÔ∏è<br /><br />JOIN OUR FAM!! --- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/rfgp8V">http://goo.gl/rfgp8V</a><br /> <br />Best Pirate Island Day Ever 1246<br /><br />Adley and I have packed our bags, gathered up some toys and her ipad, and are getting ready to go. Not on a family vacation or an airplane ride, but to pirate island! We are camping at the lake...in the house lol! So here is whats going on. Niko woke up this morning not feeling very well. After going and getting him tested, turns out Niko Bear has the sickness. So in order to take care of everyone, and to play everything super safe, Jenny is staying at our house with Niko and Navey while we go to the lake. <br /><br />So we give you a house tour of the place, our new bed and kitchen area. While we are showing you around, Adley gets out the tape. But instead of setting up a trap, Adley is separating the space kids vs dad style. We also realize that we haven't had dinner, so time for pizza! Do they deliver to islands?!!<br /><br />After we eat, Adley has the idea to run around pirate island looking at all the lights and visiting chuck the pirate, who looks like the grich. We also say hi to all the dinosaurs, Adley giving kisses to a lot of them and naming all the babies and eggs that we find. It's been so cool having all these lights here for Christmas, and I can't wait to see what we do next year. <br /><br />Back inside our house, its time for our bed time routine. But first, Adley and I play some roblox. It's defiantly hard being separated from the family, but a silver lining is I'm getting some quality daddy daughter time with Adley.<br /><br />\\\\<br />Watch Adley's last video: ADLEY SURPRiSES for YOU ‚ù§Ô∏è Valentines Delivery from Mailman dad! my morning routine and heart merch ‚Äì <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9qOJhp01rfc">https://youtu.be/9qOJhp01rfc</a><br /><br />Watch yesterday's Best Day Ever: ADLEY can POOL SURF üèÑ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Hot Tub surfing in our backyard and Navey learns how to paint crafts!! -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/MhrAXsO5QxI">https://youtu.be/MhrAXsO5QxI</a><br />////<br />snag some sweet Spacestation merch --- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shopspacestation.com/">https://shopspacestation.com/</a><br /><br />Find me on any social media @Shonduras!!<br /><br />Don't forget to get Adley's free apps:<br />UNICORN CATCH<br />Apple -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unicorn...">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/unicorn...</a><br />Google Play Store -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...">https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...</a><br /><br />ADLEY'S PLAYSPACE<br />Apple -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adleys-...">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/adleys-...</a><br />Google Play Store -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...">https://play.google.com/store/apps/de...</a><br /><br />Best Music Ever: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/tPjTh">http://share.epidemicsound.com/tPjTh</a><br /><br />FUN WITH ADLEY:<br />AforAdley.com<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJu...">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBJu...</a><br />DAD'S SPACESTATION:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shonduras.com">https://shonduras.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spacestation.com">https://spacestation.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spacestationgaming.com">https://spacestationgaming.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spacestationintegrations.com">https://spacestationintegrations.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://remarketingspace.com/">https://remarketingspace.com/</a><br />FAMILY INSTAGRAMS:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shonduras">https://www.instagram.com/shonduras</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jennymcbride">https://www.instagram.com/jennymcbride</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/adleymcbride">https://www.instagram.com/adleymcbride</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/nikobearmcb...">https://www.instagram.com/nikobearmcb...</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/naveymcbride">https://www.instagram.com/naveymcbride</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />*highfive*<br />(leave a highfive in the comments if you read this far){% endraw %}
