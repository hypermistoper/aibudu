{% raw %}Adornment 2014  <br />Tattoo on male human, performance, video.   <br />This work is derived from studies of Adolf Loos who was an Austrian/Czechoslovak architect from the 19th century. He is most famous for his essay, Ornament and Crime, in which he writes that Ornament is useless and pointless in the Modern age and only inferior people use ornament in their dress, makeup, and tattoos. He claims that anyone who has a tattoo is or shall become a criminal. Loos also preached against ornamentation in architecture and was the first to discuss the parallels between ornamentation on the body / dress and in architecture. <br />The act of tattooing an ornamented version of Loos’ name materialised the two concepts he hated the most.  The man carrying the tattoo on his arm is now a living sculpture; the tattoo is the exhibit and the man’s life has become the gallery. People will see it, question it and thus create a dialogue. The work has become autonomous and independent from the artist.{% endraw %}
