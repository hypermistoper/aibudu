I'm going to be sleeping in the best room onboard, of which there are only three - a double ensuite room. The train should take around 12 hours to take me from one side of the country to the other. I've taken lots of sleeper trains recently, and this one is the first in my home country, how does this compare to the likes of Amtrak or indeed the Arctic Express? <br /><br />As with all my train videos, this will be a comprehensive trip report, from the moment I leave Inverness train station all the way down to London Euston station. We'll take a look at the food, a room tour of my exclusive First Class Cabin, what the shower is like and the amenities provided. I'll also take a look at coach class. <br /><br />0:00 - Introduction <br />1:09 - Inverness Station<br />2:00 - Getting Onboard<br />2:59 - Dinner <br />6:11 - Room tour<br />10:50 - The shower<br />11:36 - Breakfast<br />13:22 - London{% endraw %}
