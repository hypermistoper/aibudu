{% raw %}Note this is a video recording of an online meeting conducted using the Zoom.us platform. Inevitably such recordings suffer a little in terms of their production values because of the internet connectivity and quality of webcams. Despite that, they allow us to provide additional valuable insights in to the MedComms business and we can involve a wider range of speakers who can participate from the comfort of their own desks, wherever in the world they are.<br /><br />In this webinar we're joined by Kathryn White, author of our careers guide, &quot;Making it my own business: a guide to being a freelance writer in MedComms&quot; along with Steph Carter who has contributed her personal profile story to the latest edition. We'll talk about how MedComms is an area that offers experienced medical writers the opportunity to 'go it alone', with plenty of variety in terms of the type of projects and therapeutic areas. However, working as a freelancer means running a business. It's not enough to simply be a good writer. You'll also be responsible for sales, marketing, IT support, training, finance and more. And these are particularly challenging times. So, what does it take to be a successful freelance medical writer? And we answer questions from the audience. <br /><br />It should be of interest to anyone working in and around MedComms, but in particular to anyone who has already taken the leap into freelancing or is about to do so.<br /><br />Recorded 13 April 2022 as a MedComms Networking webinar.
