{% raw %}Visiting the restaurant Bridges in Amsterdam to have a 7 course dinner a their chefâ€˜s table which is placed right in the kitchen. During the video you will be seeing 2 boat captains coming to the kitchen to get their orders for the tour boats which serve dinner onboard. Depending on what type of steak you want to eat you have to choose the right place in the restaurant: For Japanese Wagyu steak you have a seat in the main restaurant, for the Angus steak you see in the video, a regular 300g Striploin steak, you have a seat in the bistro Oriole which is located beside the main restaurant.<br />Bridges is a Michelin Guide restaurant.{% endraw %}
