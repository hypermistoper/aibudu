And it’s only when you become aware that you become free of the past, and it’s only when you become free of the past that you become available to the present, and it’s only when you become available to the present that you become capable of knowing what you don’t know, and maybe, someone who’s capable of knowing what they don’t know is close to Nirvana—maybe, maybe not.<br /><br />OUR COURSES<br />_<br />Coming soon.
