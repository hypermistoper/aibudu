{% raw %}Come do some scarf dancing with Donald Duck! Great for all levels and abilities. Grab one scarf, or two scarves, and follow along with Donald. If you don't have a scarf, use a plastic bag, napkin, small towel, or any small piece of fabric. This workout can be done from the standing or seated position. <br /><br />Instagram: coachb_ape{% endraw %}
