{% raw %}This video is not monetized, and all pieces used have been trimmed/edited/mixed. The pieces were composed by Gareth Coker &amp; Joel Corelitz (of 343 Industries circa 2020 for Halo Infinite). I doubt saying these things will stop potential copyright strikes, but it was worth a shot... :P<br /><br />Looks like I’m going back to my roots on this one; a simple OST medley of all the times a theme is used in a soundtrack! Specifically, I’m tackling the Endless theme throughout Halo Infinite. This is definitely one of my favorite wholly new themes introduced for the game. It takes that vocal style that Halo 4 introduced and uses it to form a unique sound identity for the Endless (a sort of tragic hymn reflecting their history). Similar to how I felt all those years ago about the Osiris theme in Halo 5, I wanted to consolidate all the major times this theme (and choir style) was used in the OST.<br /><br />As I said before, the layout of this medley is pretty simple. It only uses the OST versions of the tracks in this order: Silent Auditorium (first third), which leads into Command Spire, which leads into Endless, which picks up as Judgement, then finally ends on A Message (first half). Enjoy! :)<br /><br />SoundCloud link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.app.goo.gl/izyJHk9ZxtsZhoSV6">https://soundcloud.app.goo.gl/izyJHk9ZxtsZhoSV6</a><br /><br />Regarding the visuals used for this medley, I was having a hard time finding any concept art of the Harbinger from a story perspective (like a cutscene or storyboard concept), so I went with the method of using various screenshots/footage from the game with a single piece of fan art depicting the boss fight (linked below as always).<br />Footage of the Harbinger’s cylix was taken in-game by me. <br />In-game screenshots of the Harbinger taken from the Halopedia article (see the gallery): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.halopedia.org/The_Harbinger">https://www.halopedia.org/The_Harbinger</a><br />Concept art of the Harbinger is by Ben Frazier: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.artstation.com/artwork/qQo9xa">https://www.artstation.com/artwork/qQo9xa</a><br />Fan art of the Harbinger boss fight is by BravoTKO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://br.ifunny.co/picture/halo-infinite-art-made-by-me-4CvVUwnA9">https://br.ifunny.co/picture/halo-infinite-art-made-by-me-4CvVUwnA9</a><br /><br />Disclaimer: Halo © Microsoft Corporation. “Unending” - A Halo Infinite Mini-Medley was created under Microsoft's &quot;Game Content Usage Rules&quot; (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/developers/rules).">http://www.xbox.com/en-us/developers/rules).</a> using assets from Halo, and it is not endorsed by or affiliated with Microsoft{% endraw %}
