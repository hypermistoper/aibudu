{% raw %}if you can't see zombie movies, don't watch this trailer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmC6ojtgyXI">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmC6ojtgyXI</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Ok, this is the hottest new 'Blair Witch Project' -esque movie. We are alone at home and weird freaky things are happening. Do you believe?<br /><br /><br /><br />Coming to theaters on September 25, 2009.<br /><br />Starring: Katie Featherston, Micah Sloat, Mark Fredrichs, Amber Armstrong, Ashley Palmer<br /><br /><br /><br />After a young, middle class couple moves into what seems like a typical suburban starter tract house, they become increasingly disturbed by a presence that may or may not be somehow demonic but is certainly most active in the middle of the night. Especially when they sleep. Or try to.{% endraw %}
