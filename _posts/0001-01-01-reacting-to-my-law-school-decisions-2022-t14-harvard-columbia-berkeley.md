{% raw %}It took over 6 months to FINALLY get my decisions to post this video and I am SO excited! ðŸ¥³ As some of you know I applied to law school last year, but decided to retake my LSAT and reapplied this year and it went WAY better than I expected. There were definitely highs and lows, but overall I am super proud of my results and can confidently say I AM GOING TO LAW SCHOOL! ðŸ˜­ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥° I applied to the entire T14 and a few extras since I was waitlisted by them all last year and wanted to be cautious. In all honesty this process has been really difficult and I appreciate all of you who have watched and been along with me on this journey. I can't wait to post where I will be attending and keep you up to date with moving and all of that stuff!<br /><br />Also I don't know what happened to my Michigan footage, but I was waitlisted LOL. <br /><br />For more content follow my other socials!<br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tydieofficial/">https://www.instagram.com/tydieofficial/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TyDieOfficial">https://twitter.com/TyDieOfficial</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/tydieofficial">https://www.twitch.tv/tydieofficial</a><br /><br />00:00 Still waiting on 1 decision LOL<br />01:08 Reapplicant - my previous cycle decisions<br />02:12 Georgetown<br />02:45 Dean Andy Video<br />03:05 Cornell<br />03:56 WUSTL<br />04:40 UCLA<br />05:39 Harvard!!<br />06:27 Penn (this one is SO wild LOL)<br />08:05 UVA<br />09:20 UChicago<br />10:15 NYU<br />12:03 Columbia<br />13:53 Northwestern<br />15:30 Duke<br />16:52 Berkeley<br />17:57 USC<br />19:06 Yale<br />20:04 NYU<br />21:11 Stanford (LOL)<br />21:56 What's Next?!{% endraw %}
