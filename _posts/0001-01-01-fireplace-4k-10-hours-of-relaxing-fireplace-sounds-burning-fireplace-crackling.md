Fireplaces are used for the relaxing ambiance they create and for heating a room. Modern fireplaces vary in heat efficiency, depending on the design.<br /><br />Historically, they were used for heating a dwelling, cooking, and heating water for laundry and domestic uses. A fire is contained in a firebox or fire pit; a chimney or other flue allows exhaust gas to escape. A fireplace may have the following: a foundation, a hearth, a firebox, a mantel; a chimney crane (used in kitchen and laundry fireplaces), a grate, a lintel, a lintel bar, a overmantel, a damper, a smoke chamber, a throat, a flue, and a chimney filter or afterburner.<br /><br />ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥<br /><br />It's a looped video that's perfect for splash screen or background playback!<br /><br />ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥<br /><br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br />Please, subscribe, like, comment and SHARE! :){% endraw %}
