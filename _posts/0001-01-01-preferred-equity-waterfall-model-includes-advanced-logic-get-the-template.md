{% raw %}Get the template: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.smarthelping.com/2019/10/preferred-equity-model-up-to-10-years.html">https://www.smarthelping.com/2019/10/preferred-equity-model-up-to-10-years.html</a><br />More cash flow waterfalls: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.smarthelping.com/p/joint-venture.html">https://www.smarthelping.com/p/joint-venture.html</a><br /><br />Preferred equity is different from a preferred return and may or may not contain a preferred return or an equity kicker. This template gives you a robust set of assumptions to tinker with based on what contributions/distributions you define. IRR hurdles do exist for common equity and sit under the preferred equity.<br /><br />This is generally used for real estate modeling, but it can be used for any kind of joint venture or business financing structures.<br /><br />Visuals have been included as well as final IRR and equity multiples.<br /><br />Note, I did update logic so you can run a scenario where the preferred equity is the only source of funding and the common equity/sponsor both contribute nothing. In that case, the sponsor just gets whatever is left after the preferred equity.<br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/smarthelping">https://twitter.com/smarthelping</a>{% endraw %}
