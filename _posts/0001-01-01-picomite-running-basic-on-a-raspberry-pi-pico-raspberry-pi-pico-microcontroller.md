{% raw %}Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller set up as a &quot;PicoMite&quot; running the MMBasic programming language from Geoff Graham. The PicoMite firmware and manual can be downloaded from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geoffg.net/picomite.html">https://geoffg.net/picomite.html</a><br /><br />To program the PicoMite I used the PuTTY terminal emulator, which can be downloaded from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.putty.org/">https://www.putty.org/</a><br /><br />The Monk Makes Breadboard for Pico is available here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/breadboard-for-pico">https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/breadboard-for-pico</a><br /><br />Please note that I have no association with any of the aforementioned individuals, websites and organizations, and that none of the above are associate links.<br /><br />The current limiting resistors used with the LEDs were 220 ohm.<br /><br />If you like this video, you may enjoy my previous episode where I demonstrate using  MicroPython to control LEDs and servos with a Raspberry Pi Pico: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDj2kcSA-68">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDj2kcSA-68</a><br /><br />More videos on SBCs and wider computing and related topics can be found at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/explainingcomputers">http://www.youtube.com/explainingcomputers</a><br /><br />You may also like my ExplainingTheFuture channel at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/explainingthefuture">http://www.youtube.com/explainingthefuture</a><br /><br />Chapters:<br />00:00 Introduction<br />00:48 Hardware<br />02:48 PicoMite Setup<br />08:14 BASIC Programs<br />11:52 Output Control<br />15:21 Switched On<br />17:06 BASIC Opportunities<br />18:33 Wrap<br /><br />#PicoMite #MMBasic #RaspberryPiPico #ExplainingComputers{% endraw %}
