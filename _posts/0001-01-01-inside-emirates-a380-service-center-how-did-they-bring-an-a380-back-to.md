{% raw %}I visited Emirates Engineering in Dubai, which is the world's biggest A380 maintenance facility and can house up to 11 A380’s at one time. It was an eye-opening tour; I’ve seen so many interesting things that we normally wouldn’t have the chance to.<br /><br />First, I was shown an Emirates A380 currently going through a heavy 3C check; with all cabin interiors, seats, panels and bins removed. It is very different from the fully decked-out A380 that we normally fly on.<br /><br />Next, another A380 was being prepared to return to service after storage and was undergoing a gear retraction check (gear swing). The 575-ton A380 was on three jacks, with its landing gear up. The engineer explained all the necessary tasks for the A380 to return to service. Take a look at all the interior work being carried out.<br /><br />Next, I visited the cabin interior seat shop; where you can find all the seats (First, Business and Economy Class) that came off the airplane and were being inspected. It is very interesting to see how engineers paint the panels and put wallpaper on planes.<br /><br />Finally, I visited the paint shop; to understand how they paint and apply special decals on airplanes. I saw the Emirates UAE 50th special anniversary livery in the paint shop too.<br /><br />I would like to dedicate this vlog to all the hard-working engineers, who work day and night to ensure the planes are well maintained and safe to fly.{% endraw %}
