{% raw %}Although I love endgame raiding in World of Warcraft, I've been told by countless people that they find catching up to be extremely difficult and tedious. With the recent announcement of WoW's upcoming Dragonflight expansion, I'd imagine that many new and returning players will be considering giving Shadowlands a shot. In order to help making the entry process into WoW's endgame easier, I put together this short video which will go over the important steps you should take in order to get caught up.<br /><br />If you're only just starting the game and haven't reached Level 60 yet, I'd recommend checking out my leveling guides.<br />This video has a guide for 1-50 Leveling: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/QSH4q1o2_aA">https://youtu.be/QSH4q1o2_aA</a><br />This video has a guide for 50-60 Leveling: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/guyNSE-EeFg">https://youtu.be/guyNSE-EeFg</a><br />And this document is a written version of both guides compiled into a single place: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gMy9THrOzhlZTyVYZNWzS-C1fyQy-GTnWz6miNsTbu0/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gMy9THrOzhlZTyVYZNWzS-C1fyQy-GTnWz6miNsTbu0/edit?usp=sharing</a><br /><br />If you want to learn how to craft your own piece of 262 Gear, you should check out this video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/O02QP-nh-cQ">https://youtu.be/O02QP-nh-cQ</a><br /><br />My video on &quot;The Secret Treasure Room in Zereth Mortis&quot; will tell you everything that you need to know in order to get 5 pieces of 246 item level gear.
