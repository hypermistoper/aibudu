{% raw %}#TheFantasticFour #JohnKrasinski #EmilyBlunt<br /><br />Here's our 'EXCLUSIVE TRAILER' concept for upcoming MCU Phase 4 movie titled 'The Fantastic Four' featuring John Krasinski, Emily Blunt, Ansel Elgort, David Harbour, and it's directed by Jon Watts.<br />(More Info About This Video Down Below!) <br /><br />Thumbnail Based On Amazing Artwork By Shamook<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/y4vrtzXaAec">https://youtu.be/y4vrtzXaAec</a><br />(Give them a follow for more!)<br /><br />Let us know what you think about it in the comments down below!<br /><br />We've got more cool stuff for you!

An Omega-level mutant with the ability to warp reality at will, Franklin has been a mainstay of Marvel’s comic book continuity since the late 1960s but has - thus far - yet to appear in any live-action adaptations. The MCU could introduce Franklin as a way to retroactively justify the Fantastic Four’s absence from the franchise, while also explaining why Marvel’s original superhero team is only being utilized now.<br /><br />In the real world, the Fantastic Four’s absence from the MCU is very easily explained. Like the X-Men and Deadpool, the Fantastic Four were previously owned by 20th Century Fox and were therefore out-of-bounds as far as Disney’s MCU was concerned. Disney’s acquisition of 20th Century Fox in 2017 means that these characters are now available and will be folded into the MCU over the coming years. Given that four non-MCU Fantastic Four films are already in existence, audiences are already aware of the characters and their origin story - allowing the family’s MCU debut to bypass a traditional introduction and factor into the wider universe more quickly, should Marvel and Disney choose to do so.<br /><br />Thank You So Much For Watching!<br />Stay Tuned!
