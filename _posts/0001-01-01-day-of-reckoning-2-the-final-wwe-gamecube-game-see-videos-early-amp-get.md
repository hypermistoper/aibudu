Featuring a Ruthless Aggression roster with superstars such as Kurt Angle, Chris Jericho, Triple H, Shawn Michaels, John Cena and Eddie Guerrero, the game is remebered fondly today as one of the unsung classics of WWE games. <br /><br />While most were busy playing the Smackdown and Smackdown vs Raw games on PS2, Gamecube owners were playing something totally different while getting their WWE fix. Things started off rocky with WrestleMania X8 and WrestleMania XIX on Gamecube, but the Day of Reckoning games were a great upgrade from these previous titles. Touted as a wrestling simulation experience as opposed to the fast-paced, quick action found in the Smackdown series, Day of Reckoning saw players approach wrestling matches differently with much higher focus on strategy. Story mode in Day of Reckoning 2 was a continuation from it's predecessor, so fans where able to take their original superstar even further in their WWE career while trying to solve the mystery of the stolen World Heavyweight Championship.<br /><br />While fans get ready for WWE 2K22, we'll take a look at WWE Day of Reckoning 2 in today's video. The roster, the gameplay, the story mode, and the comparisons to the N64 wrestling games are all covered.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />03:14 - Controls and Gameplay<br />07:01 - Presentation and Graphics<br />09:00 - Roster and match types<br />12:36 - Story Mode<br />16:17 - Comparisons to the Smackdown Series<br />19:27 - Credits<br /><br />#WWE #RetroGaming #Wrestling{% endraw %}
