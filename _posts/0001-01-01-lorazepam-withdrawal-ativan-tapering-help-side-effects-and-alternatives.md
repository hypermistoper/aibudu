What is Lorazepam (Ativan)? Lorazepam is a rapid-acting short half-life benzodiazepine used for anxiety, seizure control, acute alcohol withdrawal, and sometimes sleep. <br /><br />2. Is Lorazepam Addictive?   According to the DEA, Lorazepam has a low potential for abuse as a schedule IV drug.  We find this dangerously misleading and consider Ativan addiction and withdrawal to be even at times life-threatening. <br /><br />3.  What is interdosing Withdrawal?   Because Ativan is a short half-life drug, a person can go into withdrawal if they are taking it only one time per day. <br /><br />To read more about Lorazepam (Ativan) Withdrawal visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.alternativetomeds.com/benzodiazepine/lorazepam/">https://www.alternativetomeds.com/benzodiazepine/lorazepam/</a><br /><br />4.
