{% raw %}The COVID-19 pandemic has made it more challenging than ever to feel prepared, hopeful, and equipped to face the future with optimism. How do we map out our lives when it feels impossible to predict what the world will be like next week, let alone next year or next decade? What we need now are strategies to help us recover our confidence and creativity in facing uncertain futures IFTF Research Director Leah Zaidi talks to Dr. Jane McGonigal, IFTF Director of Game Research + Development, about her inspiring new book Imaginable, which draws on the latest scientific research in psychology and neuroscience to show us how to train our minds to think the unthinkable and imagine the unimaginable. Jane invites you to come learn how we can build our collective imagination, develop the vision to solve problems creatively, take actions that will shape the future we desire, and access “urgent optimism,” an unstoppable force within each of us that activates our sense of agency.<br /><br />Aired: Wednesday, March 2, 2022.<br /><br />IFTF Foresight Talks webinars host leading-edge foresight practitioners in practical, inspiring conversations about how and why they do their work. Join us to hear insights and reflections on the evolving futures landscape - and to ask your own questions directly in a Q&amp;A session. These talks are free, open to all, and ideal for graduates of the IFTF Foresight Essentials training. Each session lasts one hour, includes a period for questions from the audience, and is archived below one week after its airing. Foresight Talks occur monthly.<br /><br />Learn more at www.iftf.org/foresightessentials  and <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.iftf.org/imaginable">https://www.iftf.org/imaginable</a> <br />© 2022 Institute for the Future{% endraw %}
