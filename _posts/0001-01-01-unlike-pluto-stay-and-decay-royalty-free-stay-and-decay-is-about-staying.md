{% raw %}Stay and Decay is about staying on your path so you can reach your full potential. I set the scene in a surreal forest with things like red doors &amp; white horses trying to distract you, throwing you off your path. If you let the distractions consume you, you'll never move on to &quot;Nirvana, Shangri-La, or Valhalla&quot;. I was inspired to write this song because I am constantly reminding myself to stay on my path, the amount of content I put out is very demanding, but I know it will all be worth it (:<br /><br />ðŸŽ§<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fanlink.to/unlikepluto">https://fanlink.to/unlikepluto</a><br />Merch - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unlikepluto.merchtable.com/">https://unlikepluto.merchtable.com/</a><br /><br /><br />LYRICS: <br /><br />You were on the right track<br />You were on the right path<br />Black door in the forest<br />Is it here to taunt us?  Cuz itâ€™s goin nowhere<br /><br />You gotta move on, cuz shadows in the dark<br />Are always coming toward, you<br />Red eyes in the night, you put em out of sight<br />Donâ€™t be paralyzed, move on to<br /><br />Nirvana, Shangri-La, or valhalla<br />Move, cuz if you stay in limbo youâ€™ll decay<br /><br />Roots, trees, branches, leaves<br />Covering the skyline, blocking off the sunlight, making noon like midnight<br />White horse on the right, calls you to the light<br />Put it out sight, you<br /><br />Need to try and see, the forest from the trees<br />Donâ€™t be paralyzed, move on to<br /><br />Nirvana, Shangri-La, or valhalla<br />Move, cuz if you stay in limbo youâ€™ll decay<br /><br />Maybe no one really knows the way<br />(No one really knows, the way)<br />Broken clocks are right twice a day<br />No phone booths, life lines, not today<br />(No one really offers help anyway)<br />No ones there to save you from this place<br /><br />Nirvana, Shangri-La, or valhalla<br />Move, cuz if you stay in limbo youâ€™ll decay<br /><br />#royaltyfree #unlikepluto #alternative{% endraw %}
