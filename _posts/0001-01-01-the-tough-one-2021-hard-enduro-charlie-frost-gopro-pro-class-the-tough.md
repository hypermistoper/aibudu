{% raw %}The Tough One 2021 witnessed a unique racing moment with FIM World Hard Enduro Champion Billy Bolt and David Knight MBE lined up for the trophy at the Nantmawr Quarry - United Kingdom.<br /><br />Charlie Frost was kind enough to wear our GoPro to get you this excellent racing content to enjoy. Unlike his normal 300 2T bike setup he had to borrow his brother’s 350 4T and that had an effect for sure. Charlie came in P6 in the end and this is his second lap into the race.<br /><br />Charlie’s Post race comment; <br />“Unfortunately, I am without a Gas Gas at the moment due to unavailability of them so borrowed my brothers 350 4T for the Tough One- obviously not the desired choice of weapon for the event but better than nothing. It wasn’t the easiest of bikes to try and man handle around the course- with it being a 4 stroke it wanted to stall on the technical sections which made life hard for me, but I struggled on for a 6th place Pro class finish. Wasn’t my finest riding and felt capable of a higher position finishing but the bike held me back. Never the less it was a fun atmosphere and a great race thanks to Steve Ireland and the WOR Events team.”<br /><br />After 2h battle in and around the quarry Billy Bolt claimed the victory although he had to enter the race with a sore arm left from recent injury he had. Former FIM World Enduro GP champion David Knight got the P2 and young appearance Mitch Brightmore P3.<br /><br />00:00 - Lap 1<br />10:44 - Lap 2<br /><br />Don't forget Subscribe, Comment and Like.<br /><br />✦ Subscribe for MORE:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2RfrRzC">http://bit.ly/2RfrRzC</a><br />✦ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2RFANxH">http://bit.ly/2RFANxH</a><br />✦ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3KkEd1B">https://bit.ly/3KkEd1B</a><br />✦ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2TGoTkG">http://bit.ly/2TGoTkG</a><br /><br />#hardenduro #toughone #dirtbike{% endraw %}
