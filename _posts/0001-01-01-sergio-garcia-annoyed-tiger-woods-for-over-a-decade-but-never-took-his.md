{% raw %}Sergio Garcia once seemed like he might be a legitimate rival to Tiger Woods, like he might actually snatch a title or two off golf's biggest superstar. It didn't happen that way, and the more Sergio fell short, the more irritated ... and irritating ... he got. This beef included a lot of whining, some fun final rounds of golf, and one very spicy Tweety Bird reference, but then Garcia took it way too far.<br /><br />Directed and edited by Charlotte Atkinson<br />Written and produced by Seth Rosenthal<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/Nbabae">http://goo.gl/Nbabae</a> <br />Enter the Secret Base: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sbnation.com/secret-base">http://www.sbnation.com/secret-base</a> <br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/secretbase">https://twitter.com/secretbase</a> <br />Follow us on Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/secretbasesbn">https://www.twitch.tv/secretbasesbn</a> <br />Follow us on Tiktok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@secretbasesbn?">https://www.tiktok.com/@secretbasesbn?</a> <br />Check out our full video catalog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/9pMHRV">http://goo.gl/9pMHRV</a> <br />Visit our playlists: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/NvpZFF">http://goo.gl/NvpZFF</a> <br />Explore SB Nation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sbnation.com">http://www.sbnation.com</a>{% endraw %}
