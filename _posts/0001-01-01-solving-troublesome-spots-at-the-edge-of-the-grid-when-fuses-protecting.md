{% raw %}When fuses protecting overhead distribution transformers operate, 70% of the time they’re for nuisance outages requiring no other repair work, meaning wasted maintenance costs for avoidable permanent outages. Often, these issues cluster into pockets, resulting in troublesome spots on the grid and customers experiencing repeat outages. The VacuFuse® II Self-Resetting Interrupter brings fault-testing technology to the edge of the grid to automatically bring power back on once the temporary cause of an outage, such as a broken tree branch, has cleared the lines. Designed to provide utilities with advanced end-to-end lateral protection for their most vulnerable customers, the VacuFuse II interrupter improves customer satisfaction and reduces O&amp;M expenses.
