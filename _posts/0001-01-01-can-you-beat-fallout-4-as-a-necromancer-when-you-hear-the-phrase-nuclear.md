{% raw %}When you hear the phrase “nuclear armageddon” the first word that pops into your head should be: friendship. The apocalypse offers opportunities to bond with people you never knew existed and creatures you wished didn’t. Unfortunately, not all friends out in the wasteland are built to last. But with the power of mods we can resurrect fallen friends and force them to accompany us on our journey until time itself reaches its natural conclusion.

(in text form)<br /><br />The rules are dead simple: I can’t attack anything directly, only corpses I’ve reanimated and rigged with string to act as my companions can attack on my behalf. This is accomplished with a combination of modding and console commands. The ‘mod name here’ mod allows you to have an infinite number of companions while also letting you claim any NPC or wasteland creature as your new friend. To bring the fighting spirit back to dead bodies, I use the resurrect console command to bring them. Unfortunately there are some glitches here and there, I installed a few mods to add extra beasts into the wilderness. In the interest of full frontal disclosure, I did go a little too far. UFOs are one thing, but I draw the line at dolphins with guns. Nobody’s evolving under my watch.  <br /><br />Regarding character creation and the finer points of attractiveness, I had in my mind the image of the perfect father. I’m talking of course about Nigel Thornsberry, father of the daughter who can talk to animals in the cartoon. That’s not this video but I used my last good name joke when I named myself NecroMandy in the New Vegas Necromancer video. SPECIAL stats: gotta have Luck of 5 for the idiot Savant. Intelligence all the way down compliments that perk by increasing the likelihood of getting 3x XP any time XP is rewarded. No tricks to gain XP, no magic to power level myself, I’m not a magician. I’m a circus. <br /><br />Shaun daydreamed about the Great Beyond, the Great War began, I looked great in the Vault Jumpsuit and I emerged from the freezer ready to take the world by storm. For my first act of resuscitation, I chose my recently deceased wife as the target. Fallout 4 runs on a more advanced version of the Creation Engine than Fallout New Vegas did. As a result, mods, console commands, and the game as a whole operates differently. Targets that have never been alive can’t be resurrected. Sometimes you walk into a building and there’s a dead bootable body on the floor. That character was never alive so you can’t use them like a puppet. Nora isn’t really an example of that. She’s single and ready to mingle between dimensions. She woke up, took a step out of the cooler, stepped back inside and succumbed to Lock-In Syndrome once again. She’ll be fine. There are roaches here I can waste 10 minutes trying to lure into an electrical trap to kill them since, as a Necromancer, I can’t attack them myself. Killing them with sparkles is a game of chance, all you can do is stand around absorbing blows hoping a lightning strike slams into one of the roaches. Then, after they all die and you get the Pip-Boy, you go back to claim your prize and they’ve all de-spawned because this is a Bethesda game. The void ate my babies.{% endraw %}
