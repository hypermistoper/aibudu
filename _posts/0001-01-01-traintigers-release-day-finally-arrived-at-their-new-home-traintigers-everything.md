{% raw %}#TrainTigers 🐯🐯🇦🇷🐯🐯: 'Everything is going to be fine in the end. If it's not fine, it's not the end!' (Oscar Wilde) <br />After a journey of over 70 hours, the four tigers arrived at our LIONSROCK Big Cat Sanctuary and our team was relieved to see how well they have managed this long trip. ✈️ <br /><br />Take a look at the special first moments of the big cats stepping onto the grass in South Africa and watch them bravely explore their new home. We are so proud of Messi, Sandro, Mafalda, and Gustavo – words can’t describe the emotions we all feel after this successful rescue mission! 💚 <br />➡️ Get your tissues ready for some tears while watching this and stay tuned for more updates on the tigers soon... <br /><br /><br />Follow us:  <br />Facebook ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.four-paws.org/facebook">https://www.four-paws.org/facebook</a><br />Twitter ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.four-paws.org/twitter">https://www.four-paws.org/twitter</a><br />Instagram ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.four-paws.org/instagram">https://www.four-paws.org/instagram</a><br />Pinterest ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.four-paws.org/pinterest">https://www.four-paws.org/pinterest</a><br />LinkedIn ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.four-paws.org/linkedin">https://www.four-paws.org/linkedin</a><br />TikTok➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fourpawsinternational">https://www.tiktok.com/@fourpawsinternational</a> <br /><br />Don't forget to subscribe to this channel to be informed when we upload a new video!
