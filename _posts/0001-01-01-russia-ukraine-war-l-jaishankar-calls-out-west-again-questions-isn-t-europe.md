{% raw %}External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar’s remarks at GLOBSEC 2022 Bratislava Forum have gone viral. The minister has been praised earlier too for his articulate and assertive replies regarding India’s position on various matters of foreign policy. In the course of defending India’s stance on Ukraine war, Jaishankar says: “Europe has to get out of the mindset that Europe’s problems are the world’s problems, but the world’s problems are not Europe’s problems.&quot;<br />When the moderator asks him who India will side with - US or China - in case it has to pick a side, the minister added: “I don’t accept that India has to join either the US axis or China axis. We are one-fifth of the world’s population, fifth or sixth largest economy in the world…we are entitled to weigh our own side.&quot;<br />#jaishankar #europe #getclosertothenews <br /><br />0:00 INTRODUCTION<br />0:38 “DOES ONLY INDIAN MONEY FUND THE WAR?”<br />1:43 “WHY DON’T THEY ALLOW IRANIAN, VENEZUELAN OIL?”<br />2:09 JAISHANKAR SLAMS EUROPE’S ‘DOUBLE STANDARDS’<br />4:00 'INDIA ‘PERFECTLY CAPABLE’ OF MANAGING ITS TIES WITH CHINA'<br />4:50 “INDIA ENTITLED TO MAKE ITS OWN CHOICES”<br />5:59 WHY DOESN’T INDIA EXPORT WHEAT TO EASE GLOBAL FOOD PRICES?<br /> <br />CRUX is your daily video news guide to the big events that are shaping our world.
