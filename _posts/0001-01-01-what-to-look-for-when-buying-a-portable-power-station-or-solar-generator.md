They are large battery packs that change DC to AC power and also output DC.  While they are all the same, they are all so very different.  First, the less expensive models mostly use Lithium-Ion batteries that can be charged around 500 times.  The better units use a Lithium Iron Phosphate battery that can be charged around 2,000 times.<br /><br />Beyond that, each unit will vary on voltage and the ability to output X amount of watts.  Some will push the Peak Watts they can output, but the number you need to watch is the constant watt output.<br /><br />Many of the units have different displays that will allow you to see watts and watts out of the unit.  That helps a lot to keep you safe from overloads and to help keep your voltage more constant.<br /><br />What no one advertises is the ability for the machine to turn off when overloaded.  We are now finding many inexpensive units on the market that will not turn off when overloaded.  This will cause a voltage drop and can cause significant damage to anything plugged into it.<br /><br />Do your research and find out what unit will work well for you!{% endraw %}
