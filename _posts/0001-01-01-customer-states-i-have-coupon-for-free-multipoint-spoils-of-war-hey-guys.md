{% raw %}Hey guys, today customer came in with a coupon for a free multipoint inspection. Say No More! 2011 Toyota Avalon that drives nice, flavor is present but not that bad. It's a good thing this customer came in because CSW found the lower tank to the radiator leaking and rear brakes at 2mm. There is also a SPOILS OF WAR moment that completed something for CSW. Enjoy! Also we have an update on a previous vehicle with a Googats ECU!{% endraw %}
