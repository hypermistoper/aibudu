{% raw %}My fiancé will be graduating soon. I’ve been the sole income earner the entire time she’s been in school. It’s actually been really shitty, I don’t make a ton of money so we haven’t been able to do anything fun for a long time now considering I’m squirreling away all extra money for our future wedding.<br /><br />Over the weekend she brought up taking a vacation after her graduation to celebrate. I told her there’s no way my boss would give me the time off and we can’t afford it even if he could. She said I could at least try and if I couldn’t then she could go with her sister. That she deserves some time to recharge before jumping into the work force because who knows how long it’ll be before she could take time like that for herself. As far as paying for it, she wants to dip into our wedding savings.<br /><br /><br /><br />#AITA #RedditUpdate <br /><br />Reddit aita. justnomil reddit. r/aita update. reddit update. justnoso reddit. aita. reddit husband. reddit stories. justnoso reddit. reddit update. r/ relationships. r/ AITA. r/aita.  r/ Relationship_Advice. r/justnomil. rslash.<br /><br /><br /><br />Chapters<br /><br />00:00 Intro<br />00:10 Story 1<br />01:52 My opinion<br />02:11 Story 1 comments<br />03:29 Story 2<br />06:46 Story 2 comments<br />07:50 Story 3<br />09:28 My opinion<br />09:52 Story 3 comments <br />10:54 Story 4<br />14:07 Story 4 comments<br /><br /><br />Stories<br /><br /><br /><br />1.
