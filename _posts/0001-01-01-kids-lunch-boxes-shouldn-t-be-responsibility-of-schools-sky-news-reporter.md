{% raw %}Sky News reporter Caroline Marcus says what kids are consuming at school shouldn’t be the “responsibility” of schools. <br /><br />“Parents shouldn’t be sending lunch boxes full of junk food for their kids,” Ms Marcus said. <br /><br />“But on the other hand, we shouldn’t be completely transferring the responsibility of what kids’ nutritional needs are onto schools. <br /><br />“That should be something that is up to parents.”{% endraw %}
