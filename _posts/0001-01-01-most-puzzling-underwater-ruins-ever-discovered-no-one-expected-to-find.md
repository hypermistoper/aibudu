{% raw %}These submerged ruins have completely changed how we view the ancient world due to their age and the depth at which they were discovered. Right up until they were found no one even believed they could exist. Huge megaliths, massive human made bridges, and the strangest of all...an underwater pyramid city has all been found under the ocean waves. Are they remnants of a pre-ice age civilization, one that became lost to the sands of time?<br /><br />0:00:13 The Azores<br />0:13:47 Ruins off the Coast of Cuba<br />0:27:56 The Gulf of Cambay<br />0:40:12 The Yonaguni Monument <br />0:54:23 Rama's Bridge in India<br />1:07:04 Bimini Road{% endraw %}
