{% raw %}How to Invest During Inflationary Times according to Peter Lynch<br />The annual inflation rate in the United States has jumped yet again, to 7% per year. <br /><br />Because of this inflation, we know that Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve are planning three interest rate hikes this year. <br /><br />Basically, they want to stifle the economy and slow business, but boosting interest rates has the consequence of making businesses and stock markets less appealing. Super safe government bonds, on the other hand, begin to look more appealing. And while a high-interest rate environment does not necessarily indicate the stock market will fall, it does place a lot more pressure on the stock market than a low-interest rate.<br /><br />In this video, we will get to know Peter Lynch, an American investor, and his advice on how to invest in times of inflation. <br /><br />Donâ€™t forget to subscribe and hit the notification bell!
