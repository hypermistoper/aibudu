Note that some of the links are just similar items due to availability (many of my clothes are older), and that some of them are adlinks which means I might be working on an affiliate-based term with the brand/website. Therefore I may receive a small percentage in commission if a purchase is being made. If you choose to use these links, thank you for your support! :-)<br /><br />Also note that I go out of my way to find eco-friendly alternatives - either straight from an eco-brand or from a brand that is improving qualities (organic cotton, recycled polyester etc.).<br /><br /> Pls. read my disclaimer for products linked and more transparency: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.uselesswardrobe.dk/disclaimer/">http://www.uselesswardrobe.dk/disclaimer/</a><br /><br />► Music credit: Epidemicsound.com (Youtube creator song library)<br /><br />—————<br /><br />#workwear #capsulewardrobe #smartcasual{% endraw %}
