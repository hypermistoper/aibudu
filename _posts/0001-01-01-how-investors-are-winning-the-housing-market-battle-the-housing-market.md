{% raw %}The housing market relies on many things: market sentiment, Federal Reserve policy, supply, demand, interest rates, inflation‚Äîthe list goes on and on. For most homebuyers, it may seem almost impossible to crack the code of when (or if) it makes sense to buy a home or rental property. But, as we‚Äôre seeing housing market turbulence, we‚Äôre also seeing investor activity skyrocket. What do experienced investors know that we don‚Äôt?<br /><br />Joining us for the first episode of On The Market is VP of Data and Analytics at BiggerPockets, Dave Meyer, real estate investing expert Henry Washington, builder, buyer, and landlord, Kathy Fettke, home flipping extraordinaire James Dainard, and arguably the biggest (and best) wholesaler in the United States, Jamil Damji. <br /><br />This week‚Äôs episode focuses on 2022 housing market predictions, where each guest gives their take on where the housing market may end up at the closing of this year. We also touch on how to invest in 2022, updating your investing strategy, whether to wait or invest, and the double-edged sword of debt that can make you rich, or sink your ship. <br /><br />~~~~<br />Join BiggerPockets for FREE üëá<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/signup?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/signup?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a>   <br />~~~~<br />Listen to The ‚ÄúOn The Market‚Äù Podcast Wherever You Listen to Podcasts:<br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2NlzZ9NtHtZ2uBuaDNoGzY">https://open.spotify.com/show/2NlzZ9NtHtZ2uBuaDNoGzY</a> <br />Apple Podcasts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/on-the-market/id1615086704">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/on-the-market/id1615086704</a> <br />BiggerPockets: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/podcasts?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/podcasts?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />~~~~<br />Join the Future of Real Estate Investing with Fundrise:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fundrise.com/biggerpockets">https://www.fundrise.com/biggerpockets</a> <br />~~~~<br />Will Rising Interest Rates Tank the Housing Market?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/will-rising-interest-rates-tank-the-housing-market?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/will-rising-interest-rates-tank-the-housing-market?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />~~~~<br />What Every Investor Should Understand About Inflation: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/investor-understand-inflation?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/investor-understand-inflation?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />~~~~<br />Grab This Week‚Äôs Data Drop:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/datadrop?">https://www.biggerpockets.com/datadrop?</a><br />utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none <br />~~~~<br />Connect with Dave and Our Panel of Guests:<br />Dave Meyer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/davem27?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/davem27?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />Henry Washington: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/henryw22?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/henryw22?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />James Dainard: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/heaton?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/heaton?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />Jamil Damji: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/jamild6?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/jamild6?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />Kathy Fettke: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/kfettke?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/kfettke?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />~~~~<br />Follow Dave and BiggerPockets on Instagram: <br />Dave: @thedatadeli or <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thedatadeli/">https://www.instagram.com/thedatadeli/</a> <br />BiggerPockets: @biggerpockets or <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/biggerpockets/">https://www.instagram.com/biggerpockets/</a> <br /><br />Episode 1<br /><br />Show notes at: biggerpockets.com/blog/on-the-market-2?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none<br /><br />0:00 Welcome to On The Market!<br />2:03 Between the Headlines: 2022 Housing Market Predictions<br />4:53 Rent Prices<br />8:05 Home Prices<br />14:02 Inflation<br />20:42 Dave's Crystal (Bingo) Ball<br />22:17 Due Diligence: How to Invest in 2022<br />39:09 The Double-Edged Sword of Debt<br />44:51 The Effects of Rising Interest Rates<br />47:13 Should Investors Wait?<br />51:18 The Economy's Impact on Housing<br />53:50 Crowd Source{% endraw %}
