{% raw %}The Ill-Mo Boys – Geoff Seitz on fiddle and vocals, Curtis Buckhannon on mandolin and vocals, and Jim Nelson on guitar and vocals – officially got together in summer of 1985 and played their distinctive brand of old-time country music for square dances and concerts at festivals, clubs, and music camps coast to coast across the country for 20 years. Just a few of the festivals and smaller venues at which they have performed – Indiana Fiddlers Gathering (Battleground, IN), Wanna Dance Uptown (Seattle, WA), Minnesota Bluegrass and Old-Time Music Festival (Zimmerman, MN), Hiawatha Traditional Music Festival (Marquette, MI), Wheatland Traditional Music Festival (Remus, MI), Augusta Heritage Center (Elkins, WV), and Arrow Rock Folk Festival (Arrow Rock, MO) David Adler Cultural Center (Libertyville, IL), Missouri History Museum (St. Louis, MO), Focal Point (Maplewood, MO).<br /><br />The band’s instrumentation – fiddle, mandolin, and guitar – gives it a sound that is somewhat unique among contemporary old-time string bands and allows a lot of room for musical maneuvering. As their name indicates, the Ill-Mo Boys gathered much of their material in the surrounding region, though they never felt particularly limited by either geographic or musical boundaries. In addition to the Missouri fiddle tunes that have won Geoff Seitz many a prize in fiddle contests across the country, the Ill-Mos play mandolin rags, blues, and early country songs learned from old recordings and old friends. This will be an evening of good times and good music.{% endraw %}
