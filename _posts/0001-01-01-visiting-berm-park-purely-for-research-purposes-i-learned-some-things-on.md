{% raw %}On Monday, I spent the entire day at Berm Park. Oddly enough, this is the first time I've done this since grand opening without a thousand people there, or construction taking place.  This was also on a day that fellow YouTuber, Jeff Kendall-Weed was visiting, so I got to ride with a friend!<br /><br />Riding the bike park like a normal visitor gave me a lot of interesting insight, like the need for additional signs. I also realized that a lot of people who come to Berm Park are still learning what a bike park actually is, and what it's for. <br /><br />As I said in the video, we're counting on you guys to explain (nicely) what the rules of the bike park are. We have one-way signs there, but I saw an entire youth ministry led by an adult riding backwards up High Roller. People don't always read, and clearly this whole closed loop bike park concept is new to them. But just like you, they're visiting to have fun. Let's make sure everyone has fun safely!<br /><br />Jeff Kendall-Weed's YouTube Channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffKendallWeed/videos">https://www.youtube.com/c/JeffKendallWeed/videos</a><br /><br />Berm Peak Hoodies, Beanies, Jerseys, Shirts<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection">https://cognativemtb.com/collections/seths-bike-hacks-collection</a><br /><br />Check out our second channel for &quot;express&quot; videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOpP5PqrzODWpFU961acUbg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOpP5PqrzODWpFU961acUbg</a><br /><br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sethsbikehacks">https://www.instagram.com/sethsbikehacks</a><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/sethsbikehacks">https://www.facebook.com/sethsbikehacks</a><br /><br />Music in this video is from <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/trQSg">http://share.epidemicsound.com/trQSg</a><br />and <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundstripe.com?fpr=seth20">https://soundstripe.com?fpr=seth20</a><br /><br />Support Berm Park!
