{% raw %}NEW! 'AD INFINITUM' POSTER, TEE AND SWEATSHIRT NOW AVAILABLE AT <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/StupendiumMerch">https://bit.ly/StupendiumMerch</a> !<br /><br />HEY EVERY   ! ARE YOU READY FOR [[Feature Presentation]]!?!?!<br /><br />In Toby Fox's Deltarune Chapter 2, the follow up to 2015's Undertale, your quest through Cyber City introduces you to many colourful characters, not least of which is Spamton G. Spamton the salesman. Formed from an amalgam of junk email, online adverts and adware and with a grip on reality about as strong as his grip on grammar and syntax, Spamton has fallen on hard times when you find him in his garbage can home. Maybe you can get him one last sale and become a BIG SHOT just like him..?<br /><br />Okay, so this one was obviously going to happen, wasn't it? With my seemingly unerring trend of making songs about crazy and/or evil businessmen. I think we all knew this was coming, right?<br /><br />This was a very interesting project to write. If you've followed my work for any length of time you'll hopefully know that one thing I strive for in all of my character pieces is accuracy and authenticity in the lyrics and performance. So how does one write a song to be sung by a character who struggles with complete sentences? The answer? Throw all the lyrical rules out the window and go a little bit insane. Has it paid off? I don't know! I hope so.<br /><br />I also really wanted to push for music that sounded straight from Deltarune. This song has Spamton's words coming at you hard and unrelenting as if they were attacks in a battle and I wanted the music to reflect that. Credit to oo oxygen for composing the synthesized insanity going on in this song.<br /><br />Also, the musical-theatre aficionados among you MAY recognise some references to a particular 1957 musical. 'The Music Man' is a show all about a musical conman/salesman and I just couldn't resist working in some (pretty on the nose) ((and it IS a big nose)) references to some of its songs.<br /><br />Does all of this result in a good song? Good question! If nothing else, it's certainly an experience and I'm proud of how true to Spamton I think it feels.<br /><br />And before anyone, perhaps unfamiliar with Spamton, asks: yes we DID spellcheck this video... Then we went through and added all of the mistakes. ðŸ˜‰<br /><br />A HUGE thank you to CosFia for her work on the makeup for this video. It was the most intensive makeup I've ever used (over 3 hours to apply!) and the first time I've hired a dedicated makeup artist for a shoot. Thank you also to the folks of Patreon for making that and everything else in this video possible!<br /><br />#deltarune #spamton<br />-----<br />Check out the full Stupendium originals playlist for all of my original songs!<br />STUPENDIUM ORIGINALS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVVOXbE6Ls1glsfzH9tldq-KqPI-g84LA">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVVOXbE6Ls1glsfzH9tldq-KqPI-g84LA</a><br /><br />THE STUPENDIUM ON SPOTIFY:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Stupendify">http://bit.ly/Stupendify</a><br /><br />THE STUPENDIUM ON iTUNES:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/StupendiTunes">http://bit.ly/StupendiTunes</a><br /><br />Lyrics and vocals by The Stupendium <br />Song produced by @oo oxygen <br />Video by The Stupendium &amp; Lizzy CJ<br />Makeup by CosFia: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/fia_cosplay/">https://www.instagram.com/fia_cosplay/</a><br /><br />Deltarune, its world and characters are property of Toby Fox!<br />-----<br />You can support The Stupendium on Patreon!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thestupendium">https://www.patreon.com/thestupendium</a><br /><br />Grab your official Stupendium Merchandise!
