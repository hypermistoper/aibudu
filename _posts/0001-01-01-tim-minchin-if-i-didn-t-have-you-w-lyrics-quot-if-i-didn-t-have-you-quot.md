{% raw %}&quot;If I Didn't Have You&quot; by Tim Minchin.<br />All rights to Tim Minchin<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Yeah, yeah<br />If I didn't have you<br /><br />If I didn't have you to hold me tight<br />(If I didn't have you)<br />If I didn't have you to lie with at night<br />(When I'm feeling blue)<br />If I didn't have you to share my sighs<br />(Share my sighs)<br />And to kiss me and dry my tears when I cry<br /><br />Well I really think that I would... <br />Have somebody else<br /><br />(If I didn't have you)<br />If I didn't have you, someone else would do<br /><br />Your love is one in a million<br />(One in a million)<br />You couldn't buy it at any price<br />(Can't buy love)<br />But of the 9.999 hundred thousand other loves<br />Statistically, some of them would be equally nice<br />(Equally nice)<br />Or maybe not as nice but, say, smarter than you<br />Or dumber but better at sport or tracing<br />I'm just saying<br />(I really think that I would)<br />Probably<br />(Have somebody else)<br /><br />Yeah<br /><br />(If I didn't have you)<br />If I didn't have you someone else would do<br />(Someone else would surely do)<br /><br />If I were a rich man<br />Diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-diddle-ee<br />I guess I would be with a surgeon or a model<br />Or a rellie of the Royals or a Kennedy<br />Or a nymphomaniacal exhibitionist heiress to a large chain of hotels<br />If I were a rich man, maybe I would fiddle<br />Fiddle-diddle-diddle with the rich man girls<br /><br />I'm not saying that I'd not love you if I was wealthy or handsome<br />But realistically there's lots of fish in the sea<br />And if I had a different rod I would concievably land some<br />Even though I am fiscally consistantly pitiable<br />And considerably less Brad Pitt than Brad Pitiful<br />Am I really so poor and ugly that you reckon only you could possibly love me?<br />And I<br />(Really think that I would)<br />Probably<br />(Have somebody else)<br /><br />(If I didn't have you)<br />If I didn't have you, someone else would do<br />(Someone else would surely do)<br /><br />And look, I'm not undervaluing what we've got when I say<br />That given the role chaos inevitably plays in the inherently flawed notion of &quot;fate&quot;<br />It's obtuse to deduce that I've found my soulmate at the age of seventeen<br />It's just mathematically unlikely that at a university in Perth<br />I happened to stumble on the one girl on Earth specifically designed for me<br /><br />And if I may conjecture a further objection, love is nothing to do with destined perfection<br />The connection is strengthened, the affection simply grows over time<br />Like a flower<br />Or a mushroom<br />Or a guinea pig<br />Or a vine<br />Or a sponge<br />Or bigotry<br />... or a banana<br /><br />And love is made more powerful by the ongoing drama of shared experience<br />And the synergy of a kind of symbiotic empathy or... something<br /><br />So I trust it would go without saying<br />That I would feel really very sad<br />If tomorrow you were to fall off something high<br />Or catch something bad<br />But I'm just saying<br />I don't think you're special<br />I-I mean, I think your special<br />But you fall within a bell curve<br />I mean, I'm just saying I<br />(Really think that I would)<br />Probably<br />(Have somebody else)<br /><br />I think you are unique and beautiful<br />(Unique and beaut)<br />You make me happy just by being around<br />(Being around)<br />But objectively, you would have to agree that baby when I found you<br />Options were relatively thin on the ground<br />(Thin on the ground)<br />You're lovely but there must be girls as lovely as you<br />And maybe more open to spanking or table tennis<br />I'm just saying<br />(Really think that I would)<br />Probably<br />(Have somebody else)<br /><br />I mean I reckon it's pretty likely that if, for example<br />My first girlfriend, Jackie, hadn't dumped me<br />After I kissed Winston's ex-girlfriend Neah at Steph's party back in 1993<br />Enough variables would probably have been altered by the absence of that event<br />To have meant the advent of a tangential narrative in which we don't meet<br />Which is to say there exists a theoretical hypothetical parallel life<br />Where what is is not as it is and I am not your husband and you are not my wife<br /><br />And I am a stuntman living in LA<br />Married to a small, blonde Portuguese skier<br />Who, when she's not training<br />Does abstract painting<br />Practices yoga<br />And brews her own beer<br />And really like making home movies<br />And suffers neck down alopecia<br /><br />But with all my heart and all my mind, I know one thing is true<br />I have just one life and just one love and, my love, that love is you<br />And if it wasn't for you, darling you<br /><br />(Really think that I would)<br />Probably<br />(Have somebody else)<br /><br />(If I didn't have you)<br />If I didn't have you someone else would surely do{% endraw %}
