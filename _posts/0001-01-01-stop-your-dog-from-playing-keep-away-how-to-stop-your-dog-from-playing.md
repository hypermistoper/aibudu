{% raw %}How to stop your dog from playing keep away. Experiencing your dog running away from you and not letting you catch them can be extremely frustrating. This video shows you one technique to incorporate into your training so your dog stops playing keep away from you.<br />Why dogs play keep away<br />Dogs play keep away for two main reasons.<br />1) They simply enjoy it and you have accidently taught them that this is a fun game. This is often the product of chasing your dog for fun.<br />2) They think that when they are caught, something bad will happen. This could be many different things and will be unique to the individual dog. Most of the time, they have learned that when you catch them, the fun always ends. This could be leaving a dog park, going inside from outside and then crated, taking something away from them such as a toy or stick. Lots of possible reasons here.<br />Tips:<br />1) Teach your dog that you catching them is a good thing. Practice grabbing their collar and feeding or grabbing their collar and play fetch or tug. Show them that grabbing their collar does not always mean that you are going to take them away from something<br />2) Donâ€™t give your dog a lecture when you catch them.<br />3) Begin training your dog to come to you when you call them. Incorporate collar grabs during the recall training. <br /><br />Want to Work With Me?<br />I offer an online training program at MyDogTrainingSpot.com<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mydogtrainingspot.com/">https://www.mydogtrainingspot.com/</a> <br /><br />If you would like me to work with You &amp; Your Dog, contact me at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.evergreenschoolfordogs.com/">http://www.evergreenschoolfordogs.com/</a> <br /><br />You can find me on facebook at: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/evergreenschoolfordogs">https://www.facebook.com/evergreenschoolfordogs</a>  <br /><br />Thanks for Watching!
