From your water to your wallpaper, death lurked around every corner. Public health was such a problem that male tradesmen and laborers of the working class had life expectancies of 25 and 22 respectively. But no worries, if you do ever happen to find yourself in the unfortunate cesspool that is Victorian London, I'm here to teach you all the essentials you'll need to know to survive!<br /><br />Mike Dash's article on Two Penny Hangovers: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mikedashhistory.com/2021/05/19/the-twopenny-hangover/">https://mikedashhistory.com/2021/05/19/the-twopenny-hangover/</a><br /><br />NOTES:<br /><br />My comment on corsets being dangerous wasn't meant to be a blanket statement for all corset use. While certainly not always dangerous, when the practice was taken to the extremes (aka tight lacing), permanent ribcage and organ deformation could occur (which is the picture I showed in the video). There are skeletons in museums showing the results: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/library-and-publications/library/blog/effects-of-the-corset/">https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/library-and-publications/library/blog/effects-of-the-corset/</a><br /><br />I've also been getting a lot of comments on the life expectancies of 25 and 22 being misleading because it includes childhood mortality. It's actually not misleading at all. All I did was a balance of probability. If you are older than the life expectancy of one group, then you would statistically be more likely to be dead at that point in time than you would for the other group with a higher life expectancy. It's basic statistics. Infants are still a part of the equation and you have to account for them because if you were to roll the dice to see if you'd be alive at the age of 26 for example, infant mortalities would affect that outcome. <br /><br />Also: Some people are mishearing my line at 6:18, I'm not saying mummies had brains, the line was, &quot;oh my god, look, he's got no brain, that's crazy.&quot;{% endraw %}
