J&amp;Mchannel<br /><br />💥🍊 The benefits of orange juice.<br /><br /> Its fiber content facilitates intestinal transit: Improves and facilitates your digestion thanks to the presence of citric acids.  Regulates and stabilizes the functions of your organs (bowels): Against diarrhea and constipation.  Solves your biliary insufficiencies.<br /><br /> Its flesh also contains many other nutrients, in addition to calcium, it is rich in potassium, phosphorus, magnesium and even fiber.  This makes it a very good food to consume regularly.<br /><br /> Consuming fresh orange juice every morning also helps lower the level of bad cholesterol in the blood while significantly increasing, conversely, that of good cholesterol.<br /><br /> Every day, it is therefore recommended to drink between 1.5 and 2 liters.  Drinking a glass of orange juice every morning helps to keep the body well hydrated.<br /><br /> The Benefits of Squeezed Orange Juice<br /> Everyone knows that the orange has many beneficial substances.  Eating an orange daily strengthens our immune system and drinking its juice makes it even easier to eat.  Moreover, one can have an abundant quantity of orange throughout the year…<br /><br /> Among the benefits of orange, you cannot put aside its antioxidant power that revives our immune system.  Antioxidants are used to purify our body of toxins that are generated by the foods we have eaten during the day.<br /><br /> Being rich in vitamin C, orange juice helps us maintain and strengthen our body's defense against attacks by bacteria and viruses.  A glass of freshly squeezed orange juice a day will help keep your body healthy and prevent disease for quite a while so much so that it is used as a cure.<br /><br /> As it is said before, orange juice is composed of a large amount of vitamin C. It is therefore an effective remedy to cure diseases like the flu.  However, it is important to point out that this is not a miracle cure, and that drinking orange juice now will not cure you immediately.  However, orange juice speeds your recovery by reducing flu symptoms.<br /><br /> But that's not all.  Freshly squeezed orange juice is also endowed with substances useful for the prevention of many diseases including cancer, cardiovascular disease and inflammation.  Precisely, cancer cells are cells that multiply in acidic bodies and since oranges are endowed with basic body nutrients, they help our metabolism to prevent cancer.<br /><br /> In addition, orange juice enriches our body with acids that are involved in DNA synthesis, thus in the production of red blood cells in the blood.  This means that orange juice participates in the good circulation of the blood of our body, namely the reduction of the risks of cardiovascular accidents and hypertension.  Check out our orange juicer reference page for the best orange juicers. …<br /><br /> Finally, although orange juice has many virtues, it is strictly forbidden to abuse it.<br /> However, it is not advisable to drink or eat an orange outside of the meal, especially on an empty stomach, because with its acidity, it could cause indigestion.<br /><br /> Source: Les dénicheurs <br /><br />💚 💚 💚 <br />*Rejoignez et Devenez membre de notre équipe de bénévoles en remplissant le formulaire à la cause que je soutiens: La SENSIBILISATION à la drépanosytose. <br />Ensemble nous pouvons!
