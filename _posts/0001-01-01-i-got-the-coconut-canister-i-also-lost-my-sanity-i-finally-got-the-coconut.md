{% raw %}I finally got the Coconut Canister in Bee Swarm Simulator. But it came at a cost - my sanity. Are you surprised at this point? Of course not because I suffer in these games in order to get to end game as quick as possible. Suffering is what I do. I am the suffer sus master. But I am finally end game and that is the goal. The next goal is some end game masks and more bees. Because why not?<br /><br />â–º I stream LIVE on my second channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFNnBvc8DAhEj1lc4syr0yA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFNnBvc8DAhEj1lc4syr0yA</a><br /><br />Follow me if you're cool:<br /><br />âž¤ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/VitaminDeeeeee">https://twitter.com/VitaminDeeeeee</a><br />âž¤ TikTok if you want to see my doge: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vitamindelicious">https://www.tiktok.com/@vitamindelicious</a><br />Business Inquiries: itsvitamindelicious@gmail.com<br /><br />::: Music :::<br />Music by Evan King<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ContextSensitive/">https://www.youtube.com/c/ContextSensitive/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EvanKingAudio">https://twitter.com/EvanKingAudio</a><br />Buy these songs at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://evanking.bandcamp.com">https://evanking.bandcamp.com</a><br />Or grab it as a free download at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.context-sensitive.com/">https://www.context-sensitive.com/</a>{% endraw %}
