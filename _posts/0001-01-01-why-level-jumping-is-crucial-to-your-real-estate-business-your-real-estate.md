{% raw %}Your real estate business may take on many shapes and forms. You could be wholesaling real estate, flipping real estate, or just simply buy-and-holding rental properties. No matter what you do, you probably want to scale faster with less time while bringing in more profit. In other words, you need to find the things in your business that allow you to ‚Äúlevel jump‚Äù and do them repeatedly.<br /><br />Someone who‚Äôs taking the level jumping philosophy to heart is investor, wholesaler, and flipper, Mike Simmons. Mike was facing the same fear that a lot of wholesalers were facing at the beginning of 2020. Deals were becoming harder to get, some sellers became more apprehensive of cash offers, and his team needed a new medium to reach potential buyers and sellers.<br /><br />Mike had to pivot not only his strategy, but his teams‚Äô values so everyone was on the same page. He sits down with BiggerPockets host David Greene to discuss what really makes a great team and how you can start level jumping yourself! <br /><br />~~~~<br />Join BiggerPockets for FREE üëá<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/signup?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/signup?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />~~~~<br />Check out Last Week‚Äôs Episode  with Glennda Baker: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/xJC8KwUoHuw">https://youtu.be/xJC8KwUoHuw</a> <br />~~~~<br />Listen to Mike‚Äôs Past Episode of the BiggerPockets Podcast:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/biggerpockets-podcast-389-mike-simmons?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/biggerpockets-podcast-389-mike-simmons?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> &amp; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2013-12-26-bp-podcast-050-getting-started-setting-partnerships-flipping-mike-simmons?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2013-12-26-bp-podcast-050-getting-started-setting-partnerships-flipping-mike-simmons?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />~~~~<br />Grab Mike‚Äôs Book ‚ÄúLevel Jumping‚Äù: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Level-Jumping-business-million-profits/dp/1734832703">https://www.amazon.com/Level-Jumping-business-million-profits/dp/1734832703</a><br />~~~~<br />The Newbie‚Äôs Guide to Wholesaling in 7 Simple Steps: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/newbie-guide-to-wholesaling?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/newbie-guide-to-wholesaling?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />~~~~<br />8 Ways to Craft a Positive, Productive Real Estate Workplace Culture: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2015-02-13-8-ways-craft-positive-real-estate-workplace-culture?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/2015-02-13-8-ways-craft-positive-real-estate-workplace-culture?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />~~~~<br />Which Company Culture Cultivates Competency‚ÄîCompetitive or Cooperative? <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/competitive-cooperative-company-culture?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/blog/competitive-cooperative-company-culture?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a>  <br />~~~~<br />Connect with David and Mike on BiggerPockets: <br />David: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/davidgreene24?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/davidgreene24?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br />Mike: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/mikesimmons?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none">https://www.biggerpockets.com/users/mikesimmons?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description&amp;utm_campaign=none</a> <br /><br />00:00 Getting Kicked in The Face<br />02:50 Less Work, More Profit<br />04:39 Finding Wholesale Deals<br />05:54 Doing What You Do Best<br />07:52 Level Jumping in Real Estate<br />08:52  Building a Winning Culture{% endraw %}
