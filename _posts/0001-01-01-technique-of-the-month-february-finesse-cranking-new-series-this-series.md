{% raw %}New series!!! This series is called Technique of the Month. Each month we will dive in depth into one of the Pick 4 baits and really dissect how to fish that technique. For February I felt we could cover a little more on the topic of finesse cranking. I do this a ton this time of year into March and maybe even early April. This is a great way to put fish in the boat including giants!{% endraw %}
