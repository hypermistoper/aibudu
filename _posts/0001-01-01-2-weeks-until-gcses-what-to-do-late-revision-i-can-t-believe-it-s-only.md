{% raw %}I can't believe it's only two weeks until our first exams, which is crazy! This video is for people who don't know what stage they should be at right now.<br /><br />Here's the plan I was talking about, it's for GCSE AQA Triple Science Higher:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://docdro.id/Rmm6FVv">https://docdro.id/Rmm6FVv</a><br />(anything in bold is a major focus from advanced info, so know it inside out)<br /><br />This was inspired by Primrose Kitten's revision guide:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brockington.leics.sch.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AQA-9-1-GCSE-Science-revision-pack-v6.pdf">http://www.brockington.leics.sch.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/AQA-9-1-GCSE-Science-revision-pack-v6.pdf</a><br /><br />Even though it's for the 2018-2019 exams, the info in it is really useful and there are TONS of retrieval questions and videos that you'll find useful.<br /><br />Thanks for watching the video!
