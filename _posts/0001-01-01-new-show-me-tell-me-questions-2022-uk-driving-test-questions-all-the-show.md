{% raw %}All the show me, tell me questions <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.driving-school-beckenham.co.uk/showme.html">https://www.driving-school-beckenham.co.uk/showme.html</a><br /><br />All the questions, all the answers and full explanations for your practical UK driving test. Questions based on a Ford Fiesta.<br /><br />These are the new 'show me, tell me' questions for the 2021 driving test.<br /><br />You will be asked one tell me question and one show me question. You won't fail your driving test for answering one of the questions wrong but you will get a driving fault (for answering one or both questions incorrectly). You can get a serious or dangerous fault if you lose control of the car when answering the 'show me' question.<br /><br />You'll be asked one 'tell me' question at the start of the driving test before you begin driving and one 'show me' question whilst you're driving.<br /><br />üöó Discounted award winning learner car insurance with Collingwood <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.collingwood.co.uk/learner-driver-insurance-adi?refid=267491">https://www.collingwood.co.uk/learner-driver-insurance-adi?refid=267491</a><br /><br />World Driving may earn a small commission on the link above if you use them but it helps support the channel and you get a good deal on your insurance :)<br /><br />‚òïÔ∏è Support our channel by buying us a coffee <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/worlddriving">https://ko-fi.com/worlddriving</a><br /><br />‚ñ∫ Once you've learnt the answers, test yourself with our 'show, me, tell me' quiz at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.driving-school-beckenham.co.uk/showmequiz.html">https://www.driving-school-beckenham.co.uk/showmequiz.html</a><br /><br />FAQ:<br />Will I fail my driving test for answering the show me, tell me questions incorrectly?<br />No you won't, you'll get one driving fault.
