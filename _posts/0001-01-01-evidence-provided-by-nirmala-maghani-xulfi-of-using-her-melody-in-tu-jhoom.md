{% raw %}#TuJhoom #CokeStudio #Xulfi<br /><br />Nirmala Maghani who’s an upcoming singer from Umarkot has got some guts to come forward and make such a big accusation against Xulfi. According to her, she had sent the sample of the melody to the Xulfi back in June last year to get a chance to feature in season 14.<br />But unfortunately, Xulfi didn’t respond to her messages, but when he heard the Tu Jhoom music it stuck in her head and realized that’s the same melody she sent to him.<br /><br />Nirmala Maghani accuses Xulfi of using her melody in Tu Jhoom<br />Nirmala Maghani came forward and shared the whole story. She said, “The melody is the same,” over the telephonic conversation with the local well-known newspaper.<br />“I have been calling Xulfi since I heard the song and after a day he finally responded by saying ‘I didn’t even download your audio file,’ which isn’t true because all my messages were received with blue ticks,” Maghani stressed the point that all she wants is recognition and due credit for her work and nothing else.<br /><br />“It’s about recognition of my work and being acknowledged for it, nothing else.”<br /><br />Not only her, Nirmala’s mentor who’s also a culture curator, composer, and lyricist Yousaf Salahuddin (Mian Salli) took the matter on social media.<br />He wrote, “The composition has been copied from Nirmala Maghani, who is a singer and composer from Umerkot, Tharparkar, she had sent to Xulfi for consideration in the then-upcoming season of Coke Studio,” he commented.<br /><br />“Zulfiqar (Xulfi) instead changed the words and sold this as his own to Coke Studio. This is highly inappropriate and legal action will be taken very soon.”{% endraw %}
