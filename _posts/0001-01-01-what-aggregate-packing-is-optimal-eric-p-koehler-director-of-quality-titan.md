{% raw %}Eric P. Koehler, Director of Quality, Titan America, Miami, FL<br /><br />The mechanical properties of portland cement concrete, such as mechanical strength, modulus of elasticity, creep, and shrinkage, greatly depend on the properties of their main constituent: the aggregates. Packing density, compaction degree, particle size, and spatial distribution of aggregates affect the macromechanical<br />behavior of concrete. This session will discuss how better aggregatesâ€™ packing and optimal distribution can improve the performance of concrete.{% endraw %}
