{% raw %}Thanks for Your support and Love. <br />A gear is a rotating circular machine part having cut teeth or, in the case of a cogwheel or gearwheel, inserted teeth (called cogs), which mesh with another (compatible) toothed part to transmit (convert) torque and speed. The basic principle behind the operation of gears is analogous to the basic principle of levers.<br /><br />New Method of Rebuilding Broken Timing Gear in Local Workshop | How to Repair Broken Teeth of Gear<br />A gear may also be known informally as a cog. Geared devices can change the speed, torque, and direction of a power source. Gears of different sizes produce a change in torque, creating a mechanical advantage, through their gear ratio, and thus may be considered a simple machine. The rotational speeds, and the torques, of two meshing gears differ in proportion to their diameters. The teeth on the two meshing gears all have the same shape<br /><br />#brokengearrepair<br />#rebuildbrokengear<br />#howtorepairgearteeth<br />#PakistaniTrucks{% endraw %}
