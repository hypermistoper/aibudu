{% raw %}When the Apostle Paul encouraged the believers in Philippi to &quot;rejoice in the Lord always,” and to “be anxious for nothing,” he wasn’t writing in ideal circumstances. In fact, he was under house arrest in Rome. He had also survived being whipped, shipwrecked, and stoned. On today’s Good Friday edition of Family Talk, Dr. James Dobson reminds us that Jesus said, &quot;If anyone would come after Me, he must deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me.” Like Paul, we need to learn the secret of contentment by trusting God no matter the circumstance. <br /> <br />About Today's Guest: Dr. James Dobson<br />Dr. James Dobson is the founder and president of the Dr. James Dobson Family Institute, a nonprofit organization that produces his radio program, &quot;Family Talk,&quot; which is heard on more than 1,400 outlets daily.
