{% raw %}Legislation to be published on Thursday is expected to stipulate that social gatherings must be confined to the same twelve people for as long as the regulations are active, a model referred to around the world as a 'social bubble'.<br /><br />When the Unlock the Rock document was published last week, it said social gatherings would be limited to twelve people. GBC understands these will need to be the same twelve people until the restrictions are lifted.{% endraw %}
