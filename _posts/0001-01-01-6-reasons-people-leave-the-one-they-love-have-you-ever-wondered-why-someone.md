{% raw %}Have you ever wondered why someone would break up with you even when they still love you? That feeling of abandonment can really hurt and it hurts because you know that you have love within your grasp and still, you let it slip away. It can make you question the entire relationship - would someone who loves you still find a way to abandon you? Why would a person so willingly walk away from love? To help you answer these questions, here are a few common reasons why people leave the one they love. <br /><br />Disclaimer: This video is for educational purposes and is not to suggest that you should end a relationship if you feel these things are happening in your own relationship. Sitting down with your partner to discuss this, is important or speaking to somebody you trust to support you. <br /><br />If you're currently dealing with a breakup and need some tips on how to cope with the pain, we have a video on that too: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Zpd8UzVEAC8">https://youtu.be/Zpd8UzVEAC8</a> <br /><br />Writer: Jade Hamilton<br />Script Editor: Morgan Franz <br />Script Manager: Kelly Soong <br />VO: Amanda Silvera<br />Animator: Aury <br />YouTube Manager: Cindy Cheong <br /><br />References: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/3rYLc75">http://bit.ly/3rYLc75</a><br /><br />Support our channel by joining our membership!
