{% raw %}NSW One Nation leader Mark Latham says the West’s “best hope out” of the Russia-Ukraine crisis is for the Russian people to “rise up against a failed leader”. <br /><br />“And not for the first time in our lifetime, to have a regime change. We’re all hoping Putin doesn’t last,” Mr Latham said. <br /><br />“At the moment, it looks like a miscalculation, in that the international opinion … is against Putin.<br /><br />“He runs the risk of his economy, a frail economy, being isolated and heavily damaged by the sanctions in the medium-term.”{% endraw %}
