{% raw %}Big goals require DISCIPLINE. By it's very nature, discipline requires you to do hard things - and that is a skill you can LEARN. I'm teaching my process to build Ironclad Discipline in a new workshop - you can register at discipline.impacttheory.com!<br /><br />What have you got hype about and decided to go after only to fall apart once you got started? Following through and getting to the finish line takes more than initial excitement. It takes focus, dedication, consistency and above all, it takes discipline for everything to work together. Tom is breaking down how you can establish and maintain discipline to start executing at a higher level  and see your goals to the finish line.<br /> <br />Tom’s Bright Lines For Success<br />1. Have a consistent bedtime &amp; prioritize sleep<br />2. Get out of bed without delay<br />3. Make your first task easy (i.e. set you gym clothes out the night before)<br />4. Have an Important Things list, always know what you should be doing<br /> <br />SHOW NOTES:<br /> <br />0:00 | Introduction to Discipline<br />0:32 | Steps to a Disciplined Routine<br />4:31 | Strategy for Dedication &amp; Focus<br />8:50 | Stay Focused, Not Distracted<br />12:56 | Consistency is the Key<br />18:07 | Push Beyond the Success<br /> <br />QUOTES:<br /> <br />“If you have big dreams, but you don't have the drive to see them through, you're just an empty dreamer.” [0:15]<br /> <br />“Once you know what you're trying to do, and why you're trying to achieve it, then we're going to put rules in place.” [0:48]<br /> <br />“Boredom kills more dreams than fear, and than failure.” [5:15]<br /> <br />“Find that thing where the more that you engage with it, the more fascinating it becomes.” [10:33]<br /> <br />“It's very important for you to make the right choice, the easy choice: [14:05]<br /> <br />“Discipline isn't meant to make your life suck. As Jocko Willink says, ‘discipline equals freedom’.” [16:27]<br /> <br />“If you do all of the individual things that are fun, it ends up where you feel like crap, and if you do, individually, all the things that are hard and are a struggle and are difficult, you end up feeling awesome.” [20:32]<br /> <br />“No matter how much success you have, you still need progress. You still need to be moving forward in your life. You still need to be gaining skills. There is no retiring, not if you want to be fulfilled.” [22:16]<br /> <br />Follow Tom Bilyeu:<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://impacttheory.com/">https://impacttheory.com/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TomBilyeu">https://twitter.com/TomBilyeu</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tombilyeu/">https://www.instagram.com/tombilyeu/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/tombilyeu">https://www.facebook.com/tombilyeu</a>{% endraw %}
