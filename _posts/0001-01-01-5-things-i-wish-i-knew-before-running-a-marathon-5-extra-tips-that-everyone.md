{% raw %}The five things I wish I knew before training for, and racing my FIRST ever marathon. I also cover five things I already knew, but that helped me immensely in preparing for and racing that debut marathon. Hopefully my advice and experiences will be helpful if you are a beginner runner or looking to race that first marathon and wondering what to expect!
