{% raw %}In this video I demonstrate how to put in eye drops correctly. This video is especially useful for anyone who has to instill eye drops on oneself without assistance. Putting in eye drops can be a challenge for anyone, but knowing the correct way of how to do it will make instilling eye drops much easier. In this video I explain the reasons for all the steps, as well as offer practical tips to make the process of instilling eye drops go more smoothly. The information in this video can also be referenced by nurses or healthcare professionals when giving discharge instructions to patients on how to put in eye drops correctly.<br /><br />I am a dual certified family and pediatric nurse practitioner. I worked many years as a registered nurse (RN) in the emergency room, then continued working in the emergency room after becoming a nurse practitioner (NP). I love the teaching aspect of nursing and love to make videos that will help both nurses and patients alike. <br />Please like and share this video if you enjoyed it or found it helpful! <br />Please subscribe to my channel and hit the notification bell to get all my future videos! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC56v3cPLfJaQgA1KTF5AGHQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC56v3cPLfJaQgA1KTF5AGHQ</a><br /><br />Disclaimer: While I make every effort to provide correct information in these educational videos, there may be unintentional errors.
