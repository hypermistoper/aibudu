{% raw %}The biggest van life challenge we've EVER taken on! - can we even do this?! Well.. we did it - sort of, all three dogs are still alive and well if that means we've succeeded?! 😂<br /><br />In a nutshell we've been road tripping Morocco now for nearly 4 months. We started our van life journey from the UK back in October and are only getting back to the UK now!<br />On the way we've picked up three rescue dogs from Morocco Animal Aid <br />and we're currently in the middle of transporting them back to the UK to be adopted by loving families ❤️ Van life with these nuggets is SO much fun, watch as we make our way to Paris and show them the Eiffel tower!<br />This is Part one of the madness of 5 in a van 😂  See how we navigate van life with three dogs!<br /><br />Donate to Morocco Animal Aid here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://moroccoanimalaid.com/">https://moroccoanimalaid.com/</a> <br /><br />🚍 Our bus stats:<br />2001 Mercedes Vario 814<br />4.2 Litre Diesel <br />Was 24 seats (now 2) <br />Air Suspension<br /><br />🚗 Top 10 videos to watch on Kinging-it’s channel:WATCH HERE! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/3uHC5sy">http://bit.ly/3uHC5sy</a><br /><br />➡️👫 A bit about US- <br />We are Craig and Aimee, from South Wales, UK.
