{% raw %}#abandonedinorphanage #childfromorphanage #momgavemeup<br /><br />When my father became ill, something changed in my mom’s attitude towards me, but I had no idea what it was… And when my dad passed away, my mom turned into a different person in an instant, as if I’d never known her.<br /><br />Soon after my father’s funeral my mom packed my belongings and sent me to an orphanage. I ended up in the orphanage despite having a living mother! She swore it was temporary and said she did what she had to do and would come back for me…<br /><br />To dull my sadness and loneliness, I’d often write letters to her; I thought she’d be interested to know how I was doing and what was happening in my life… But when I grew up, I realized who my mother really was and why she was unworthy of my love.{% endraw %}
