{% raw %}* (Disclaimer: This video content is intended for educational and informational purposes only) *<br />Charlotte, North Carolina â€”  The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) released body-worn camera (BWC) video of an officer-involved shooting that occurred on November 5, 2021, that was ordered for release after the media petitioned the courts.<br /><br />PRIOR TO THE EVENT THAT SAME DAY<br />Just before 6:00 a.m. on November 5, 2021, CMPD officers responded to the 6700 block of Winding Cedar Trail in the Hickory Grove Division. The call was in reference to a subject (Derrell Raney), who said he found two dead bodies behind the address. Officers searched the area and found no evidence or validity to Raney's claims. Members of CMPD's Crisis Intervention Team also responded. They urged Raney to be evaluated at the hospital but he refused any kind of treatment. The officers found Raney to be lucid and not a danger to himself or others, so they did not have cause to seek involuntary commitment papers on the family's behalf. Officers reached out to Raney's family to notify them of the situation and explain how to seek an involuntary commitment order.<br /><br />LATER THAT DAY<br />Around 4:30 p.m. later that afternoon, CMPD officers responded to 9025 Albemarle Road in reference to an unrelated call for service. While addressing this call, officers responded to a subsequent, yet separate, call for service at the Food Lion next door at 9021 Albemarle Road. While officers were addressing this call for service, Walmart security approached officers and stated that someone pointed a firearm at one of their security guards in the parking lot in the 9100 block of Albemarle Road.<br /><br />Just after 5:50 p.m. Officers Longworth and Edmunds were flagged down by Walmart security and responded to a different area of the parking lot to investigate the information they received from the security personnel. The security guard pointed them in the direction of Raney who was seated in the grass with a backpack in front of him and his right hand concealed inside the backpack. Both officers gave verbal commands to Raney to show them his hands. Raney did not comply and removed the firearm from the bag while keeping it partially concealed. <br /><br />The officers continued to command Raney to drop the firearm. Raney then began to raise the firearm up in the direction of the officers. Officer Edmunds and Officer Longworth discharged their service weapons. The officers secured Raney's firearm. Arriving officers began life-saving efforts. Raney was transported to the hospital but succumbed to his injuries and was pronounced deceased around 6:30 p.m.<br /><br />Donate to PoliceActivity: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity">https://www.patreon.com/PoliceActivity</a><br />Like us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PoliceActivity">https://www.facebook.com/PoliceActivity</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Police_Activity">https://twitter.com/Police_Activity</a>{% endraw %}
