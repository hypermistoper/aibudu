All flooring types that are available for purchase were intended to be put into houses or apartments, which means that there is no perfect set in stone way to install a floor in a camper van.  <br /><br />There are several options of materials to use as flooring when building a camper van, but some of the most common are laminate and vinyl.  Vinyl flooring can be purchased in sheets, flooring planks, or as peel and stick tiles.  Laminate flooring only comes in the form of flooring planks.  My personal favorite type of flooring to use is water resistant laminate flooring planks.  Laminate flooring is the second most lightweight option next to peel and stick tiles, but is much more durable than peel and stick and is very inexpensive.  <br /><br />Waterproof vinyl flooring planks are definitely the best as far as durability goes, but these flooring planks are extremely heavy when compared to the other options, and are by far the most expensive option available.<br /><br />I like to do my flooring at the beginning of the van build right after the deep cleaning is done.  I would rather have the floor completely done while I build the furniture that sits on top of the floor afterwards because the furniture will help hold the flooring together once it is installed.  <br /><br />Another option is building your furniture first and then adding flooring afterwards to save money on flooring material.  If I were building a house, I would definitely be doing this option; However, in a tiny space like a van (especially in a Ford Transit Connect), I won't be saving any money because I'm not buying multiple boxes of flooring. <br /><br />Tags:<br />urban stealth camping,camper van,stealth camping,tiny house tour,tiny home,van life,van tour,camper remodel before and after,van conversion,van conversion solar,van build,stealth camper van,stealth camper,stealth camper van build,camper van conversion,off grid living,portable power station,van solar system,van solar setup,diy van solar setup,solar power van,solar power van setup,van conversion solar setup,van life solar,van electrical install{% endraw %}
