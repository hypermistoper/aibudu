{% raw %}Kimchi Jeon <br />Parmesan Kimchi Jeon or regular, both works<br />Ingredients<br />* 1 cup kimchi + 2 tbsp juice<br />* 1 tsp gochujang (optional for extra heat)<br />* â…“ cup parmesan, grated + extra parmesan for garnish<br />* Â¼ - â…“ cup ice cold water<br />* 2 tbsp AP flour<br />* 2 tbsp potato / corn starch <br />* black pepper<br />* 2 tbsp neutral oil, for frying<br /><br />1. In a medium sized bowl, add your kimchi, and gochujang. <br />2. Using kitchen scissors, cut the kimchi into fine pieces. (PRO TIP: I like using scissors because kimchi stains on wooden/white plastic cutting boards!)<br />3. Add the parmesan, starch and the flour into the mixture. Gently mix to combine. Do not over mix.<br />4. Drizzle in Â¼ cup of ice water. The consistency of the batter should be quite thin. It should be like tempura batter, or as seen in the video.<br />5. On high heat, put your well-seasoned skillet or non-stick pan.<br />6. Once the pan has come up to temperature, drizzle in the oil.<br />7. Scoop around 2 tbsp of batter into the oil. Gently spread it out. Do not overcrowd the pan.<br />8. Sprinkle a pinch of parmesan on top of the batter. This allows for a crispy cheesy bottom when flipped.<br />9. The jeon should gradually release from the pan, but if not, gently scrape it from the bottom using a spatula.<br />10. Once the bottom is golden brown, around 4 minutes, flip.<br />11. Cook for another 4 minutes or until golden brown.<br />12. Transfer to a lined wire tray and allow the jeon to slightly cool down. This allows excess moisture to evaporate from the jeon. DO NOT stack the jeon on top of each other as it will steam and get soggy.<br />-<br />Music<br />stay in bed- victor lundberg<br />luv-bomuli<br />Music by monomenu - khruangboing - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thmatc.co/?l=14BC1B62">https://thmatc.co/?l=14BC1B62</a><br />-<br />Instagram @doobydobap  <br />Join my discord! ðŸ˜ˆ<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/doobyverse">https://discord.gg/doobyverse</a><br />www.doobydobap.com for recipes &amp; stories{% endraw %}
