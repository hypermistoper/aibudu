For most people, your employment income will have roughly the proper amount of tax deducted some come tax time, so there isn't too much change come tax time. For retirement income, because it's coming from numerous sources, there could be withholding tax on the different types of income. As a result, you could end up having more tax withheld than you actually will owe. While you will get a refund come tax time, this also means that your cash flow throughout the year will be less than it otherwise would have been. This is particularly important regarding your first year of retirement, so make sure you have an understanding that it's going to be a bit wonky!<br /><br />If you have any further questions about this video's topic or any financial planning questions in general, I encourage you to find a certified financial planner in your area or book a consultation with us to get your savings plan on track.  You can learn more about our services at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.parallelwealth.com/planning">https://www.parallelwealth.com/planning</a> or email Info@Parallelwealth.com<br /><br />6 ways to level up your financial plan:<br />Personal Finance for Canadians for Dummies: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/308jzic">https://amzn.to/308jzic</a><br />Free Credit Report with Borrowell: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://borrowell.com/free-credit-score?utm_source=refer2020-1886159">https://borrowell.com/free-credit-score?utm_source=refer2020-1886159</a> <br />Open an EQ Bank Account: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://join.eqbank.ca?code=ADAM8851">https://join.eqbank.ca?code=ADAM8851</a> <br />Financial Calculator I use: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3qiFf6m">https://amzn.to/3qiFf6m</a><br />Financial Masterclass for Canadians: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.parallelwealth.com/masterclass">https://www.parallelwealth.com/masterclass</a><br />20% off an online Will at www.willful.co use promo code: PWFG<br /><br />OUTLINE<br />0:00 - Tax Issue In Retirement<br />0:46 - Client Scenario Rundown<br />1:45 - RRSP Conversion Issue<br />1:58 - Withholding Tax Compared To Tax Payable<br />2:52 - Effective Tax Rate<br />3:15 - Potential Solution<br />3:52 - Year 2<br />4:12 - RRIF Minimum<br />5:06 - Withholding Tax Rates<br />5:37 - Less Withheld In Year 2<br />6:16 - Tax Savings: Default vs. Meltdown<br />7:27 - Laddered Income<br /><br />This presentation is intended for information purposes only and does not constitute an offer to buy or sell our products or services nor is it intended as investment and/or financial advice on any subject matter.
