{% raw %}This psychic surgery ASMR is designed to help you tackle insomnia. There are relaxing glove sounds, gentle hand movements, and lots and lots of personal attention. I don’t think it needs to be said again, but psychic surgery isn’t exactly real, so do please take it with a pinch of salt, but hopefully it’ll help with your sleep if you’re in one (a pinch, that is).

It’s a relaxing feeling, it’s a tingling down the spine, or it’s simply a sleep aid. Whether it’s being ‘held’ by someone you have confidence in, or ‘looked after’ by someone with authority, or just feeling ‘safe’ with someone you trust, it uses audio-visual triggers to enable you to let go of your worries and stresses – even just for a bit.<br /><br />📽 What is FPC? 🎞<br /><br />FPC (first person cinema) takes all the relaxing elements of ASMR but has much more of a focus on immersion and the suspension of disbelief. It’s kinda like being the main character in your own short movie, with popular figures you know and love, or entirely created worlds – just for you. There won’t be any visible mics or traditional triggers in these videos, and they will seem more unintentional than the usual ASMR videos – but they are unique and relaxing experiences designed to transport you to different places, worlds, and times. <br /><br />Disclaimer: This video is intended for relaxation. Any views, opinions, or advice expressed is purely for the purpose of entertainment, and to induce tingles through ASMR. These videos are not a substitute for traditional medicine, therapy, or any other professional medium, and should not be treated as such! Take all the advice with a pinch of salt, and certainly don’t take it to heart. That being said, please enjoy them, benefit from them, and hopefully get those warm, tingly feelings. Oh, and it’s not for kids.{% endraw %}
