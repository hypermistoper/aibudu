{% raw %}Conway Twitty performing Fifteen Years Ago<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />I saw a man today who said he talked to you<br />not so long ago, I think a month or two<br />as my mind raced back in time I prayed<br />oh, Lord, don't let it show<br />he thinks I forgot you fifteen years ago<br />Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same<br />why did he have to mention your name<br />I'm as broken up inside as if it's been a week or so<br />it takes a mighty strong love<br />to get a real love off your mind<br />I know, I've tried since fifteen years ago<br />I've got a lovely wife who thinks the world of me<br />I promised her my love through all eternity<br />I've tried hard to make her happy<br />and so far, she doesn't know<br />That I can't shake this thing of fifteen years ago<br />Fifteen years ago and I still feel the same<br />why did he have to mention your name<br />I'm as broken up inside as if it's been a week or so<br />It takes a mighty strong love<br />To keep a man thinking of<br />A girl he hasn't seen since fifteen years ago<br />--<br /><br />(C) 1970 Decca Records{% endraw %}
