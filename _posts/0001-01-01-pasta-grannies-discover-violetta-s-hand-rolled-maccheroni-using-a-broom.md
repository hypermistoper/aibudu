{% raw %}We're in Sant Arcangelo Basilicata this week. Violetta, helped by husband Giovanni, shares her recipe for 'maccheroni a cannicell' col sugo di capretto' which translates as macaroni hand rolled with a little cane with a kid-goat sauce. <br /><br />To make the pasta, use 400g of 'semola rimacinata' or finely ground semolina flour, a teaspoon of salt and around 250ml of warm water.<br />To make the sauce, use 500g of cubed kid-goat or lamb steaks. (Violetta used leg), a garlic clove, a small bunch of parsley, 2 large fresh ripe tomatoes, skinned and chopped and 400ml of tomato passata, and salt. This sugo only needs to simmer for about 30-40 minutes as kid is so tender.<br /><br />Editor: Charlie Williams{% endraw %}
