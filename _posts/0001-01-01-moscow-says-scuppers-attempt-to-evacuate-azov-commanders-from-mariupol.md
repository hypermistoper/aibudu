The Apache and its crew were now being escorted to the southern Russian port of Yeysk.<br /><br />Members of the Azov battalion have been fighting Russians in the besieged city of Mariupol, located in the country’s southeast between Russia-occupied Crimea and pro-Russian separatist regions in Ukraine’s east.<br /><br />The Azov Special Operations Detachment, previously known as the “Azov Battalion,” has been at the heart of Moscow’s propaganda campaign accusing the Kyiv authorities of ties to Nazi elements.{% endraw %}
