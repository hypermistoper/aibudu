{% raw %}An introduction to the meaning of the planet Pluto in astrology, with astrologers Richard Tarnas and Chris Brennan.<br /><br />In astrology Pluto is generally associated with power, control, manipulation, intensity, the underworld, taboos, transformations, destruction and regeneration, death and rebirth, making big things small and small things big.<br /><br />Richard is the author of the 2006 book Cosmos and Psyche: Intimations of a New World View, and he previously appeared on episode 84 of The Astrology Podcast in 2016 to talk about the book on its 10 year anniversary:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTdwE_qVTE0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JTdwE_qVTE0</a><br /><br />At the beginning of the episode we talked a bit about the recent conjunction of Saturn and Pluto in 2020, how it coincided with the beginning of the pandemic, and how Richard felt about having discussed that cycle in Cosmos and Psyche in retrospect. Some of this was tied into a discussion in episode 254 titled Misconceptions About Mundane Astrology in the Media:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvHiJaX33T0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvHiJaX33T0</a><br /><br />Later we get into the discovery of Pluto, discuss how astrologers establish the meaning of new planets, and then read through some passages from different astrologers that talk about the meaning of Pluto.<br /><br />Later in the episode we also touch on how to deal with skeptics of astrology, and how to demonstrate the validity of astrology in general.<br /><br />We also discuss a new astrology documentary series based on Richard's work titled Changing of the Gods, which will be released next month.<br /><br />Find out more about Changing of the Gods series at:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://changingofthegodsseries.com">https://changingofthegodsseries.com</a><br /><br />This is episode 336 of The Astrology Podcast:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://theastrologypodcast.com/2022/01/20/pluto-in-astrology-meaning-and-significations/">https://theastrologypodcast.com/2022/01/20/pluto-in-astrology-meaning-and-significations/</a><br /><br />Patreon:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/astrologypodcast">https://www.patreon.com/astrologypodcast</a><br /><br />#TheAstrologyPodcast<br /><br />Timestamps:<br /><br />00:00:00 Introduction<br />00:02:25 Welcoming Richard + Changing of the Gods series<br />00:08:25 Uranus-Pluto alignments<br />00:11:10 Reflections on the Saturn-Pluto conjunction of 2020<br />00:32:07 How do astrologers establish the meaning of new planets?    <br />00:57:00 Pluto significations in Reinhold Ebertin<br />01:05:09 Robert Hand's Pluto significations<br />01:12:48 Richard Tarnas' Pluto significations<br />01:31:30 World events coinciding with Pluto's discovery<br />01:38:45 Pluto return of the United States<br />01:46:40 Depth psychology and Pluto<br />02:05:47 Pluto makes big things small and small things big<br />02:11:02 Venus-Pluto aspects<br />02:25:05 Jupiter-Pluto aspects<br />02:33:25 Orbs and Archetypal Explorer<br />02:43:04 Dealing with skeptics of astrology<br />02:57:35 The goal of Cosmos and Psyche<br />03:08:10 Experience vs. intellectual argument for convincing skeptics<br />03:15:30 Pluto's demotion to dwarf planet<br />03:30:46 Astrology as a gift from the cosmos<br />03:36:09 Changing of the Gods documentary <br />03:39:16 Concluding remarks, patrons, and sponsors{% endraw %}
