{% raw %}I held my peace for as long as I could although I was being talked about in and out of the congregation; and made to look like a bad guy.  People were treating and mocking me in social media like I was some filthy criminal when all I ever did was hold on to the faith and the biblical teachings and principles I have learned from Brother Eli for the last twenty plus years of my life; and because I was subject of ridicule for months and months (even if they are not mentioning my name), outsiders were quick to sniff on the situation and they dragged me, my little son, and my family into social media.  Now, it's time to break my silence and let you all know an unheard truth.  #theunheardtruth.{% endraw %}
