{% raw %}You'll be approached by friendly locals all day long in Nepal, but usually, they're just rip-off salesmen in disguise. I'll show you exactly how to identify them and how you can avoid them when you're in Nepal.<br /><br />One of the most common approaches is a stranger offering to take you to &quot;their&quot; art school in Nepal, do not go! This is the art school scam, and it's just a sales trick to get you into a store so they can overcharge you for low-quality student-level Thangka paintings. I shopped around and found the same products for more than 50% less in the tourist area of Thamel in Kathmandu.<br /><br />The most important thing to learn before travelling to Nepal or India is to learn to say &quot;No.&quot; And not be afraid to walk away even when these salesmen put pressure on you to buy. Just say &quot;No&quot; and walk away.<br /><br />Travel safely and enjoy Nepal! I recommend doing trekking there. Even if you're not a trekker, you could start with the beginner-level 3-5 day Mardi Himal trek.<br /><br />Avoid these 4 dangerous things in Nepal too: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Luq3z2uOJ44.">https://youtu.be/Luq3z2uOJ44.</a> <br /><br />Plus, find out how to find great food in Nepal <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/1rOlskhOr4w.">https://youtu.be/1rOlskhOr4w.</a><br /><br />Marketing of Paintings: A Case of Thangka Paintings <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sgsrjournals.co.in/paperdownload/15_Archana%20Rani%20-%20Thangka%20Paintings.pdf.">https://sgsrjournals.co.in/paperdownload/15_Archana%20Rani%20-%20Thangka%20Paintings.pdf.</a><br /><br />00:00 The friendly local scam in Nepal exposed<br />00:24 Oops, a street hustler recognises me!<br />01:11 The 3 most common scammer approaches<br />03:16 Going to an &quot;art school&quot; with a friendly local<br />08:37 See their guilt trip sales tactics when I try to leave<br />09:50 How to find authentic Thangka paintings in Nepal<br />10:23 The actual price of Thangka paintings<br />11:14 How to identify master-level Thangka paintings<br />11:51 How to avoid the friendly local scam<br /><br />Song credits: Engaged by Dylan Sitts, Clips by Cushy, New Game Old by Push N' Glide.<br /><br />👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇👇<br /><br />1) SUBSCRIBE! ✔ Click<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/KarlRock/?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/KarlRock/?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />Then smash the BELL ICON so you don't miss a 🔴live stream or video.<br /><br />2) SUPPORT THE CONTENT I CREATE &amp; GET SPECIAL BENEFITS 🙏🏻❤️<br />Press the blue JOIN button or <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtfXgNnA-QcxjHJjk5wXLFg/join.">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtfXgNnA-QcxjHJjk5wXLFg/join.</a><br /><br />3) WANT TO TRAVEL TO INDIA?<br />Read my quick-start safety guide at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.karlrock.com/india-survival-guide/.">https://blog.karlrock.com/india-survival-guide/.</a><br /><br />4) WANT TO LEARN HINDI हिन्दी?<br />Learn Hindi Faster Than I Did! is free at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.karlrock.com/how-to-learn-hindi-faster-than-i-did/.">https://blog.karlrock.com/how-to-learn-hindi-faster-than-i-did/.</a><br /><br />5) LET'S CONNECT 👋🏻<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/iamkarlrock/">https://www.instagram.com/iamkarlrock/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/iamkarlrock">https://www.facebook.com/iamkarlrock</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/iamkarlrock">https://twitter.com/iamkarlrock</a><br /><br />#Scams #Scammers #Scam #Nepal #Thangka #ArtSchool #Kathmandu #Thamel #VisitNepal #ExploreNepal #Art #Fake #TravelSafety #nahichahiyeji #travelscams{% endraw %}
