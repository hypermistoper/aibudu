{% raw %}We are happy to bring you our first episode out of NYC.<br />Join our day with Queen's original Marcello Campanello as we check out his place, talk about graphics for Maxallure he's been working on, visit Belief shop before getting a proper breakfast. We then take it to the iconic Flushing Meadows globe, meet Marcello's dad and skate some more at Tompkins. Last but not least some proper cuisine to end the day. <br /><br />Filmed by Dennis Ludwig<br />Edited by Bennet Rahm<br />Motion Graphics by Stephan PÃ¶hlmann <br /><br />Get our books &amp; apparel collection here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pocketskatemag.com/shop/">https://pocketskatemag.com/shop/</a><br /><br />Feel free to subscribe to our channel and follow us on Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/pocketskatemag">http://www.instagram.com/pocketskatemag</a> <br /><br />Our Website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.pocketskatemag.com">http://www.pocketskatemag.com</a>{% endraw %}
