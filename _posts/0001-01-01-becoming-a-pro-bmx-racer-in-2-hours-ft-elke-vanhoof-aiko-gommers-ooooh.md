{% raw %}Ooooh we're back! Extremely hyped for the weekly upload again. This week we went BMX racing with 2 of the most talented ladies to ever paddle on a bike. Elke Vanhoof who's a multiple belgian champ and 2x olympian. And then there's Aiko Gommers who's an upcoming supertalent and world champion in pumptrack. The only problem is: we're both pretty damn scared of bikes because of bad experiences haha. Let's see if we can learn how to ride this thing and race eachother. What's on the line? Eternal glory. Go!<br /><br />THANK YOU AIKO AND ELKE, GO SHOW THEM SOME LOVE<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/aikogommers">https://www.instagram.com/aikogommers</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/elkevanhoof91">https://www.instagram.com/elkevanhoof91</a><br /><br />GET SOME MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://averagerob.com">https://averagerob.com</a><br /><br />instagram rob: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/averagerob">http://instagram.com/averagerob</a><br />instagram arno: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/arnothekid">http://instagram.com/arnothekid</a><br />filmed &amp; edited by milan: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/milancools">https://www.instagram.com/milancools</a>{% endraw %}
