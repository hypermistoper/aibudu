Your quads, your hip flexors, your inner thighs, and your glutes need to get stronger and more flexible in different angles. <br /><br />Being able to Asian squat will help you maintain leg strength and hip mobility as you age. That strength and mobility will contribute to better athletic performance, less chronic pain, and will make you a fun adult to be around for kids! <br /><br /><br />#AsianSquats #PrimalSquat #UprightHealth{% endraw %}
