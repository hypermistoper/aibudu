{% raw %}This life is all about the lessons, isn’t it? I want to share with you 7 major lessons I learned during 2 years of living in this wonderful country - NORWAY 🇳🇴 <br /><br />⏱⏱⏱ TIME CODES:<br />00:00 - WELCOME to NORWAY 🇳🇴 &amp; Let’s Go Hiking <br />01:25 1️⃣ There’s No Such Thing As BAD WEATHER - ONLY BAD CLOTHING <br />03:00 2️⃣ EVERY WEATHER IS GREAT IN NORWAY 🇳🇴 Even Norwegian Winter Is Fantastic<br />05:41 3️⃣ When You Work - WORK! No Distractions<br />07:09 4️⃣ Recycling in Norway 🇳🇴<br />09:20 5️⃣ Alcohol in Norway 🇳🇴 How Expensive to Buy Alcohol in Norway?<br />11:26 6️⃣ You Don’t Need to Have Lots of Things to Be Happy <br />13:02 7️⃣ You Don’t Need Much To Be Happy. Being Happy = Being Simple<br /><br />✅ there’s no such thing as a bad weather only bad clothing - Norwegian saying 😉<br /><br />From an early age Norwegians soon learn how to dress appropriately. Grasping the concept of layering is just as important as learning to count.<br /><br />1. Layers - when you truly understand the art of layering your clothes you’ll be truly unstoppable. No matter what sort of weather is outside <br /><br />2. Invest in decent set of winter clothes which includes winter shoes, wind and waterproof trousers and jacket. I would also add here hat, neckwarmer and the gloves - but those are minor details. <br /><br />✅ EVERY WEATHER IS GREAT AND EVEN WINTER CAN BE FANTASTIC in Norway 🇳🇴 <br /><br />Norway showed me that winter can be so much fun! Especially if your clothes are right.<br />You can do snow shoeing, dog sledding, ice fishing, riding snow mobile, chase the northern lights.<br /><br />Summer time we have endless hiking, fishing, swimming in the lakes<br /><br />✅ 3 - WHEN YOU WORK - WORK 🇳🇴<br /><br />Norwegians leave the office quite early but don’t forget they coming there at around 7:30 - 8am.<br />At 7:40 you are already chatting with your Norwegian colleagues around that coffee machine in the office! <br /><br />And the real magic happens at 8am.<br />Starting from 8am to 4pm - Norwegians tend to switch off their personal phones and concentrate only on their work. <br /><br />That’s why Norwegians leave the office earlier than the rest of Europe. <br />And what’s more important - that’s how they make their tasks complete on time with no stress. <br /><br />✅ 4 - RECYCLING in Norway 🇳🇴 <br /><br />Up to 92% of the bottles recycled hold such high-quality material, that it can be re-used again in drink bottles, sometimes more than 50 times. This is an incredible achievement, considering 91% of plastic produced worldwide isn’t recycled, and eight million metric tons of wind up in the sea every year. For example, in the UK, the recycling rate for plastic bottles is anywhere between 20% to 25%, and in the US, it’s about 30%.<br /><br />Without a financial incentive, consumers and companies have no motivation to do the right thing for the environment, which is why Norway has given recycling value.<br /><br />How does the scheme work? Norway’s model is formed on a loan scheme, where the plastic bottle consumers purchase does not belong to them; they are only borrowing it. When a consumer buys a bottle, they are charged a small fee of about 13 to 30 US cents, depending on the size.<br /><br />✅ 5 - LIFE WITHOUT ALCOHOL in Norway 🇳🇴 <br /><br />Norway has its gorgeous nature! Fascinating fiords, endless forests, crystal clear lakes.. adorable fisherman villages.. Northern lights winter time at the end of the day! Go and explore it, go out and enjoy the nature!<br />While you are in Norway do as Norwegians do - fill your flask with a filter coffee, lake a few quick lunches with you and go enjoy the nature!<br /><br />✅ 6 - YOU DON’T NEED TO HAVE LOTS OF THINGS — like clothes and shoes in life to be happy.<br /><br />In Norway I realised that shopping doesn’t have to do anything with stress release.<br />If you feel that you are getting stressed - get out and get some fresh air. <br />More stress - longer hours outdoors. And this really helps.<br /><br />✅ 7 - YOU DON’T NEED MUCH TO BE HAPPY<br /><br />Your health is the key and the main reason to be happy.<br /><br />Being able waking up in the morning without coughing, without feeling any pain. Being able to breathe flawlessly, feeling tastes and smells of life, having fresh air outside your window and being blessed with a clean water to drink - that’s a real happiness.<br /><br />📸 My Filming Gear:<br />SONY ZV1 - BEST Vlogging Camera - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2V0eVAS">https://amzn.to/2V0eVAS</a><br />SONY GRIP TRIPOD - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3zMalVr">https://amzn.to/3zMalVr</a><br />RØDE Vlogging Mic - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WxY48Z">https://amzn.to/2WxY48Z</a><br /><br />GoPro HERO 9 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3hZlay7">https://amzn.to/3hZlay7</a><br />GoPro Remote Control <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3f9Ctu9">https://amzn.to/3f9Ctu9</a><br />GoPro Selfie Stick with Tripod Stand <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3oE9eTH">https://amzn.to/3oE9eTH</a><br /><br />AFFILIATE DISCLOSURE:<br />This video and description may contain affiliate links, which means that if you click on one of the product links, I’ll receive a small commission.
