{% raw %}Hey Family, today I did a short video on how I used my Loveseat as a Settee for seating around the dining room table. <br /><br />Before I would put the loveseat and sofa very close together almost like a sectional, but it was not utilizing the pieces properly. I removed my dining table set twice over the last few years trying to have more space in the Living Room. <br /><br />But I decided to try the loveseat as a settee, and keep my loveseat and sofa as it should be. Now I can continue setting my dining table.{% endraw %}
