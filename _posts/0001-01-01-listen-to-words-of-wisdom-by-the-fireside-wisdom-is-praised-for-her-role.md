{% raw %}Wisdom is praised for her role in creation.  Proverbs raises questions of values, moral behavior, the meaning of human life, and righteous conduct. <br />Wisdom, or the wise person, is compared and contrasted with foolishness or the fool, meaning one who is lacking in wisdom and uninterested in instruction, not one who is merely silly or playful. Be wise!<br /><br />Don't go through your dry season alone. Put your prayer request in the comment below and the Pure Daily Prayers community members will put you in their prayers.<br /><br />God Bless You.<br /><br />We love You.<br /><br />CREDIT:<br />Video from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pexels.com">https://www.pexels.com</a><br /><br />PEACE - DEEP INSTRUMENTAL WORSHIP - (NO COPYRIGHT MUSIC)<br />Produced by: @Davidlastra12<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/_k7RQ6RlUc8">https://youtu.be/_k7RQ6RlUc8</a>{% endraw %}
