{% raw %}The term &quot;self-realization&quot; is extensively utilized in Western philosophy, psychology, and spirituality. It is absolutely true for Indian religions also. It may be regarded as the completion of the possibilities of the character or countenance by a human being. Self-realization is a liberated awareness of the genuine Self. It is either an eternal consciousness known as essence or the absence of a perpetual self.{% endraw %}
