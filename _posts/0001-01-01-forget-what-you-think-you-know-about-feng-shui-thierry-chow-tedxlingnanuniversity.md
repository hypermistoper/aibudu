{% raw %}By modernising Feng Shui, the idea is to bring a new perspective onto what feng shui really is, and how we can use it to have a greater awareness of our environment and the people around us. <br /><br />Thierry Chow is a designer and a C apprentice.  After obtaining her Bachelor of Applied Illustration from Sheridan College in Toronto, Canada, she began working on various design projects.  <br /><br /><br /><br />In 2011 she started apprenticing under her father, Mr. Chow Hon Ming, a well-respected Feng Shui Master who for the past 30 years has been practicing from his base in Hong Kong.<br /><br /><br /><br />In 2013, she founded TRE, a contemporary feng shui concept that provides a fresh new outlook which incorporates creative ideas modernizing Feng Shui with a 21st century twist. <br /><br /><br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
