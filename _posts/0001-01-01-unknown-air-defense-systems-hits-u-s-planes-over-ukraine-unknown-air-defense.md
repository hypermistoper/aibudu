{% raw %}Unknown air defense and electronic warfare systems drove U.S planes out of Donbass<br /><br />U.s military aircraft left the airspace under the threat of an air defense attack. <br /><br />Unknown medium and long-range air defense systems were able to successfully prevent the US Air Force from carrying out a provocative mission in the Donbass. This follows from the information provided by the Flightradar24 service. At the same time, it is alleged that American planes initially tried to conduct reconnaissance near the border with Belarus and then advance to the Donbass, however, the mission was unexpectedly interrupted. <br /><br />In the presented image, you can see the flight paths of US military reconnaissance aircraft. The RC-135W aircraft with the callsign &quot;Redeye6&quot; tried to proceed in the direction of Donbass, but unexpectedly turned around and headed in the opposite direction, quickly interrupting its flight. The second board with the call sign &quot;Jake11&quot; conducted a reconnaissance mission only near the borders of Belarus.<br /><br />#russia #uswarplanes #airdefensesystem #russiaukraine #ukrainerussia #usarussia #russiausa #us #s400 #s300 #usplanes #f35 #russianairdefense{% endraw %}
