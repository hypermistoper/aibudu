Dembele has just 48 hours to decide his Barcelona future as the club consider selling the forward rather than risk losing him for nothing at the end of the season.<br /><br />The 24-year-old Frenchman has been in talks over a new deal, and he has had a new contract offer on the table for a number of weeks.<br /><br />The former Borussia Dortmund forward is reportedly keen to stay at the Nou Camp, but hesitant over what is a reduced deal.Barca are not currently in a position to offer Dembele an improved contract due to their salary mass.  <br /><br />Dembele has reportedly demanded a 'crazy' salary package worth up to €80million (£66.9m).<br /><br />According to Florian Plettenberg, manager Xavi Hernandez was 'nearly speechless' when he got informed that Dembele is demanding around £700,000 a week.<br /><br />However, Dembele's agent Moussa Sissoko stressed that the impasse was not down to financial disagreements, but instead as a result of Barcelona manager Xavi's poor management style, which he openly criticised last week.<br /><br />Dembele originally joined Barcelona in 2017 from German side Borussia Dortmund for £96million.<br /><br /><br /><br />Since making the move to Spain, the Frenchman has struggled to maintain fitness and live up to the hefty price-tag, making just 87 La Liga appearances at the club with only six starts so far this season.Dembele is out of contract at the end of this season and already able to agree a pre-contract agreement with any club outside of Spain.<br /><br />He has now been given 48 hours to decide on the current contract offer, according to Mundo Deportivo.<br /><br />If he decides to turn down the offer, Barcelona will begin to shop the talented youngster during the January transfer window.<br /><br />There is expected to be significant interest in the wide forward, who is capable of playing on either flank due to his two-footed ability.<br /><br />There have already been rumours of a possible return to Germany for Dembele with reported links to Bayern Munich, and English clubs Chelsea and Tottenham keeping a close eye on his situation out in Spain. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br
