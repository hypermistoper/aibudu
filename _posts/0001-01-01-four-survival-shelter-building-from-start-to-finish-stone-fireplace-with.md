{% raw %}This video is about four shelters with Stone fireplace and chimney that would be built from start to finish<br />I've built on my trips and stayed there!<br /><br />I hope you will like the video and enjoy it!!<br /><br /><br />I want to be a part of nature, not a spectator who just comes to visit. Not a tourist because we are all tourists in nature. People visit nature but are not part of it. Being a part of nature means being completely naked, without modern technology, with nothing, a true human animal in the wild. We have lost our ability to live like this in nature, so we have to apply technologies that make us tourists in nature. But if we relearn old skills, we can go out into nature and become one with that environment, a part of it. Only then will we become human again!<br /><br />Subscribe to my channel so that you wont miss any adventures of me!<br /><br />Have fun by watching!<br /><br />Follow me on<br />Insagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bushcraft.gr/?hl=el">https://www.instagram.com/bushcraft.gr/?hl=el</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/dinos.d.b">https://www.facebook.com/dinos.d.b</a><br />Twitter:      <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BushcraftGr">https://twitter.com/BushcraftGr</a><br /><br />Mailbox for my fans:<br />BUSHCRAFT GR<br />P.O.
