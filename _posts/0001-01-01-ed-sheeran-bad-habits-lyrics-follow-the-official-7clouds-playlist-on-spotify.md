Bad Habits <br /><br />[Intro]<br />(One, two, three, four)<br />Ooh, ooh<br /><br />[Verse 1]<br />Every time you come around, you know I can't say no<br />Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control<br />I can feel the paradise before my world implodes<br />And tonight had something wonderful<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone<br />Conversations with a stranger I barely know<br />Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't<br />I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do<br />My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space<br />And I know I lose control of the things that I say<br />Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape<br />Nothin' happens after two, it's tru–µ, it's true<br />My bad habits lead to you<br /><br />[Post-Chorus]<br />Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh<br />My bad habits lead to you<br />Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh<br />My bad habits l–µad to you<br />[Verse 2]<br />Every pure intention ends when the good times start<br />Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark<br />It started under neon lights and then it all got dark<br />I only know how to go too far<br /><br />[Chorus]<br />My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone<br />Conversations with a stranger I barely know<br />Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't<br />I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do<br />My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space<br />And I know I lose control of the things that I say<br />Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape<br />Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true<br />My bad habits lead to you<br /><br />[Post-Chorus]<br />Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh<br />My bad habits lead to you<br />Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh<br /><br />[Bridge]<br />We took the long way 'round<br />And burned 'til the fun ran out, now<br />[Chorus]<br />My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone<br />Conversations with a stranger I barely know<br />Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't<br />I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do<br />My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space<br />And I know I lose control of the things that I say<br />Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape<br />Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true<br />My bad habits lead to you<br /><br />[Post-Chorus]<br />Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh<br />My bad habits lead to you<br />Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh<br />My bad habits lead to you<br /><br />.........<br />üì∑ Wallpaper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unsplash.com/">https://unsplash.com/</a><br />.........<br />üìß Contact / Demo Submissions: contact@7clouds.org<br />.........<br />üíå Demos / Music Submissions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com">https://7clouds.edmdistrict.com</a><br />.........<br />üìù Licensing / Sync Requests: licensing@7clouds.org<br />.........<br /><br />#EdSheeran #BadHabits #Lyrics{% endraw %}
