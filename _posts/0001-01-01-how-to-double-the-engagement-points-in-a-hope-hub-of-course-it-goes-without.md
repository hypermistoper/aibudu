{% raw %}Of course it goes without saying that modifying any bike part is risky and you'll definitely void any warranty. As mentioned in the video a steel freehub body is highly recommended but even then please consider this a risky thing to do and you do so solely at your own risk. <br /><br />Disclaimers done, I mentioned that the Hope hub on my fatbike was modified to give double the engagement points a few weeks ago and since then every video has had comments asking when I'd make the video showing how it's done.<br /><br />Well the wait is over, Adam and I had some free time and we went to work not only showing the engagement mod but also how to double up the springs for a louder hub too.<br /><br />Don't forget to enter both competitions, you can follow tartybikes instagram here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tartybikes/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/tartybikes/?hl=en</a><br /><br />Info on Adam's refugee bike event: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1036294160642935&amp;set=a.1036294780642873">https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=1036294160642935&amp;set=a.1036294780642873</a><br /><br />As mentioned in the video, Tartybikes is a great place to get anything Trials related but don't be afraid to get in touch regarding any other bike related products too, they'd be happy to help, can do fast international shipping and I'd love to see them supported as Adam and the guys really are awesome people.<br /><br />www.tartybikes.co.uk<br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />See you next week!<br /><br />Patreon <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/aliclarkson">https://www.patreon.com/aliclarkson</a><br /><br />Instagram @aliclarkson<br /><br />Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aliclarkson.com/">https://aliclarkson.com/</a><br /><br />Paypal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/AliClarksonGB?locale.x=en_GB">https://paypal.me/AliClarksonGB?locale.x=en_GB</a><br /><br />Sponsors: Inspired Bicycles <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.inspiredbicycles.com/">https://www.inspiredbicycles.com/</a> <br />Tartybikes tartybikes.com/ <br />Ride Concepts Shoes <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rideconcepts.com/">https://rideconcepts.com/</a> <br />Light Bicycle Carbon Rims https:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/lightbicycle_ac">https://bit.ly/lightbicycle_ac</a> <br />Industry Nine <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://industrynine.com/">https://industrynine.com/</a> <br />ODI grips <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://odigrips.com/">https://odigrips.com/</a> <br />Rimpacts Tyre Inserts <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rimpactmtb.com/">https://www.rimpactmtb.com/</a> <br />MIX Hydration <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mxitup.com/">https://mxitup.com/</a> <br />HKT frame protection and mudguard <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hktproducts.co.uk/collections/hkt-ali-clarkson-collab">https://www.hktproducts.co.uk/collections/hkt-ali-clarkson-collab</a><br /><br />#hubmod #aliclarkson #bike #mtb{% endraw %}
