{% raw %}Stop Whining Start Grinding  | Toughen Up  |  Motivational Subliminal  |  Binaural + Isochronic<br /><br />Featuring RSDTyler &amp; Eric Thomas<br /><br /><br />This video contains a powerful combination of binaural beats &amp; isotonic tones (6Hz) designed to put you in a state of deep meditation and hypnosis, where your subconscious mind is more receptive to subliminal commands.
