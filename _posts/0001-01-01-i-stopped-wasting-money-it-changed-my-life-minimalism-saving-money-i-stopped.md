{% raw %}I Stopped Wasting Money &amp; It Changed My Life | Minimalism + Saving Money<br />I sharing how minimalism changed my life. I've lived a minimalist life for 13 years, and something unexpected happened. Minimalism impacted my life more than just saving money and buying less things. My minimalist lifestyle shaped how I saw the world and myself. Yes, of course I saved money, stopped wasting money, and broke my shopping habit. I'm sharing how when I changed my money habits with money everything was different. Living minimally let me live a full life.<br /><br />minimalism, minimalist, money saving, minimalist money habits, stop shopping, money habits, minimalist lifestyle, minimalism money, live minimally, Connie Riet Minimalist<br /><br />#Minimalism #Minimalist #SavingMoney #ConnieRiet<br /><br />Silver Necklace  Double Rings.  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Uw0Ydo">https://amzn.to/2Uw0Ydo</a><br />Women's casual baggy linen pant <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2YJxyKU">https://amzn.to/2YJxyKU</a><br />Max Studio Linen Midi skirt with buttons <br />Linen button up shirt. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3E2naxZ">https://amzn.to/3E2naxZ</a><br />Women's woven straw sun hat <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3nxtx6P">https://amzn.to/3nxtx6P</a><br />Women white linen tunic  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3oD5Bxz">https://amzn.to/3oD5Bxz</a><br /><br />Iâ€™m a certified life coach who specializes in mindfulness, meditation, and intentional living.
