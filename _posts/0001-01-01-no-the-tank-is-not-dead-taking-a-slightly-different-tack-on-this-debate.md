{% raw %}Taking a slightly different tack on this debate. There has been much focus in recent years on the ability of various systems like drones and sensor-fuzed artillery to destroy tanks. Some have observed that the tank has been declared 'dead' several times, going back as far as 1919. In this video, I attempt to explain why the tank still has a place on the modern battlefield, even if it takes more work and money to keep them alive.<br /><br />Original video by Perun. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUyAPQEb01Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUyAPQEb01Q</a><br />Military History Visualized's video on the repeated deaths of the tank <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPth_xqBXGY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPth_xqBXGY</a><br /><br />Merchandise (The carousel below seems dodgy)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://the-chieftains-retail-hatch.creator-spring.com/">https://the-chieftains-retail-hatch.creator-spring.com/</a><br /><br />Public facebook page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheChieftainArmor">https://www.facebook.com/TheChieftainArmor</a><br /><br />Financial donations:<br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/The_Chieftain">https://www.patreon.com/The_Chieftain</a><br />Direct Paypal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/thechieftainshat">https://paypal.me/thechieftainshat</a>{% endraw %}
