{% raw %}Steve Chapman shines a light on his inner critic - that whisper in his ear that constantly tells him he isn’t good enough and that he should never try anything new or risk making a fool of himself.<br /><br /><br /><br />Steve tells the story of how a personal experience of failure led him to begin an MI5 style investigation into his inner critic and how he has used a variety of experimental and creative means to learn to dance with it, rather than do battle with it. <br /><br />Explores the deeper recesses of personality, and talks about his relationship with his own ‘inner critic’ and self-doubt. Using creative practices, gestalt principles and mask work, he shows us that our identity and sense of self isn’t as fixed as we may believe. By learning to dance with his inner critic, rather than fight it, he has been able to notice and understand things he wasn't aware of, and in doing so, liberate more of his own creative ambitions.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
