{% raw %}After our last trail run out on the rocks with Pippi, our stock Jeep JL Wrangler 2-Door Sport, Cindy and I decided that it was finally time to buy her a new set of tires. But then came the real question of - what tires should we get? Rubicon take offs? A new set of mud terrains like always? Or, maybe something a bit more street friendly like a set of all terrains? In this video, you'll get to see what we ultimately decided to buy and why.<br /><br />Come join our online community at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://WAYALIFE.com">https://WAYALIFE.com</a><br /><br />Help Support WAYALIFE<br />BUY a CB BAR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2K7kIv6">https://bit.ly/2K7kIv6</a><br />BUY a JL Air Compressor Mount: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2SKOREe">https://bit.ly/2SKOREe</a><br />BUY a Hitch STINGER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Zh4hCL">https://bit.ly/2Zh4hCL</a><br />SHOP OUR AMAZON STORE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/wayalife">https://www.amazon.com/shop/wayalife</a><br /><br />#jeep #wrangler #jeepwrangler #jlwrangler #wranglerjl #jljeep #jeepjl #gladiator #jeepgladiator #gladiatortruck #jeepjt #jtjeep #jeepgladiator #wayalife #tires #offroadtires #mudterrain #allterrain #hybridtire #nitto #ridgegrappler #dailydriver #discounttire{% endraw %}
