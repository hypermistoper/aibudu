{% raw %}In looking at the results that we got at the track with our Catch-Can (we filled it up much more quickly than we expected), we ended up taking a pretty thorough look at the Subaru PCV system to try to figure out what might have happened to give us our result.<br /><br />And in the process of breaking down the stock lines, and trying to figure out how and why everything was connected, not only did we learn a lot, but we realized that the factory Subaru PCV system was a lot more complex that we originally thought. <br /><br />So we decided to put together a video going over the whole EJ257 PCV system in detail so that you can hopefully have a better picture of what exactly is going on with the stock system, and what the best way to modify it might be.<br /><br />Here are the topics of this video:<br /><br />00:00 - Introduction to the Subaru PCV system<br />01:04 - What are the 3 main circuits that make up the stock PCV system?<br />01:27 - Details about the balance circuit that connects the crankcase to the valve covers<br />02:27 - Details about the circuit that connects the valve covers to the turbo inlet<br />02:57 - Details about the circuit from the top of the factory AOS to the turbo inlet<br />04:03 - Now we know what circuits make up the PCV system, and where the PCV valve comes into play<br />04:32 - A detailed look at the valve covers and the factory air oil separator system<br />05:50 - How the oil pan itself is part of the factory air oil separator system<br />07:23 -  Having a better understanding of how the PCV system works will help us have a better idea of how to improve it<br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.flatironstuning.com/">https://www.flatironstuning.com/</a>{% endraw %}
