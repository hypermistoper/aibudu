Thatâ€™s how Iâ€™d describe this night out on the boulevard. What up yâ€™all? Thanks for stopping by for todayâ€™s video and as I mentioned, this one took place out in the 818 valley on Van Nuys Boulevard.<br /><br />Rain didnâ€™t stop this cruise cuz everyone was out and about. Well it wasnâ€™t pouring but it wasnâ€™t all that light either. But that was a minor annoyance that quickly stopped not too long after I arrived to the scene.<br /><br />Right after finding a parking spot in a 7 eleven lot, hopper set up right there to get down! Thatâ€™s how the video starts and sets up the rest of the night. This cruise was hosted by Individuals Car Club. Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
