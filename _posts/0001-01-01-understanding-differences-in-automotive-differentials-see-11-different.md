{% raw %}See 11 different types of automotive differentials and learn how they work. This video is intended for students in the AUSV 1220 Manual Drivetrain class at Weber State University with Professor John D. Kelly. <br /><br />CORRECTIONS:<br />1. The differential I called a &quot;Detroit Locker&quot; is not a Detroit Locker. It is just an Eaton Posi Limited Slip differential. A Detroit Locker uses dog teeth and is a truly locking differential. Thank you goes out to Keith MacDonald for catching my error.<br />2. I did not adequately explain how the clutch packs of a limited-slip differential are applied. The simple rotation of the side gears versus the differential pinion gears does not cause clutch packs to apply, otherwise, the clutches would apply when turning corners at low load (low torque). Torque from the engine (or another propulsion source) is necessary. The more torque you supply to the differential side gears the higher the force on the angled (ramped) teeth, the higher the force on the clutch packs. Thank you to several viewers for pointing out my omission.<br />3. There is more than one style of Torsen differential. See the JTEKT Corporation's website for more information <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jtekt.co.jp/e/products/lsd.html">https://www.jtekt.co.jp/e/products/lsd.html</a>  <br />4. I incorrectly described the operation of the original 1956 Dana limited-slip differential. The pinion pins on the original Dana differential have tapered ends. The pins sit in four V-shaped ramps in the differential case. Under a load, the differential case applies rotational torque to the pinion pins causing them to slide up the V-shaped ramps. This action applies outward force to the side gears and the clutch packs.
