{% raw %}x-linked inheritance and male pattern baldnessAn x-linked trait is a trait found on the x chromosome.<br />Females have two x chromosomes and males have an x and a y chromosome.<br />The x chromosome has almost 800 genes compared to only around 70 found on the y chromosome.<br /><br />Let’s look at the Punnett Square for another x-linked disease, hemophilia<br />In this example, the father has the disease and the mother is a carrier.<br />With a recessive x-linked disease a female can be a carrier<br />Have the disease, or not have the disease.<br />Males can only have the disease or not.<br />Let’s go back to the Punnett square and their offspring.<br />This female is a carrier, this female has the disease, this male has not inherited the disease and this male has hemophilia.<br />Notice the Punnett square works similar to a monohybrid cross except the y is neither dominant or recessive. I will call  the y chromosome neutral<br />Because males either have the disease or not, they have a greater chance of inheriting an x-linked trait.<br />So there you go, traits found on the x chromosome.{% endraw %}
