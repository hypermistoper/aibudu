{% raw %}This talk was given at a local TEDx event, produced independently of the TED Conferences. Anna Verhulst (23) is a fifth year medical student at Maastricht University, doing her internship in Eindhoven. She has a particular interest in the fields of oncology and sports medicine, but isnâ€™t quite sure yet what kind of doctor she wants to become when she graduates in 2016. <br /><br />Anna is a keen writer, sharing her experiences as a junior intern through columns, essays and opinion pieces. A selection of her publications can be found at annaverhulst.blogspot.nl. In between her internships, she is also involved in a research project that explores the possibilities of exercise rehabilitation in cancer survivors.<br /><br /><br /><br />On stage at TEDx Maastricht 2014, Anna will share a story that she has purposely kept silent for a long time. It is a story that has nothing to do with her work as a medical student, researcher or writer. It is her personal story, for which she has finally worked up the courage to share it with the public.<br /><br /><br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tedxmaastricht.nl">http://tedxmaastricht.nl</a><br /><br />Flickr: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/tedxmaastricht">https://www.flickr.com/photos/tedxmaastricht</a><br /><br />Facebook:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TEDxMaastricht">https://www.facebook.com/TEDxMaastricht</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TEDxMaastricht">https://twitter.com/TEDxMaastricht</a><br /><br />About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
