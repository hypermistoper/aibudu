Pluto’s degradation has left us in a crisis<br />Ruining all of our mnemonic devices <br />“My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine…What?! (what, what, what)<br />Now I’m spending Saturdays hanging out with my son<br />Writing angry letters to Neil Degrasse Tyson:<br />“Why do I need science when I’ve got my gut?<br />You stinky butt?”<br /><br />Heaven’s renamed<br />With Pluto’s new class<br />Couldn’t clear it’s domain<br />Of comparable mass<br />Had a long regime<br />But it’s off the team<br /><br />We don’t talk about Pluto, no, no, no<br />We don’t talk about Pluto<br /><br />This textbook was up-to-date<br />The next day: wrong! (no, no!)<br />They said that it was a dwarf planet all along! (no, no!)<br />And now I’m questioning the moon landing with Neil Armstrong! (No, no!)<br />This hurts as bad as losing Alderaan <br /><br />They told me that we all could agree that the planets would always be nine<br />Now you tell me, who’s gonna tell Hades, that his planet was forced to resign<br /><br />Oy vey this isn’t Pluto’s day!<br /><br />You tell me, when I hear “actually, there’s only eight bodies, considered to be planets!”<br />I’m just supposed to nod<br />(Hey this - makes me want to pound the crap out of you)<br />I’m just supposed to nod!<br />I’m supposed to nod!<br /><br />Um, Pluto<br />Yeah about that Pluto<br />I need you as a planet, Pluto<br />Don’t want the truth, I just want you, Pluto!<br /><br />Oh hey fellas that nutjob’s here<br />What a winner{% endraw %}
