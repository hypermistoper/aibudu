{% raw %}An Often Overlooked Keystep Feature!<br /><br />Today we're looking at an often overlooked Keystep feature. Present on both the Keystep and Keystep 37, &quot;Kbd Play&quot; is a function that allows you improvise over the top of a running sequence, given that you have at least a two voice polyphonic synth. This makes workshopping melodic ideas incredibly simple, as you can do anything from sequencing a bassline to work on melodies on top, to sequencing chords to play around with basslines underneath! Let me know how you use keyboard play, and enjoy the video :)<br /><br />GEAR IN THIS VIDEO<br />Arturia Keystep: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3waimVR">https://amzn.to/3waimVR</a><br />Synthstrom Deluge: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://synthstrom.com/product/deluge/">https://synthstrom.com/product/deluge/</a><br />Zoom Livetrak L-12 (audio recorder): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3MUBtck">https://amzn.to/3MUBtck</a><br /><br />Questions?
