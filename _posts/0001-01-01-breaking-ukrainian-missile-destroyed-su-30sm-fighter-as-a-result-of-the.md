{% raw %}As a result of the impact of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, the Su-30SM fighter was destroyed.<br /><br />Sources report that a Su-30SM fighter was destroyed as a result of an attack by the Ukrainian military using the Tochka-U tactical missile system. This is allegedly confirmed by a published photograph showing a fourth-generation combat aircraft on fire.<br />In the presented photo, you can see the consequences of the strike by the Ukrainian military using the Tochka-U OTRK. The strike was delivered in the morning, while the destruction of the fighter was refuted, but, judging by the available documentary data, at least one Su-30SM combat aircraft was destroyed.<br />Moreover, netizens drew attention to the fact that the Su-30SM fighter had a canopy raised, which may indicate that a pilot was in it at the time of the strike, but no official statements have been made in this regard so far.<br /><br />At the moment, it remains unknown whether the fighter was damaged precisely by the strike of the Tochka-U tactical ballistic missile or by the fire that started as a result of the strike. No comments were received on how critical the damage to the fighter was.<br /><br />A little earlier it became known that a Su-27 fighter was shot down near Kiev.{% endraw %}
