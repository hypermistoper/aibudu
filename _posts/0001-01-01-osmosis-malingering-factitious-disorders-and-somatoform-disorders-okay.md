{% raw %}Okay, back to our cases.<br /><br />Celia is a 5 year old girl that is brought in by her mother after an episode of loss of consciousness.<br /><br />This is probably related to the fact that she has hypoglycemia, which improved after glucose administration.<br /><br />An important clue is that despite exhaustive studies, no cause of hypoglycemia is found, which should already be a red flag for factitious disorder imposed on another.<br /><br />The next morning, Celia has another unexplained episode of hypoglycemia.<br /><br />This, along with the high blood insulin levels but low C-peptide, which remember should normally be found in equal amounts to insulin, should make you suspect that the mother is inducing hypoglycemia on Celia by injecting exogenous insulin.<br /><br />So, that’s a case of factitious disorder imposed on another, which means that you should contact child protective services immediately.<br /><br />After Celia, you see 32 year old Sofia, who presents with chest pain and is convinced that she's having a heart attack.<br /><br />However, an important clue is that both cardiac auscultation and ECG are normal.<br /><br />The most important clue is that she has repeatedly presented with the same unexplained symptoms, combined with the fact that she doesn’t get convinced by the negative workup.<br /><br />So this is a classic case of somatic symptom disorder.{% endraw %}
