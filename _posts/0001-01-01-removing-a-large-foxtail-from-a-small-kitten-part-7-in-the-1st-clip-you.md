{% raw %}In the 1st clip you see that on intake, our shelter techs offered first aid, and while cleaning the eye, found a foxtail embedded in the eye!  With careful removal and follow-up medication, Cougar was comfortable once again, and the eye healed wonderfully. We are guessing that he is about 2 months old.  Cougar is as friendly as they come: he always greets you with a gentle purr and an outstretched, soft paw.  He is sociable and easygoing and ready to find love. the 3nd one is right after bath doing the snoozy type, but just be careful, the smile might melt your heart. 3rd and last one is a baby human, cute and small as he has ever been, be sure to be cautious as you watch it, cuteness overload.<br /><br />For more of Mayra jhuana Cruz, check her out for more here:<br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdSqBaXe/">https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdSqBaXe/</a><br /> <br /><br />Note: All Videos Here On This Channel Have Been Allowed To Be Uploaded On It(except Commentary, it's Original And Added By Me With My Own Voice)<br /><br />Love Animals?
