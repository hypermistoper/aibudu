{% raw %}Ghana's $2.6 billion Accra SkyTrain Project - Will the ambitious project ever be realized? During the 2019 African Investment Forum in South Africa, Ghana's president, Nana Akufo-Addo, proudly announced that a SkyTrain would be constructed in Accra, the capital of Ghana to improve the lives of citizens. He welcomed the project signing as &quot;a happy day for Ghana and her good people.&quot; This flagship project was going to add handsomely to a growing list of innovations transforming the face of Africa; Finally, Africa, too, will have a SkyTrain! And Ghana was to build the African continent's first elevated light rail service.<br />SkyTrains are elevated air-propelled light rail systems that use rails and steel wheels on an elevated runway to reduce drag and maximize energy efficiency. The Accra SkyTrain is envisioned as a fully automated, elevated light train metro network designed to serve Accra city in Greater Accra, Ghana.  The network will consist of five routes, four of which will be radial routes that will launch at a new terminus at the Kwame Nkrumah Interchange and one that would loop around the city center. The overall track length of all routes combined is 194 kilometers.<br /><br />Use this affiliate link for your purchases at #MIZIZI International -<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3hajEY9">https://bit.ly/3hajEY9</a><br />Support our channel -<br />PayPal: newafricachannel(at)outlook.com<br />Follow us on Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thenewafricachannel/">https://www.instagram.com/thenewafricachannel/</a><br />Follow us on Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TheNewAfricaCh1">https://twitter.com/TheNewAfricaCh1</a><br />Join us on Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thenew.africachannel.3">https://www.facebook.com/thenew.africachannel.3</a><br /><br />This presentation contains images that were used under the  Fair Use Policy and Creative Commons License.<br /><br />For copyright matters relating to this video or channel, please contact us directly, and we'll remove any video on request: newafricachannel(at)outlook.com<br /><br />#Ghana #Accra #GhanaSkyTrain #AccraSkyTrain #GhanaNews #Ghana Projects #SkyTrain{% endraw %}
