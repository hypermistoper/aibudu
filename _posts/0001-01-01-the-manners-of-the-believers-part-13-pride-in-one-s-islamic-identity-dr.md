{% raw %}About this year's Ramadan series, &quot;The Manners of the Believer.&quot; <br /><br />Each day, I will discuss one mannerism or characteristic that is essential in building our character as righteous worshippers of Allah, and the goal will be that each one of us should examine ourselves and see how we can improve in that aspect.<br /><br />As our Prophet (SAW) said, 'I have only been sent to perfect good manners,' hence it can be stated that the main goal of our faith is to have the best akhlāq and to embody prophetic mannerisms.<br /><br />May this Ramaḍān be our best Ramaḍān ever, and may we draw closer to Allah with both our rituals and our manners!<br /><br />Date: April 12th, 2022<br />Location: East Plano Islamic Center, TX<br /><br />Please LIKE, COMMENT, &amp; SHARE!<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />► Credits:<br /><br />*Note: No musical instruments were used in this video, all background noise is human acapella.*<br /><br />© Intro Nasheed ©<br />Artist: Ibraheem Bakeer<br />Produced by: MAQAMAT INSTITUTION<br />*Copyright Reserved* and Reproduced Exclusively With Permission for Yasir Qadhi's Official YouTube Channel.<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> <br />► Shaykh Dr. Yasir Qadhi - Official Social Media Pages<br /><br />Facebook: facebook.com/yasirqadhi<br />Instagram: instagram.com/yasir.qadhi<br />Twitter: twitter.com/yasirqadhi<br />Snapchat: snapchat.com/add/yasir.qadhi<br /> <br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> <br />© Shaykh Dr. Yasir Qadhi - Official YouTube Channel{% endraw %}
