{% raw %}Payment Gateway is a software used by ecommerce website to help buyer make payment online. It is usually integrated with a payment ingestion and payment processing unit. In this video I have talked about how card payment works, how 3D secure card payment works, how will you design your own system like Razorpay, Paypal etc. High level software design of payment gateway has been discussed here along with relevant APIs which each service will use.<br />Payment is a very big domain hence capturing each details in one video is tough and same goes for system design interview or coding interview.
