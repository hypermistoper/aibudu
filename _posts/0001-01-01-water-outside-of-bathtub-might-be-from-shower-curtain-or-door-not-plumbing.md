I'm sure some of you wonder why I even bother making a video like this, but for those who are wondering why there's water on your bathroom floor at either ends of the bathtub, thinking it might be a broken water pipe or drain pipe, but it isn't, then hopefully by the time you finish watching this video you might have a solution to your problem. If shower doors and curtains aren't closed all the way, it could cause water to settle on the bathroom floor.{% endraw %}
