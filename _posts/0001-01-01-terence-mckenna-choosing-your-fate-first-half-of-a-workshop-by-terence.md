{% raw %}First half of a workshop by Terence McKenna on ethnobotany.<br />Art by Ronald Feghali <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ronaldfeghaliart">https://www.instagram.com/ronaldfeghaliart</a><br />&quot;You are choosing to sit here doing this, you're choosing to play botanist, ethnopharmacologist, American citizen, father, lover. You're choosing to do all this, it's okay to choose to do it but you are choosing to do it, it is not a fate, you aren't set into it, you could right now, just get up quietly and walk toward the green and keep moving.&quot; <br />Workshop from 1984.{% endraw %}
