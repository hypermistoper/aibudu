It is the second installment in the Five Nights at Freddy's series. Similar to its predecessor, the game takes place in a fictional pizza restaurant, where the player acts as a security guard who must defend themselves from hostile animatronic characters that roam within the restaurant.<br /><br />Cawthon first teased the game in September 2014, just one month after the release of the first game. It was released on Steam on November 11, 2014, earlier than its planned release date of December 25, 2014. Mobile ports of the game were released for Android and iOS were released on November 12, 2014, and November 20, 2014, respectively, and ports for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were released on November 29, 2019.<br /><br />The game received mostly positive reviews from critics, who praised its panic-inducing gameplay but criticized its difficulty in comparison to its predecessor. <br /><br />scary games,scary moments,scariest game ever,scary,horror,gameplay,reactions,screams,screaming,scared,creepy,creepypasta,five nights at freddys,markiplier,markiplier horror,horror games,funny,scream,five nights,video games,free games,jumpscares, fnaf 2, five nights at freddy's 2{% endraw %}
