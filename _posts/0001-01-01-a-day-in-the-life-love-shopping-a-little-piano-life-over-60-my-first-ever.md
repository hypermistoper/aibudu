{% raw %}My first ever DAY IN THE LIFE! I turned 67 years old today- thank you for being here!! This week you are with me the entire day. Snow, coffee, Desi, shopping, playing keyboards, eating dinner and watching a movie, and dreaming back to spring and all the way to our bedtime. It was so much fun! I collaborated for my bday With The Baking Diva! I love her!  I talk about a question I got from lovely Babs, of Take Control Beauty! (I am doing a Q &amp; A for my Anniversary in March)<br />I HAD the best time telling you about the results of my MaeLove MoonGlow serum which to me is better than Retin A for my skin! I see a difference in my appearance and I am so excited. I have <br />I truly had a very happy week and I ever stop being amazed at the life that I love and the life I am building in my late 60's. I read your comments every week and you touch my heart..but you also inspire me. You make me feel not so alone in my feelings...my hope and dreams, my fears...my setbacks and triumphs. I am so grateful for you. I so wish I could sit down and talk with each and every one of you that would like to chat with me and Dez!<br />Please know I love to you the moon and back!<br />Susan &amp; Dez<br /><br />A diplomat is a man who always remembers a woman's birthday but never remembers her age.
