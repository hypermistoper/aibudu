{% raw %}On Monday, the cross-examination of Amber Heard began with questioning by Johnny Depp's attorney Camille Vasquez. Vasquez questioned Heard about a variety of incidents spoken of so far in Heard's testimony. <br /><br />Happening in court:<br />0:00 Day 16<br />19:40 Cross-examination of Amber Heard<br /><br />Actor Johnny Depp is suing ex-wife Amber Heard for $50 million for defamation in connection with Heard’s 2018 Washington Post op-ed, in which she spoke out about being the victim of domestic violence. Heard’s article did not specifically name Depp as her alleged abuser, but according to Depp’s lawsuit, it relied “on the central premise that Ms. Heard was a domestic abuse victim and that Mr. Depp perpetrated domestic violence against her.” Amber Heard is counter-suing Depp for $100 million. <br /><br />The defamation trial began Monday in Fairfax County Circuit Court in Virginia, with jury selection completing on the same day. There is a possibility of celebrity witnesses testifying, including James Franco and Elon Musk.
