{% raw %}We are finally revealing our 1950s SIP Hydroptic-6 Jig Borer! The SIP Jig borers have a signature optical measuring system and hold tolerances up to 1 micron (0.001mm), so it's no wonder the Switzerland made machines are often considered the holy grail of precision machining. In  today's era this vintage 1950s jig borer can even out perform machines of the modern world. In the video we share what a jig borer is, how it works and all the special tooling &amp; accessories we received with it. We hope you enjoy this walk-around and tour of our amazing SIP Hydroptic-6 Jig Borer.<br /><br />Join our channel:<br />We upload new videos every Friday at 5pm AEST!
