{% raw %}We head up to visit our new iXS team mate Sam Johnson aka the Kiing of Spades to see how his incredible bike park and dirt jump builds are going!  We shred the slopeduro bikes on the trails, smashing berms and high speed jumps then get the hardtail out for some dirt jumps and pump track in the afternoon! <br /><br />Filmed and Thumbnail by C A Greenwood<br />Extra footage: Bart{% endraw %}
