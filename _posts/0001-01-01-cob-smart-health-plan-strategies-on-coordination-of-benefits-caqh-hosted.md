{% raw %}CAQH hosted a webinar in September 2015, in concert with Kaiser Permanente and Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina (BCBSNC), to discuss how health plans can improve coordination of benefits (COB) through greater industry collaboration. For patients covered by more than one health plan, COB determines the primary and secondary insurers.<br /><br />Presenters discussed how an automated, shared solution can streamline benefits coordination. Access to a national registry with the most up-to-date and complete coverage information available helps industry stakeholders get COB right the first time.{% endraw %}
