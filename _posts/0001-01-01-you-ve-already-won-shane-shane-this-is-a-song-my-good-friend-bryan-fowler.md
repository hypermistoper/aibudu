{% raw %}This is a song my good friend Bryan Fowler and I wrote with our brothers and sisters in Ukraine in mind. We pray for you often beloved.  Your future is so bright in Christ! We know how the story ends. <br /><br />&quot;And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, 'Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away.' ”<br /><br />Revelation 21:3-4<br /><br />Lyrics: <br /><br />There’s peace that outlasts darkness<br />Hope thats in the blood<br />There’s future grace thats mine today<br />That Jesus Christ has won<br />So I can face tomorrow<br />For tomorrow’s in Your hands<br />All I need you will provide<br />Just like you always have<br /><br />I’m fighting a battle<br />That you’ve already won<br />No matter what comes my way<br />I will overcome<br />I don’t know what your doing<br />But I know what you’ve done<br />I’m fighting a battle that<br />You’ve already won<br /><br />There’s mercy in the waiting<br />Mana for today<br />And when it’s gone I know you’re not<br />You are my hope and stay<br />When the sea is raging<br />Your Spirt is my help<br />He’ll fix my eyes on Jesus Christ<br />And I’ll say that is well<br />Oh I know that it is well<br /><br />I know how the story ends<br />We will be with you again<br />You’re my Savior my defense<br />No More fear in life or death<br />I know how this story ends{% endraw %}
