{% raw %}Real Estate Investing, 9th grade dropout with 100 units shares all, brrr, landlord, flip.<br /><br />Learn things like mortgage selection for investing, questions about property rehab and doing a successful #BRRR. #REI lessons from an elite investor. Understand why real estate crisis and crash channels are wrong. Why @economicninja and @reventureconsulting are talking about market conditions that may be factually correct in some cases don't tell the whole story. <br /><br />Watch elite real estate brokers like @bryancasella and getting guys like him in your network so you are positioned to grow. And how to take much of what   @Dave Ramsey    says about real estate with grain of salt. <br /><br />Even though life is much different for   @Meet Kevin     and   @Graham Stephan    now. They got their starts in real estate. Their older videos are solid and can give you a good foundational knowledge of real estate. If you want current lessons from investors that are investing in the same assets you are, you wont fine better than   @One Rental at a Time    or   @Dion Talk Financial Freedom    . These are investors that still invest today. <br /><br />People that are looking to start investing in real estate today need to find mentors that are doing what they want to do.   @Ken McElroy     while being very wealthy, hasn't bought a small residential property in decades. He completely missed this years market when he called for a 40 percent correction and instead we saw over 20 percent growth. Yeah... The math says that was a 60 point swing.   @Reventure Consulting    has been talking crash for a year and other for years.... let me share with you the actual numbers... yes facts... not feelings, numbers, not charts...<br /><br />So have your questions ready... There is no dumb question. I am here to share my story and experience that will hopefully help you in your journey and entertain you along the way.{% endraw %}
