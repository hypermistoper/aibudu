{% raw %}How do you respond to those who believe that some lives are just not worth living?<br /><br />Watch this powerful conversation between Joni and Friends Founder, Joni Eareckson Tada, and friends of the ministry, Nick Vujicic and Katherine Wolf. <br /><br />Regardless of ability, all life is valuable. Whether found in a womb or in a wheelchair, every life has value because we are all made in the image of God!<br /><br />Read more from Joni Eareckson Tada: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.joniandfriends.org/true-quality-of-life/">https://www.joniandfriends.org/true-quality-of-life/</a><br /><br />…<br /><br />Sanctity of Life Sunday was established in 1984 to recognize the human dignity of unborn children. All these years later, it’s no longer only the unborn whose sanctity of life is questioned… it’s the elderly, those with catastrophic disabilities, people with psychiatric disorders, and more. There are even Christians who are questioning how and to what extent life is sacred. <br />___<br /><br />Joni and Friends envisions a world where every person with a disability finds hope, dignity, and their place in the body of Christ.<br /> <br />Become part of this global movement at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.joniandfriends.org">https://www.joniandfriends.org</a><br />___<br /> <br />Connect:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/joniandfriends">http://www.instagram.com/joniandfriends</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@joniandfriendsofficial">https://www.tiktok.com/@joniandfriendsofficial</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/JoniandFriendsIDC">http://www.facebook.com/JoniandFriendsIDC</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/JoniandFriends">http://www.twitter.com/JoniandFriends</a><br /><br />#SanctityOfLife #JoniEarecksonTada #NickVujicic #KatherineWolf #ImageOfGod{% endraw %}
