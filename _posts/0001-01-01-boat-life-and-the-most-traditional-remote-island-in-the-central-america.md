{% raw %}After an amazing weekend off we sail back to the mainland to use the internet to work and get provisions. Gabi enjoys her small victory. <br />We embark on another adventure to Tobacco caye, another remote island we have not been to before. The rough sail brings out a little frustration.<br />Dan starts to get nervous about the shallows again, so we decide to make a quick stop at Thatch caye.<br /><br />Thank you for following our voyage and welcome aboard!<br /><br />‚ô° Please subscribe to our channel, like, comment, and share our videos ‚ô°<br /><br />...<br /><br />üôè PATREON<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/sailourworld">https://www.patreon.com/sailourworld</a> - Please consider supporting us on Patreon for exclusive content and other benefits.<br /><br />...<br /><br />ü§≥ INSTAGRAM<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sailourworld/">https://www.instagram.com/sailourworld/</a> <br /><br />üë• FACEBOOK<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/twoSailOurWorld">https://www.facebook.com/twoSailOurWorld</a> <br /><br />‚úç BLOG<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sailourworld.com/">https://sailourworld.com/</a> - Read more about us and our trips on our website. <br /><br />‚Ä¶<br /><br />Created with love and laughter, <br />üíô Gabi &amp; Dan <br /><br />...<br /><br />Music:<br />Artlist<br /><br />...<br /><br />#sailing #living off-grid #travel vlog #tiny home{% endraw %}
