{% raw %}PROPOSAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN INTUITION ECOSYSTEM MODEL VALIDATION FOR ENHANCING GENERAL DECISION MAKING -INTUITION ECOSYSTEM MODEL: IEM<br />Antonio Jose Balloni, Unicamp, Institute of Economics - Neit, Brazil<br /><br />(Presented at the International Conference on Humanities, Social and Education Sciences (IHSES) April 21-24, 2022, Los Angeles, CA, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.2022.ihses.net/">https://www.2022.ihses.net/</a>  organized by International Society for Technology, Education and Science ((ISTES)-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.istes.org)">http://www.istes.org)</a><br /><br />This opinion paper presents an INTUITION ECOSYSTEM MODEL -IEM- and proposes developing a VALIDATION PROCESS FOR THIS IEM, an innovative proposal seeking to enhance Intuition in general decision making. The paper presents the road map to construct the validation process for the IEM, an interdisciplinary process involving understanding human beings' cognition, pattern recognition, and decision making. Our IEM is an adaptation from figure 1, reference [1], as Figure a): Figure a): The IEM is composed of the same cognitive units - D: Data, I: Information, K: Knowledge -t: tacit and e: explicit-, W: Wisdom -t: tacit and e: explicit- as reference1. In the IEM, we propose to construct, for each cognitive unit -DIKW-a set of questions that should provide the intuitive solution we are looking for when answered. The paper describes how to construct -a road map- and analyze the set of questioning -THE IEM VALIDATION PROCESS. This paper address how to construct the correct set of questioning -IEM VALIDATION PROCESS- for each cognitive unit D,I,K,W presented in figure a). Academics &amp; businesses workers must test this set of questions, which will apply according to their needs and interests. An analysis of the answers from each tester should guide intuition decision-making for the tester. No paper addresses this interdisciplinary research topic -IEM &amp; Validation Process- with a gamma of practical applications and an enhancer for Research &amp; Economics. The bottleneck of this opinion paper is its Intuition Ecosystem Model Validation -IEM- guaranteed by the best set of questioning associated with each cognitive unit. We propose a road map to progress towards these questions. Our IEM Validation intends to provide answers by its set of questions created for each cognitive unit from figure a). We propose how to construct and interpret such questionings -a road map-.<br /><br />PREPRINT paper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359852797_Proposal_for_the_Development_of_an_Intuition_Ecosystem_Model_Validation_for_Enhancing_General_Decision_Making_-Intuition_Ecosystem_Model_IEM">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/359852797_Proposal_for_the_Development_of_an_Intuition_Ecosystem_Model_Validation_for_Enhancing_General_Decision_Making_-Intuition_Ecosystem_Model_IEM</a><br /><br />#intuition #intuitiontest #intuition #intuitionwisdom{% endraw %}
