{% raw %}#HiFi #Audio #Stereo<br /><br />My Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.stevehuffphoto.com">http://www.stevehuffphoto.com</a><br />Instagram: @stevehuffofficial <br /><br />By request! I have had a few emails recently asking me what my top speakers are. I made this video today talking about my favorite hifi speakers of all time. I have owned probably 30 models in my lifetime and heard more than that. These are the speakers that left a memory with me, and a good one at that!<br /><br />These are the best speakers I have heard. I still own three of them! Yes I have heard top models from Magico, Wilson, Focal and others but these are the ones that spoke to me emotionally. All are tremendous and special music makers. <br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />Media Contact/Review Contact: stevehuff1@icloud.com{% endraw %}
