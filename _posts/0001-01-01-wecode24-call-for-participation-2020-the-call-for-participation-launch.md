{% raw %}The Call for Participation launch event took place on 25 November 2019 in Cape Town.<br /><br />WeCode24 is a Naspers initiative, in partnership with Media24 and the University of Stellenbosch. It is an after school programme for Grade 8 to 11 learners in under-resourced schools, that is about having serious fun while learning things that have tremendous real-world value. It is centred around computer programming, which is in high demand and can open up many possibilities for learners. But more than simply teaching a skill, we are about creating a culture where passion, curiosity and wonder are the drivers of learning. By doing this we aim to empower underprivileged high school students in South Africa to apply themselves creatively to their own unique contexts, and make an impact on the world with the things they are passionate about. <br /><br />The programme is aimed at under-resourced high schools and is offered free of charge. We invite such schools in the Cape Metropole and Boland areas who are interested in joining the programme in 2020, to contact us by no later than 15 January 2020. Application details can be found on www.wecode24.com{% endraw %}
