Seriously! It's 'ok' to have skin texture on your arms, your legs and your feet - but you should definitely NOT have any on the skin on your face! Good grief woman! Your face skin should look like glass! WTF GUYS!!! Why are we like this! Literally every single person on the PLANET has skin texture. Whether their pores are enlarged or small, whether they have fine lines or wrinkles when they smile - no one's skin is actually airbrushed in real life. No influencer or celebrity ACTUALLY looks like they do in edited pictures. If you have skin texture, you DON'T need to get rid of it, and you don't need to feel bad about it. It's society's attitude to beauty that needs to change - not you.{% endraw %}
