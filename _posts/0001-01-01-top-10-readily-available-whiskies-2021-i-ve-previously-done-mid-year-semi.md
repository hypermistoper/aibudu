{% raw %}I've previously done mid-year semi-available bourbon and rye lists, and finished the year with my top 10 single barrel/picks and rare/limited lists, now I wanted to turn to some products NOT on those lists, but readily on store shelves. My hope is these are available in most markets, but I understand not all are the same. <br /><br />For more of my content you can find me here: <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/abandonbourbon">http://instagram.com/abandonbourbon</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/abandoncoffee">http://instagram.com/abandoncoffee</a><br /><br /> You can also browse past barrel picks, photography galleries, and contact me at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://brianbeyke.com">http://brianbeyke.com</a> <br /><br />Want to support the channel and get exclusive perks for doing so?
