{% raw %}The fifty-fifth episode of Boss Analysis.<br /><br />There are bosses I have a distaste for, bosses I mildly dislike, bosses I hate, bosses I HATE, but only a select few will be fiendish enough to earn the coveted Bosses I REALLY HATE title. The dark purple flames of super-hell are reserved for only the worst of the worst!<br /><br />So, which bozo boss got under my skin enough to warrant such a honour? Well, it's actually one I covered before, albeit briefly back in Boss Analysis # 19. I didn't fully articulate exactly why I hated it so much.<br /><br />If you've ever dreamt about meeting aliens before, then allow me to enlighten you on why that would be a terrible, terrible idea....<br /><br />Boss Analysis playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmVdMZ2khLqBxBHm-eBzfQcE6zDIwl2Ut">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmVdMZ2khLqBxBHm-eBzfQcE6zDIwl2Ut</a>{% endraw %}
