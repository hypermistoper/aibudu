{% raw %}This is a live surgical video showing fluoroscopy and surgical removal of a simple BB from the finger. Foreign body removal, exploration, and washout are crucial in this area to prevent flexor tenosynovitis. Although the BB wasnt in the tendon sheath an infection in this area could have progressed to something much worse. The same management can be implemented with birdshot or other retained projectile.<br /><br />www.MPSurgery.com<br />www.Hand411.com{% endraw %}
