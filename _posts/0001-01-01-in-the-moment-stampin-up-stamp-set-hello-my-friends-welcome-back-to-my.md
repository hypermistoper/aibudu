{% raw %}Hello my friends, welcome back to my channel.  On Sunday night I used the brand new stamp set IN THE MOMENT.  This set will be released in January 2022.  You will find it in the upcoming January to June mini catalog.  <br /><br />I embossed the image and the sentiment using Versa Mark Ink and White embossing powder.  Then simply colored in using Stampin' Up's amazing watercolor pencils.  <br /><br />Enjoying watching and let me know if you have any questions. <br /><br />My shop link is <br />Beverleestamps.stampinup.net{% endraw %}
