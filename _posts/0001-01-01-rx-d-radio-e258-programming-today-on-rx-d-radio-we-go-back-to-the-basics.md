{% raw %}Today on RX’D Radio, we go back to the basics of programming. Jiunta and Shallow go over the framework of how they started programming and the things people tend to get away from. The simple sophisticated way usually works the best. Shallow brings in a great comparison to booking an Airbnb, once you start selecting criteria for a client you usually end up with a small selection of exercises that are perfect for them. <br /><br />Don’t miss the release of our NEWest educational community - The Pre-Script ™<br /> Collective!
