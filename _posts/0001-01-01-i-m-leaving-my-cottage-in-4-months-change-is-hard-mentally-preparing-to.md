{% raw %}mentally preparing to leave my cottage in 4 months - Change Is hard (Info at timestamp 8:49)<br /><br />MY ETSY SHOP ü¶ä üçÑ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/thecottagefairyart">https://www.etsy.com/shop/thecottagefairyart</a> <br />Thank you for the support!<br /><br />I guess I‚Äôve had a bit of a nervous week, it‚Äôs really hitting home that I will be leaving my cottage l in just 4 months. It‚Äôs crazy to think about, and while I am so happy to be potentially having a new home, change is SO HARD. It is freaking me out, but I am taking deep breaths. It‚Äôs funny how you can want two things at the same time: to change and grow, but also for things to stay the same forever. If you have not seen my previous videos, I am getting married and moving into a new home this year, after over 2 years at my cottage. So many mixed feelings, but it is also a wonderful reminder that I am alive to feel these emotions, and that is a beautiful gift. <br /><br />This video was a collaboration with my brother, Rohan. He has a channel now! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/rohan_merrill">https://linktr.ee/rohan_merrill</a><br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏èNo obligation whatsoever, but if you would like to donate to support this channel $5 will get a thank you postcard (my own art) from me in the mail (you must include address in your note so I can send it!).
