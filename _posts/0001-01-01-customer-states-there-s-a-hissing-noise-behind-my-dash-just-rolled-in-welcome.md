They had to get it towed not even 5 mins after.&quot; I'm guessing they never tightened the oil filter (that's what's missing) so it just screwed off. If they forgot it, it wouldn't have even left the place. <br />1:09 Mechanic said this was caused by a blown head gasket. <br />1:24 Mechanic said: &quot;The customer is denying it all and told me she bought a few days ago and it was vandalized but there are punctures all the way around the tires and you can see where the cops tried to smash the rear passenger window but couldn't.&quot; The mechanic's shop thinks that the customer got chased by the cops, and ran over a spike strip. But let us know what you think.<br />1:40 I won't say the name of the shop that performed this work but it starts with an M. But for $700, that exhaust should have looked pretty good! <br />1:53 The mechanic mentioned that the lug nuts were cross threaded on and he thinks that the customer did the brakes themselves. <br />2:06 2018 Cadillac Escalade with 15000 miles (24140 kilometres) on it. Look's like somebody might have cross-threaded the drain plug which broke the head off. <br />2:15 No more info.<br />2:23 Mechanic said: &quot;Vehicle was towed in dead as hell with all windows down an inch and horn blaring (when battery hooked back up). Apparently, there was a Tesla hit a few spots down so Iâ€™m guessing there were a few cars hurt from this.<br />Took 4 separate estimates to fix all concerns as some issues were unknown until others were repaired. An example is the rear ride height sensors were dead but I couldnâ€™t tell until the dead air suspension module was replaced and online. The real kicker is my second estimate was for the transmission module, the ABS module, and the power steering module. Too bad the TCM is built into the valve body and electric power steering module?â€¦the whole steering rack.&quot; - RAM 1500 (didn't mention what year).<br />2:29 Somebody's brakes got really hot which heated up the wheel. I've seen this happen before when customers drove in with a seized brake caliper.<br />2:36 As you approach about 80% of a single piece driveshafts max rpm you start to get primary bending from the shaft flexing. Where only one part of the shaft is bending.<br />As you run it past 100% of its rated speed the bend begins to bend and the driveshaft starts to take on a boomerang shape. This is called secondary bending. If it doesn't fail from running it that hard typically this is the result.<br />2:48 Looking online I found that these keys can cost anything from $800+ USD for a new one (OEM). Here is some more information about them if you want to read into it. - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bimmer-tech.net/blog/item/118-bmw-display-key">https://www.bimmer-tech.net/blog/item/118-bmw-display-key</a><br />2:57 Outro.
