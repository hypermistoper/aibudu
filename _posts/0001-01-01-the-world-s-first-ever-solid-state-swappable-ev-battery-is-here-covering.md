But going beyond just swappable batteries is Taiwanese company Gogoro who for the first time has brought out the first ever solid-state swappable battery and that is a big two in one deal because not only will it push forward the agenda of swappable batteries, it will make the trend even more powerful than ever.<br />Happy days for the EV market, swap your battery is now here<br />The EV battery market has never had it so good. Gone are the days when Tesla dominated everything from cars to batteries. With new start-ups and older tech companies churning out path breaking discoveries in electric battery tech, it‚Äôs a happy day for the electric consumer and the planet too. Gogoro is not a new name, they‚Äôve been around for eleven years, but what‚Äôs with this swapping business, can you actually swap a battery? Well, thanks to Gogoro apparently you can. It was Gogoro who way back in 2016 created a unique subscription based swappable battery platform initially for electric scooters, mopeds and motorcycles where riders could swap their discharged batteries at kiosks for newly charged ones and that is seriously music to the ears of any consumer. The trend took off from the word go and exploded into a market of 370, 000 riders as of April 2021. With over 175 million battery swaps under its belt, Gogoro was also awarded the 2020 Global Company of the Year Award.<br />Now a solid-state battery<br />But hey, no company ever stops at one do they, and Gogoro has been continuously researching new ways to further improve their impact on the EV industry and voila, their eureka moment has arrived. The company has now unveiled its first major milestone in the form of the world's first swappable solid-state EV battery. <br /><br />___________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />ü§© The Tesla Domain is the Number 1 channel to go when you want to be up to date with the latest Tesla news, rumors, and insights.
