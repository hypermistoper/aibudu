Oh, ooh<br />All I want is a good guy<br />Are my expectations far too high?<br />Try my best but what can I say?<br />All I have is myself at the end of the day<br />And all I want is for that to be okay<br /><br />Tags:<br />olivia rodrigo,olivia rodrigo all i want,all i want olivia rodrigo,all i want olivia rodrigo lyrics,olivia rodrigo lyrics,olivia rodrigo all i want lyrics,lyrics olivia rodrigo all i want,all i want lyrics olivia rodrigo,lyrics all i want olivia rodrigo,olivia rodrigo - all i want lyrics,all i want olivia rodrigo karaoke,olivia rodrigo - all i want,all i want olivia rodrigo karaoke acoustic,olivia rodrigo - all i want (sezin)<br /><br />#oliviarodrigo #alliwant #lyrics{% endraw %}
