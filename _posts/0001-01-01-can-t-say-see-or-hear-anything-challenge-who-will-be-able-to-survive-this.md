{% raw %}Who will be able to survive this challenge? It all started when Rebecca Zamolo created &quot;Clue Game in Real Life At Detention.&quot; Next Matt and Rebecca posted &quot;Last To Leave 24 Inch Circle Wins Tesla.&quot; The Game Master Network made &quot;Extreme Who's More Likely to Challenge.&quot; Now Daniel can't hear, Rebecca can't see and Matt can't talk. In order to finish the the challenge, they will have to work together. Do you think they can make it work or is this a bad idea?
