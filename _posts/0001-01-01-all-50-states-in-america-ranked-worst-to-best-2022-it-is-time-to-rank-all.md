{% raw %}It is time to rank all 50 states in the USA. Everyone has their favorite state and a state they aren't to keen on.<br />We did this video about 3 years ago and thought it was time for an update. <br />Some of the usual suspects were at the top and bottom of this list. Some states like West Virginia and California did some moving on where they are ranked.  This is a very interesting subject to me and I hope it is for you. <br />  The United States is an amazing country with beautiful people, land, and history.  The purpose of these videos is to teach people about all of it and maybe get a laugh.<br />  In order to determine how States are ranked, we look at a few categories including their economy, cost of living, crime rates, healthcare, schools, and overall reputation. <br /><br /><br />Other videos you might like:<br />► Oldest City in Each State- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/tqHxn38ylMI">https://youtu.be/tqHxn38ylMI</a><br />► Worst States to move to in 2022 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/H1g6iz-u-xU">https://youtu.be/H1g6iz-u-xU</a><br /><br />Join to help support this channel: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCecPJBL6E1PVky1-gj6KH5g/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCecPJBL6E1PVky1-gj6KH5g/join</a><br /><br /><br /><br />🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹<br /> 🔶My Other Channels: <br />    🟥  On This Day  <br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs9MGJ6xVKLKG_YsQkQNLjg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs9MGJ6xVKLKG_YsQkQNLjg</a><br />    <br />   Our website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.worldaccordingtobriggs.com/">https://www.worldaccordingtobriggs.com/</a><br />   <br /><br /><br />  <br />#UnitedStates<br />#All50States<br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />❤Things You should watch or listen to:<br />    Hermens Outdoors:<br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgEIwkmBTuhy6Djx6XipM3g">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgEIwkmBTuhy6Djx6XipM3g</a><br /><br />Caffeinated Humor Podcast:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/caffeinated-humor-sarcastic-comedy-for-the-masses/id1485476178">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/caffeinated-humor-sarcastic-comedy-for-the-masses/id1485476178</a><br /><br />  <br /><br />Business &amp; Voice over email: World2Briggs@gmail.com<br /><br />Mailing Address:   World According to Briggs<br />                                 20449 SW Tualatin Valley Hwy<br />                                 # 354<br />                                 Aloha, Oregon 97003{% endraw %}
