{% raw %}Beth (@JustBeingBeth) had asked me to do a Colouralong in the Dragonology coloring book on stream one day.   It can be a daunting book with TONS of details.  I’m hoping this will break it down a little and help it seem less daunting to color in!  This is a less detailed version, maybe in the future I’ll do another one SUPER detailed 🤪<br /><br />I’ve used Prismacolor premier for this image but feel free to use whatever pencils YOU have on hand!<br /><br />Book: Dragonology Coloring Book (Ologies) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/0763695300/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_i_ZY606APZHFA71G2Y8KQZ">https://www.amazon.com/dp/0763695300/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_i_ZY606APZHFA71G2Y8KQZ</a><br /><br />Pencils used:  Prismacolor Premier 150 set<br /><br />————<br /><br />Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.Instagram.com/ashleigh_maegan">http://www.Instagram.com/ashleigh_maegan</a><br /><br />Amazon Wish List: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1R60FAJ8U9U0C/?ref_=lol_ov_le">https://www.amazon.com/hz/wishlist/ls/1R60FAJ8U9U0C/?ref_=lol_ov_le</a>{% endraw %}
