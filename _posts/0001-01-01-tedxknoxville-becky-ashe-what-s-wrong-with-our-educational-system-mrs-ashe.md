{% raw %}Mrs. Ashe is the Principal of the new Knoxville STEM Academy: a unique, standalone magnet high school with an integrated focus on Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://choice.knoxschools.org">http://choice.knoxschools.org</a><br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)<br /><br />Video produced by Knox ivi  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://knoxivi.com">http://knoxivi.com</a>{% endraw %}
