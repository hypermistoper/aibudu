Dr Adrian Gill is a leading expert in wind turbine blades, the part of a turbine designed to extract energy from the wind. As Chief Engineer of Blades at Vestas, Adrian has dedicated his career to expanding the capabilities of blades, making them bigger, more efficient, and ready to support a world powered fully by renewable energy. Over the last 15 years, Adrian has seen the wind industry transform from a niche, highly subsidized energy source, to the most competitive source of power in the world where one turbine can power 20,000 homes. He has helped evolve wind energy technology to a point where it now supplies over a quarter of the UK’s electricity supply, and is rapidly growing across the world. Adrian firmly believes in the potential of wind energy to stop the world’s addiction to fossil fuels, and in paving the way for a more sustainable future.
