I’m originally from Iran, and I live and work in the U.K.<br /><br />I’m a qualified English teacher and teacher trainer, but that’s not what makes me good at my job. <br /><br />I just love teaching! It makes me feel good when I can share something I’ve learned with others. That’s why I still love teaching English after 40 years of doing it!<br /><br />English is such a vast and complicated language! My passion is to make it as easy as possible for others to learn. My students always praise my ‘clear explanations’ and 'structured method'. <br /><br />I suppose I can explain things well because I’m not a native speaker. I’ve struggled with English grammar, pronunciation, and vocabulary myself. I’ve had to work out the rules and learn the exceptions, and I just love sharing my own discoveries with others like me who are learning English as a foreign language.<br /><br />Thank you so much, everyone, for all the ‘likes’ and your lovely and supportive comments! I'm so grateful for your support!{% endraw %}
