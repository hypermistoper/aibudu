{% raw %}If you’re looking for a large estate car that combines value for money, quality and the most up-to-date tech, you’re going to have to go a long way to beat a Skoda Superb Estate. This estate version of the Superb has been around since 2015, but thanks to a facelift in 2018 and the introduction of a plug-in hybrid version known as the iV in 2020, this is a serious family car market contender.<br />If you want big, this car definitely delivers. Its size makes it a serious rival for the likes of the Audi A6 Avant, Mercedes-Benz E-Class Estate and the Volvo V90 and it competes with the Ford Mondeo Estate and Volkswagen Passat Estate on price.<br />Skoda have also added features to increase the car’s practicality, including the option of an electric tailgate which can be made to open with a wiggle of the foot under the rear bumper, closing again by giving a brief pull down on the door itself. Rear seats up, the Skoda Superb estate has 660 litres of luggage, shopping space, thats an increase of 27 litres over the previous version. Folding the rear seats down and the space increases to a whopping 1,950 litres, although we suggest you invest in the variable-height boot floor option to have a flatter load bed as the seat backs don’t fold totally flat.<br />The Skoda Superb’s driving experience is exactly what you’d expect from a car like this. It’s a comfortable motorway mile-eater, happy to soak up the imperfections of poor road surfaces and demanding very little from the driver in the process. Should you wish to press on a little the Superb will join in, and do a decent job of it.<br />There’s a choice of a 1.5-litre petrol engine with 148bhp or a 2.0-litre with either 187bhp or a huge 276bhp for the top-of the-range models, which also comes as all wheel drive. The diesel variants are a 2.0-litre 148bhp very fuel-efficient and reasonably powerful, helping if you're towing or carrying a full complement of passengers and luggage. It can be chosen on all trims and is worthwhile if your budget can stretch to it, with a 0-62mph time to 9.2 seconds and a top speed of 134mph. There’s also a 197bhp model bringing a 7.9-second 0-62mph time and a top speed of 146mph. Both of the latter engines offer around 56mpg on the efficiency level.<br />Safety wise, the car has been crash-tested by Euro NCAP and received the organisation’s full five-star rating. With a strong construction and long list of standard safety features, the Superb will protect you and your passengers well in a crash, while standard automatic emergency braking reduces the risk of that happening in the first place.<br /><br />THE PLAYER is the World's leading Men Only Bookazine (hard backed magazine), YouTube Channel and website.
