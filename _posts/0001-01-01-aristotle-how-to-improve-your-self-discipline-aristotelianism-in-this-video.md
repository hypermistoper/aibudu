He was first a student of Plato, then, when Plato retired, he left the Academia which Plato founded, and he became the tutor of Alexander The Great, and the two other future kings: Ptolemy and Cassander. He established a library in the Lyceum which helped him to produce many of his hundreds of books on papyrus scrolls. Unfortunately, only a third of his magnificent work has survived. For example, the  treatises “Physics”, “Metaphysics”, “Nicomachean Ethics”, “Politics”, “On the Soul” and “Poetics”, have influenced more than two millennia of scientists and theologians alike, both fascinated by his ideas. <br /><br />Research/Writing: Bianca-Adina Szasz<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://biancaszasz.com/">https://biancaszasz.com/</a><br /><br />Narration/Audio Editing: Dan Mellins-Cohen<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dmcvoiceovers.com">https://www.dmcvoiceovers.com</a><br /><br />Music: Enchanting Inspirational Music - Royalty Free - This Moment<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VObTSz0ufhQ</a><br /><br />Subscribe To Philosophies for Life<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCp1mRTkVlqDnxz_9S0YD9YQ</a>{% endraw %}
