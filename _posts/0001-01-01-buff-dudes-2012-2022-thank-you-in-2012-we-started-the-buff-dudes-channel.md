{% raw %}In 2012 we started the Buff Dudes channel with two simple rules: make it fun and make it consistent. We set a goal for ourselves: regardless of how busy our lives would get, we would write, shoot and edit one Buff Dudes video a week. Ten years, 600 videos, and half a billion views later here we are. Thank you all for helping us to achieve this milestone. Your motivational words, inspiring stories, and amazing progress pictures kept us going in the moments when we were up (and moments when we were down). Likewise, knowing our entertaining videos helped you to laugh, learn and stay consistent was the push for us to keep making them. We hope we can continue to keep making content for the next 10 years, and we hope you'll continue to enjoy it. Until then, we hope you like this career retrospective. Stay safe, stay hungry, and most importantly: STAY BUFF. -Hudson &amp; Brandon (The B.U.F.F. Dudes)<br /><br />And for those of you wondering why we look younger in the video, it's because we were! This was actually shot 7 years ago with the help of the amazing Greg Edwards (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GregtheGrouch)">https://twitter.com/GregtheGrouch)</a> and Adam Grimes (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/learnfromgrimes).">https://instagram.com/learnfromgrimes).</a> We finally released it, dudes. ðŸ’ªðŸ˜„{% endraw %}
