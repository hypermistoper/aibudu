{% raw %}Seychelles worth the hike? Come along with Vic and I to find out what you can expect if its in your plans to come to the Seychelles and go hiking. <br /><br /><br />We started off this adventure on a hike called &quot;Le Morne Blanc&quot; in the Seychelles, it was very interesting as we had never seen such vegetation before! Definitely worth hiking in the hot weather!<br /><br />We then headed to Bel Ombre in the North East of the Seychelles to hike a trail called &quot;Mare Aux Cochons'. We got interrupted by the rain and had to hide under palm trees for just under an hour, it was so much fun as we love being outdoors while hiking.<br /><br />And lastly to end the video we went on a hike called &quot;La Reserve Trail&quot;. Ill be honest with you I'm not exactly sure where this hike is located in the Seychelles. BUT WE SAW PINK PINEAPPLES WTF IT WAS CRAZY!!!! Thats why i love Hiking man you can find such cool things!<br /><br /><br />I hope you enjoy the video and have the occasion to form an idea if it would be in your best interest to pack your hiking shoes when coming to the SEYCHELLES.<br /><br />ENJOY!!!! <br />DON'T FORGET TO SUBSCRIBE!!!!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />FIND ME HERE:<br /><br />INSTAGRAM:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/willtevs/?hl=fr">https://www.instagram.com/willtevs/?hl=fr</a> <br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/WillTevsOfficial">https://www.facebook.com/WillTevsOfficial</a><br /><br />VIC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/victoria_duthil/">https://www.instagram.com/victoria_duthil/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Song: Nettson - Be Myself<br />Music provided by Vlog No Copyright Music.<br />Creative Commons - Attribution 3.0 Unported<br />Video Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/N3-hDTegP44">https://youtu.be/N3-hDTegP44</a><br /><br />Song: LÃ–VI - Pretty<br />Music provided by Vlog No Copyright Music.<br />Video Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/jEDLcx8Wft4">https://youtu.be/jEDLcx8Wft4</a><br /><br /><br />Song: SKANDR - Open Your Mind (Vlog No Copyright Music)<br />Music promoted by Vlog No Copyright Music.<br />Video Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Oskc6f2SX2g">https://youtu.be/Oskc6f2SX2g</a><br /><br />Song: Vendredi - All Night Long<br />Music provided by Vlog No Copyright Music.<br />Creative Commons - Attribution 3.0 Unported<br />Video Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/j5PyF0I7Gg8">https://youtu.be/j5PyF0I7Gg8</a><br /><br />Song: XIXI - Find You<br />Music provided by Vlog No Copyright Music.<br />Video Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/TOcs9wYz3bQ">https://youtu.be/TOcs9wYz3bQ</a><br /><br />Song: LAKEY INSPIRED - Electric (Vlog No Copyright Music)<br />Music provided by Vlog No Copyright Music.<br />Video Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/dcxUCpsOTGo">https://youtu.be/dcxUCpsOTGo</a><br /><br /><br />Song: Andrew Applepie - Almost Winter (Vlog No Copyright Music)<br />Music provided by Vlog No Copyright Music.<br />Video Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mapOvXdSLy0">https://youtu.be/mapOvXdSLy0</a>{% endraw %}
