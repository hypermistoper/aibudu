{% raw %}Welcome to the Here’s My Story channel. I’m Mateo. Lately, my dad was having a hard time paying our bills. I started working part-time at a grocery store to contribute to the family finances. One day, as I was on my way home from work, I got a phone call. The person at the other end of the line said, &quot;I'm so sorry to disturb you at this hour.  I'm an attorney, and I represent your paternal grandfather.&quot;{% endraw %}
