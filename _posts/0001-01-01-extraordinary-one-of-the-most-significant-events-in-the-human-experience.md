{% raw %}One of the most significant events in the human experience is loss. It comes in all sizes throughout our lifetime.  And yet, so many of us do our best to avoid our grief, shorten it, medicate it, or push through it with our eyes closed.  We have forgotten the value of grief. We have allowed the intensity of the experience to overshadow the benefit we can receive.  <br /><br />Even though you come out of loss hurt, you can grow and you can learn.  If we let grief shake us into being kinder human beings, we wake up to our shared humanity.  We wake up to what binds us together as people.  We see the light in each other.  We find community. <br /><br />And maybe, armed with all the gifts and lessons of loss, we’ll walk each step differently, more mindfully, intentionally, and deliberately.  And when we choose to walk this path with our eyes focused on the gifts, they multiply.<br /><br />Filmed in Cape Town, South Africa. <br />Featuring Mpoki Grace Gumede (Instagram : @mphokigrace)<br /><br />All of our films are made possible through the generous support of our patrons.<br />To be part of this journey : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/greenrenaissance">https://www.patreon.com/greenrenaissance</a> <br />If you'd prefer to make once off contribution, our PayPal details are : paypal.me/greenrenaissance<br /><br />Join our YouTube channel to get early access to our films :<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcPPUszZ4-7yzZNgAAYwJjg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcPPUszZ4-7yzZNgAAYwJjg/join</a><br /><br />Who is Green Renaissance?
