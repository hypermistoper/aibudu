{% raw %}Erine Gray founded Aunt Bertha - a search engine that makes it easy for people to find food, health, housing and education programs in the USA. Aunt Bertha's mission is to make human service program information more accessible<br />to both people and programs. Erine Gray is a 2014 TED Fellow and a 2012 Unreasonable Institute Fellow.<br /><br />www.auntbertha.com<br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
