{% raw %}Planet Earth is a very beautiful place. If you don't believe us on that...you really haven't watched Discovery Channel or Animal Planet, have you? Because they've literally shown how beautiful it is in their various award-winning documentaries...that they can't seem to stop making. We try not to judge. But even to the most scientific of people, the world does have a few places that just don't seem like it SHOULD work...and yet it does. True &quot;mysteries of life&quot; if you will. So, from the Ponnani Beach Sand Strip, to the boiling river in South America, allow us to show you 20 Real Places On Earth That Seem Scientifically Impossible!<br /><br />â–º For copyright matters please contact us: newfifth1@gmail.com{% endraw %}
