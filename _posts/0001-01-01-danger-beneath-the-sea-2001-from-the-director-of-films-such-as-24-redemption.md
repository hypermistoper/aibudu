{% raw %}From the director of films such as 24: Redemption &amp; Forsaken, comes an exciting thriller from 2001 starring TV icons Casper Van Dien &amp; Gerald McRaney! Following a nuclear weapons testing accident in North Korea, the crew of a US Navy submarine experiences a communications breakdown. Believing that a nuclear war has started, the senior officers prepare for retaliation, but one man is not so sure.<br /><br /><br />I claim no ownership over the film or audio itself.{% endraw %}
