{% raw %}I donâ€™t know what took me so long to get some lever actions on the channel, but here we finally are! In this video I showcase five lever actions from Henry. One in particular (Big Boy X) I suppressed with my Rugged Obsidian 45 and when running .38 Specials, it is quite. REAL quiet. Which was your favorite?{% endraw %}
