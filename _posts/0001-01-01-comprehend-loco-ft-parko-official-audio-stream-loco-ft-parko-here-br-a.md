Parko<br />Recorded at HQ Recording<br />Mix and Mastered by Adam Lewis Mixing<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />I don't mean height when I say that I'm not the guy to look up to<br />I've done things in my life that if I could<br />Change back time then I would do<br />But I guess we're all masking a vice<br />I'm not the one you should ask for advice<br />I was single again but I guess that is life<br />I've married the game now rap is my wife<br />Don't sketch but I draw attention<br />My words are a threat way more than weapons<br />You can bring all four of your bredrins<br />Cause my pen writes with the force of Tekken<br />No I don't know everything about politics<br />Sometimes I think it's a house with a lot of pricks<br />Opposite views who are spewing a crock of shit<br />All in pursuit of them making their pockets thick<br />They get people to fight in a war<br />Who got no idea what they're fighting it for<br />They tell you to die for their cause<br />They want more cash cause they're buying a Porsche<br />Don't mind me I'm just blazing a big spliff<br />So I see like you say that your wrist is<br />I dont want to risk it<br />That's what you say to escape all the mischief<br /><br />I don't really care if you hate me<br />You can give me air till you pay me<br />Everybody stares like we're crazy<br />Maybe we're loco<br />Till we sell out our own show<br /><br />Dont mind me I'm just being myself<br />Swigging my can while I'm reading the Metro<br />Sat on the bus cause I ran out of petrol<br />Wondering why I do it to myself<br />I need taught a lesson<br />Change is key like I'm a chord progression<br />But that's just me I don't take well to telling<br />I've got a streak in me guaranteed to melt your melon<br />Never said to tell them<br />That I reckon I'm the one to set examples<br />I mean I ain't ever been straight laced<br />I'm more Norman Bates with a pouch full of samples<br />Sipping on admirals spiced and Daniel's<br />Mixing drinks until my tongue feels tangled<br />Heads mangled looking like roadkill<br />Man I still step on stage and kill samples<br />Man I still<br />Spray like a G36C<br />Every bar dropped that's history kids be<br />Looking up to me when I flow bro<br />You don't want to be like me that's too risky<br />Me I cant chat no shit though<br />If the CDs whack it gets Frisbied<br />Dashed in a bush full of fresh dog  fecease<br />This opinion don't come with no receipts cause<br /><br />I don't really care if you hate me<br />You can give me air till you pay me<br />Everybody stares like we're crazy<br />Maybe we're loco<br />Till we sell out our own show<br /><br />I keep my business under wraps<br />Like a boxers fist on a punching bag Best believe that I come with facts<br />I've got food for thought and I'm munching that<br />You can frown but we'll pave the way<br />Until we're holding it down like a paperweight<br />And I ain't been payed for days<br />Cause I lost my job so I crave a wage<br />I've done bold stuff just for a pay cheque<br />I've even sold drugs and had to make beds<br />But it's just old cause money enslaves heads<br />If we revolt then we wont have to pay debts<br />When we say less<br />We do not try<br />My socks don't match I'm an odd guy I would to skip class<br />While I got high<br />Now I pay tax<br />And I shot vibes<br />Was a lost mind now I invest in this My words <br />Make your head spin like the exorcist<br />One day I'll be the best to spit<br />You can mark my words like your testing this<br />Smoking greens got me feeling blue<br />While I'm seeing red and I'm bleeding truth<br />Sometimes all you need to do<br />Is to be your best and to just be you<br /><br />I don't really care if you hate me<br />You can give me air till you pay me<br />Everybody stares like we're crazy<br />Maybe we're loco<br />Till we sell out our own show{% endraw %}
