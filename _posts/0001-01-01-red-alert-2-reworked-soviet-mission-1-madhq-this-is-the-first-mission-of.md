{% raw %}This is the first mission of the Soviet MadHQ's Campaign, Red Dawn. <br />The first mission is just as easy as the original but it has more stuff to do since the map is quite big and the enemy has many more troops and defenses. Quite interesting for to start off! <br />All missions are played on Hard difficulty. <br /><br />You can download MadHQ's reworked campaign here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://zombapro.ppmsite.com/index.php?page=Missions">http://zombapro.ppmsite.com/index.php?page=Missions</a><br /><br />0:00 - Cinematic<br />1:41 - Mission<br />3:31 - Soviet Engineer<br />4:27 - GI<br />4:53 - Conscript<br />7:40 - Attacking 1st Base<br />11:50 - Attacking 2nd Base<br />13:30 - Attacking 3rd Base<br />15:30 - Attacking Outer Defenses <br />19:00 - Attacking Pentagon's Base<br />23:45 - Attacking Outer Defenses <br />24:55 - Attacking Pentagon<br />25:42 - Outro<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Video Playlists:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/tsiripas/playlists">https://www.youtube.com/user/tsiripas/playlists</a><br /><br />• Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/mV2TqeZcSV">https://discord.com/invite/mV2TqeZcSV</a><br />• Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/youtubeTG/">https://www.facebook.com/youtubeTG/</a><br />• Donate: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/tgsacred">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/tgsacred</a><br />• Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/tgsacred">https://www.patreon.com/tgsacred</a>{% endraw %}
