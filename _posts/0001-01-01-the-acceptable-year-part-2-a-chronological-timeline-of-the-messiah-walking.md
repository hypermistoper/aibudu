{% raw %}A chronological timeline of the Messiah walking the Zadokite calendar. We feel that we have found enough scriptural evidence that proves at the very least that the Messiah did not follow the Jewish Sabbath and Feast days. In fact, He reproached them over and over for their practices. Also, a witness in the book of Acts shows us that disciples continued following the Priestly calendar after the Messiah’s death. <br /><br />Follow the Messiah as we journal His 1 year ministry.<br /><br />We are keepers of the mo’edim of our CREATOR- which are eternally fixed dates, dependent on the cyclic movements of the sun and observed in heaven and on earth.<br /><br />The Priestly Solar Calendar is recorded in Scripture and the Dead Sea scrolls- <br />For it is the unchangeable calendar of heavenly origin, based on the fixed eternal cyclic pattern  of the sun. Representing an immutable relationship between the Sabbaths and ordained festivals in heaven and on earth which are agriculturally based.<br />​ <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.remnantofthelight.net/biblecalendar">https://www.remnantofthelight.net/biblecalendar</a>{% endraw %}
