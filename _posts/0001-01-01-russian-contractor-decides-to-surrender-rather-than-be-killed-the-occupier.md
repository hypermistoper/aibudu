{% raw %}The occupier was afraid that he would be killed by his troops, so he ‘lagged behind’ when he had a chance.<br />‘It is my initiative to surrender so that my own soldiers don’t kill me. Mom, do you know what’s going on here? Our troops are killing civilians,’ the prisoner tells his mother.<br />He says the invaders do not want to exchange prisoners, and Russian propaganda is lying about the situation in Ukraine.<br />Commanders have been putting in soldiers’ heads that Ukraine has been taken over by national-socialists gangs that are killing their own citizens. So, Ukrainians must be ‘liberated’ immediately.<br />After the invasion, the Russian occupier ‘opened his eyes’ and saw a completely different picture. That’s why he decided to run away from commanders and voluntarily lay down his arms.<br />This is the right decision for any invader. Only in this way, they can save their lives!{% endraw %}
