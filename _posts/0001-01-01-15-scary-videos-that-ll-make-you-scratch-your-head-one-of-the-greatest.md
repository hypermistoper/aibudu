{% raw %}One of the greatest strengths of horror is its ability to pack loads of chills into brief clips and recordings. You will likely remember each scary video that you will come across on the eerie corners of the internet — and even years later, you are probably going to remember how genuinely frightened they made you feel. So on that note, it's time to settle in for a night of frights. Here, I bring you 15 scary videos that'll make you scratch your head. With their eeriness, it kinda seems that these creepy videos have got the recipe of scaring people stiff on point. As an adult, they still made me almost jump out of my skin when I watched them for the first time.<br /> <br />Truth be told, I feel absolutely thrilled uploading this list. Because it gives me a bit of relief that I won't be the only one shaking in my shoes after watching these scary videos. Everyone I showed these videos too, had their hair stand on end — and I am sure as you go through the entries in this list of top 15 scary videos, the same will happen to you as well. Honestly, these videos will put you through a horrifying ordeal — no joke, watching them at night could have them remain in your psyche for life... be careful.<br /> <br />Initially, I thought to name this upload &quot;15 scary videos you should never watch.&quot; But I realized what I would have done if I saw a title like that. Being a big horror fan who loves reading scary stories and watching creepy videos under his covers in the dark hours of the night, I'd have jumped straight into this list without a second thought. And it is my best guess that you would have too — and that moment would've shaped your nightmares for life.<br /> <br />We all have a few scary videos that still haunt us to this day. And in this list, you will find 15 such creepy videos. Filled with scary paranormal incidents, ghost encounters, and events that display mysterious happenings, the entries in this creepy countdown are legitimately terrifying. <br /> <br />There are plenty of arguments on both sides of whether or not having nightmares is fun. They can add a flavor of thrill to your life and can surely be fun, especially when you wake up and realize that what you just experienced was simply a dream. For a while, the sun outside your window may feel a little brighter, you may feel a little safer under the covers, and your pillow may seem more comfortable than ever. But what if the nightmare continues even after you get up? What if ominous thoughts keep haunting your mind, turning your life into a series of uncanny happenings? Doesn't sound too fun now, does it? That, my friends, is what the scary videos in this list will do to you.<br /> <br />So, I caution you. This list will leave you genuinely terrified. If you get scared easily, this is not the countdown for you. Be prepared to lock your doors, leave a light on, and still feel unsafe as you crawl under the covers with a flashlight. If you decide to dive into this list of scary videos, knowing that they may scare your socks off, it's totally on you. Again, do not watch this list if you think you can't handle it. <br /> <br />In case you did manage to make it through this list, congrats!
