{% raw %}The video where I did the testing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/09C0qEByoUk">https://youtu.be/09C0qEByoUk</a><br />It's a shortcoming of the English language that we don't have a dedicated and well defined word to describe people who can't seem to rank the various factors that make up a system by order of importance. People that get lost in the minutia, put way too much emphasis on relatively insignificant factors while ignoring the big picture. And discussing these insignificant details endlessly, to the point where others also start to think they are important.<br />Details can be important, but they must be important details. And you need to be able to recognize the difference between important and unimportant details.<br />Example: <br />Through my less than perfect (but still perfectly valid) testing on heat transfer between two metal plates, I have concluded that the type of thermal compound used is an insignificant detail. In fact (and I knew this before I ran the test) you can use anything that will fill the very small gap that may exist between the plates, as long as it stays there (it shouldn't melt out or evaporate).<br />Another example:<br />the ultimate strength of a specific type of glue isn't an important detail when it's stronger than needed for whatever you are putting together. <br /><br />Project plans for sale: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ibuildit.ca/plans/">https://ibuildit.ca/plans/</a><br /><br />Support this channel on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=865843&amp;ty=h">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=865843&amp;ty=h</a> <br /><br />My main channel: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/jpheisz">https://www.youtube.com/user/jpheisz</a> <br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ibuildit.ca/">https://ibuildit.ca/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/I-Build-It-258048014240900/">https://www.facebook.com/I-Build-It-258048014240900/</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/i_build_it.ca/">https://www.instagram.com/i_build_it.ca/</a>{% endraw %}
