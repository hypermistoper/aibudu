{% raw %}There’s been a few changes to my life that are impacting my channel. So here’s a preview of what you can expect in the next couple of videos. <br /><br />LINKS FOR VIDEO<br />Wat Huay Mongkol…<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/2u8vbu9y">https://tinyurl.com/2u8vbu9y</a><br /><br />If you are thinking of retiring or living in Thailand, please take a look at my book “The Retire in Thailand Handbook (The First Six Months)” its crammed full of information to help you tip-toe over the logistics of making Thailand your home as uncomplicated and straightforward as possible.<br />The Retire in Thailand Handbook…<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/366aw9jf">https://tinyurl.com/366aw9jf</a><br />Austin Macauley Publishers… <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.austinmacauley.com/author/hogg-gerald">https://www.austinmacauley.com/author/hogg-gerald</a><br />I am a retiree and though I love making these videos they obviously come at a cost to me as the cost of travel through the Land of Smiles when I make the videos takes a large chunk out of my pension. There are many “free” ways that would help me get recognised on YouTube, they include:<br />• If you like my videos on Thailand you can help me by pushing the subscribe button (which is at no cost to yourself). <br />• If you push “Like and Share” and leave a comment.  <br />• If you watch the video content of my videos all of the way through until the end.<br />All of the above will give me more exposure and more viewing time on YouTube which then helps my rating on the YouTube site. I would appreciate your help so that I can continue to improve my videoing equipment to enable me to make more exciting videos for your enjoyment.<br />My Thailand Blog… <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.retireinthailand.asia/">https://www.retireinthailand.asia/</a><br />My books on Thailand… <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/366aw9jf">https://tinyurl.com/366aw9jf</a><br />My Facebook… <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ged.hogg.3/">https://www.facebook.com/ged.hogg.3/</a><br />Twitter…<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/geraldhogg3witter">https://twitter.com/geraldhogg3witter</a><br />My website… <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sspchef.wixsite.com/mysite">https://sspchef.wixsite.com/mysite</a>{% endraw %}
