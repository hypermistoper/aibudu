Instead of training just once all in one go, I'm instead training 2, 3, or even 4 times a day. Of course, though, these are much shorter workouts that are nevertheless intense enough to trigger a response from my body.<br /><br />I started doing this for the practical benefits: training with shorter workouts should be easier to fit into a packed schedule. I was curious to see if this could provide similar results to regular training (i.e. training all in one go).<br /><br />What I found, though, was that this actually yielded *superior* results. I seemingly gained more muscle, burned more fat, and improved in strength and skill. Turns out there are some logical reasons for this.<br /><br />So, I probably won't be going back. This video shares those explanations, how I trained that way and how you can do something similar. What do you think? Will you be trying it?<br /><br />As always guys, thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
