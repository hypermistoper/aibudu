{% raw %}Compelled (Lyrics)<br /><br /> V1<br />We see righteousness and praise rising up<br />Throughout the earth, the Saints of God<br />A pure and spotless bride clothed in white<br />Full of faith, head lifted high<br /><br />PRE<br />(and) We declare<br /><br />CH<br />You are God<br />Glorious and mighty<br />Wellspring for the thirsty<br />The Answer for all<br />You are King<br />Jealous for the nations<br />Sending out an army<br />Compelled by Your love<br /><br />V2<br />We see every prison door flinging wide<br />As justice flows, You’re glorified<br />Salvation for the least and the lost<br />Your perfect blood, Your saving cross<br /><br />Br<br />You’ve compelled us with Your compassion<br />To proclaim joy and liberty<br />You’ve compelled us to take action<br />To see every captive freed<br /><br />You've compelled us with faithful mercy<br />To repair ruins and bring good news<br />You've compelled us for Your glory<br />To lead hungry hearts to You<br /><br />The earth is waiting for the unveiling<br />Of sons and daughters, the children of God<br />Release the fullness of Your Spirit<br />On every tribe and on every tongue<br /><br />Tag<br />May the Lamb of GOD receive the full reward<br />of His suffering<br /><br />#Compelled #GloriousAndMighty #PeopleAndSongs #AGWM #RizajenGomezChannel{% endraw %}
