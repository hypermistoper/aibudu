I embrace You as if You were already there and unite myself wholly to You. Never permit me to be separated from You.<br /><br />Amen.<br /><br />- Ascension does not intend for ads to disrupt the sanctity of the Mass and is urgently working with YouTube and the copyright holders of the praise and worship music to resolve the issue. In the meantime, you may see some of the music silenced for previous Masses to avoid any interruptions by ads.<br /><br />—  MORE FROM ASCENSION  —<br /><br />🔸Ascension’s main website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/ydypdqbd">https://tinyurl.com/ydypdqbd</a><br />🔸Ascension Media: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/ybctjtnb">https://tinyurl.com/ybctjtnb</a><br />🔸The Great Adventure Bible: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/yaw5tm9r">https://tinyurl.com/yaw5tm9r</a><br /><br />—  SOCIAL MEDIA  —<br /><br />🔸Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AscensionPress/">https://www.facebook.com/AscensionPress/</a><br />🔸Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/AscensionPress">http://twitter.com/AscensionPress</a><br />🔸LinkedIn:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ascension-press">https://www.linkedin.com/company/ascension-press</a><br />🔸Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/catholicfaithformation/">http://www.instagram.com/catholicfaithformation/</a><br />🔸Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ascensionpresents">https://www.youtube.com/c/ascensionpresents</a><br /><br />—  BULLDOG CATHOLIC  —<br /><br />🔸YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzB400_Skw95z2TmAsSkIg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzB400_Skw95z2TmAsSkIg</a><br />🔸iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/umd-newman-catholic-campus-ministry/id273537688">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/umd-newman-catholic-campus-ministry/id273537688</a>{% endraw %}
