{% raw %}This video seeks to understand the meaning behind the humour presented in Macdonald's jokes, and why it does or does not hold up today.<br />Macdonald's version of &quot;Weekend Update&quot; often included references to prison rape, crack whores, and the Germans' love of Baywatch star David Hasselhoff. He would occasionally deliver a piece of news, then take out his personal compact tape recorder and leave a &quot;note to self&quot; relevant to what he just discussed. He commonly used Frank Stallone as a non-sequitur punchline.<br /><br />Macdonald repeatedly ridiculed public figures such as Marion Barry, Bill Clinton, Michael Jackson, and O. J. Simpson. Throughout Simpson's murder trial, Macdonald constantly pilloried the former football star, often heavily implying Simpson was guilty of the brutal slaying of his ex-wife Nicole and her friend Ronald Goldman. In the broadcast following Simpson's acquittal, Macdonald opened &quot;Weekend Update&quot; by saying: &quot;Well, it is finally official: murder is legal in the state of California.&quot;{% endraw %}
