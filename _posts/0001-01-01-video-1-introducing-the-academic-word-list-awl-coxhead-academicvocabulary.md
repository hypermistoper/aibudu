{% raw %}#Coxhead #AcademicVocabulary #EAP<br /><br />ðŸ”µ Why this video was created:<br />Many students, teachers and PhDs do not really know what vocabulary is academic and appropriate to use in their work, so in their thesis, lecturers or research. This video helps them overcome this knowledge and skills gap by using the Academic Word List. Consequently, this video introduces this list to you.<br /><br />ðŸ”µPause the video when instructed and answer the questions in each section.<br /><br />**** A ****<br />How have you directed your learning efforts when attempting to learn or even acquire new vocabulary?<br /><br />**** B ****<br />What type of tools have you used so far to help you acquire the language? Write those down.<br /><br />**** C ****<br />Do you cram or do you space out your learning efforts to widen your vocabulary range in English? Write that down.<br /><br />**** D ****<br />Do you learn words from word lists? Or do you try to figure out how to use vocabulary you have looked up in dictionaries? Do you know in which context to use the new word and in which situation it would be appropriate or effective to do so?<br /><br />**** E ****<br />Familiar with false friends in English? Words that are dissimilar in meaning but look similar? These are always tricky to master, especially when you are learning them for the first time and together. Try identifying words that are similar in form and meaning and try to learn these at separate times.<br /><br />**** F ****<br />Do you use the [ctrl + find']/search option to look up words in your file in your text editor? Try it sometime and use the highlighters to double-check if you actually intended to use them in case the meaning is not exactly what you were going for. Use a thesaurus which is generally integrated into good dictionaries.
