{% raw %}Have you ever HIT A WALL?!?!  Have to Give Up A DREAM?!?  A Passion? A Business? A Life Vision? Well... I did this last year and I had to give up Stampin' Up!<br /><br />Here is a Video on what has happened... this was inspired after I hit a wall in exhaustion and it led to adrenals crashing, hormones going awry and life going upside down.  <br /><br />HERE is the FULL Post On My Blog with MORE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gettingcrafty.net/2022/01/why-i-left-stampin-up-and-whats-next.html">https://www.gettingcrafty.net/2022/01/why-i-left-stampin-up-and-whats-next.html</a><br /><br />I also LITERALLY Disappeared from the Stampin UP! system for two weeks!<br /><br />It also led to me giving up... <br /><br />Letting Stampin' Up! go after 16 years of doing what I love....<br /><br />I laid it down at the foot of God and stepped back.<br /><br />Guess what??  <br /><br />This is one of the reasons I love God - when you give up a dream, He gives you something much better in return.  <br /><br />This is also one of the reasons I love Stampin' Up! - with the support of my Getting Crafty Family (aka team) and my Getting Crafty Stampers, my family, my friends and even the support of those at Stampin Up!... I walked away... <br /><br />I paused...<br /><br /> and I had to say to the Lord &quot;OK, Father God, if you want me to let this go, to walk away after 16 years of doing this as a business.. I will.&quot;<br /><br />This week it hit me.. this has been YEARS (especially the last two) where I had to continually do that.. extract my fingers that clung so deeply to what I wanted... to lay it at the foot of the Cross, to give it up, to see what God will do instead.<br /><br />Know what??<br /><br />It has been AMAZING at how God can turn, what seems like a loss, into a bigger blessing.<br /><br />So Good-Bye to what I knew of my life and HELLO to what is new.{% endraw %}
