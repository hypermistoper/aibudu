{% raw %}Do Dr. Eric Berg's ideas on cholesterol, diet and health match the science? Dr. Eric Berg goes over his wife's cholesterol values. Here's a look at Dr. Eric Berg's views on cholesterol and heart disease.<br /><br />We got a ton requests from you to comment on dr. eric berg going over his wife’s blood work. <br />Total cholesterol=not the best marker, but it associates with cardiovascular disease, with heart disease.<br /><br />2018 American Heart Association Guidelines:<br />“optimal total cholesterol=about 150. populations with cholesterol in this range manifest low rates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&quot;<br /><br />scientific advisory on dietary cholesterol: ‘no significant association with cardiovascular disease risk’. this is the science advisory on dietary cholesterol<br /><br />dietary cholesterol= cholesterol in your food. Serum cholesterol=level in the blood, in our blood work.<br /><br />He’s talking about serum cholesterol, total cholesterol= total cholesterol in your blood. but the link is on dietary cholesterol<br /><br />total cholesterol associates with cardiovascular disease risk but there are better markers. LDL-cholesterol is better. nonHDL-cholesterol is even better. apoB is the best. Dietary cholesterol associates with cardiovascular disease in some studies, not others<br /><br />Lipids travel in lipoproteins. cardiovascular disease (CVD) is about lipoproteins, but most public discourse focuses on lipids, the cholesterol, good/bad cholesterol, but its high lipoproteins that raise risk<br /><br />lipoproteins=vehicle, cholesterol=passenger. apob=best metric. apoB measures vehicles. lipids, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol etc measure passengers<br /><br />sdLDL = harmful, large LDL = fine? high cholesterol ok as long as particles are large??<br /><br />if 2 populations have same cholesterol, those with smaller particles tend to have higher risk. but for the same cholesterol People with smaller lipoproteins have more of them<br /><br />Particle size could be the cause of risk or an innocent bystander<br /><br />at a given level of LDL cholesterol, individuals with small LDL particles have higher risk. but at same LDL-cholesterol, the ones with smaller particles also have more particles<br /><br />it is the number of LDL particles, not LDL size or the amount of cholesterol, that is the principal determinant of heart disease risk<br /><br />association of LDL size with risk loses significance when adjusted for particle number, Apo B<br /><br />apob measures particle number. particle size correlates with risk but after you remove apob, or particle number from the equation, particle size no longer predicts risk<br /><br />1) statins, lower risk yet reduce large LDL<br /><br />2) patients with familial hypercholesterolemia have mainly large LDLs, and are at high risk, indicating large LDLs are not benign<br /><br />All ApoB lipoproteins under 70 nm in diameter, including VLDL remnants and LDLs, flux across endothelial barrier<br /><br />all ApoB-containing lipoproteins, including VLDLs and their remnants as well as LDLs, have approximately the same effect on risk of cardiovascular disease per particle<br /> <br />the decrease in risk per VLDL decrease was the same as the decrease in risk per LDL decrease. Thus VLDL and LDL pose equal cardiovascular risk<br /><br />LDL subclass measurement does not add independent info to LDL concentration (number of particles, apoB) along with standard risk factors (diabetes, smoking, BP, family history)<br /><br />don’t know your apoB? LDL-c and HDL-c are rough estimates but they can be off. when in doubt get ur apoB<br /> <br />‘sdLDL is a marker of inflammation’. sdLDLs are markers diabetes, IR, obesity. they associate well with heart disease because they’re a marker for many issues<br /><br />Replacing refined carbs (table sugar, candy, white bread, cookies, pizza etc) with unrefined carbohydrate from whole grains or unsaturated fats associated with lower CV risk<br /><br />Connect with me:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/DrGilCarvalho/">https://www.facebook.com/DrGilCarvalho/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/NutritionMadeS3">https://twitter.com/NutritionMadeS3</a><br />Animations: Even Topland @toplandmedia<br /><br />References:<br />Dr. Berg's original video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipbkwzyO_8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ipbkwzyO_8</a><br />AHA Guidelines:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000625">https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIR.0000000000000625</a><br />other refs:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11883-004-0050-5">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11883-004-0050-5</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lipidjournal.com/article/S1933-2874(21)00248-8/fulltext">https://www.lipidjournal.com/article/S1933-2874(21)00248-8/fulltext</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2722770">https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2722770</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/88/10/4525/2845681">https://academic.oup.com/jcem/article/88/10/4525/2845681</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4593072/#SD1">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/pmc/articles/PMC4593072/#SD1</a><br /><br />Disclaimer: The contents of this video are for informational purposes only and are not intended to be medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment, nor to replace medical care.
