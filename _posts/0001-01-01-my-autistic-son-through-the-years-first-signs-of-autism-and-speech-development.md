{% raw %}This week I'd like to show you some videos of Dylan from 0 to 10 years old. You'll be able to see Dylan's first signs of Autism and also how his speech developed over the years. When Dylan was first diagnosed, I always wanted to see what an 8-year-old or a 10-year-old looked like, so I hope this video will help you in some way. <br /><br /><br />You can find more of Dylan's gaming videos on his channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3cQhpzCnV6Qh3pnItibY8A/featured">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3cQhpzCnV6Qh3pnItibY8A/featured</a><br /><br />If you're interested to find out more about Dylan's development check out this video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/UzVWsKUgTuE">https://youtu.be/UzVWsKUgTuE</a><br /><br />If you're here because of a recent diagnosis, make sure you check out my tips on what you should do after a diagnosis:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/8FVOQpIZV7U">https://youtu.be/8FVOQpIZV7U</a><br /><br /><br />If you're new to my channel, welcome to the family and thank you for watching our video. Here's a little bit about me, I am a wife, a mother of three beautiful children, and a former actress. Following my eldest son (Dylan)'s diagnosis of ASD, I threw myself into knowing all there was to know about Autism and how to help him. After 6 years of research, I wrote my first book 'Coming Home to Autism', with my friend and speech therapist, Rhian Grounds. My mission is to help support and inspire parents of special needs children!<br />________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Social media:<br /><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/taraleniston">http://instagram.com/taraleniston</a><br /><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/cominghometoautism">http://facebook.com/cominghometoautism</a><br /><br />Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://cominghometoautism.com/">http://cominghometoautism.com/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Business enquiries:<br /><br />info@cominghometoautism.com<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Video Producer: <br /><br />Tiara Westlake <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kamukami.com/">https://www.kamukami.com/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Music:<br /><br />Audio Library<br />__________________________________________________________________{% endraw %}
