{% raw %}On site with electrician Matt looking at a potential issues with the size of the cable feeding an electric shower. Matt using the rating information on the shower to see that it is 9.5 kW but the circuit is wiring in 6 mm2 twin and CPC cable. Matt asked the question is this cable large enough to carry this load current..? What other factors need to be considered other than the maximum current cable cable can carry..? What happens to cables that are installed in thermal insulation..?<br /> <br />== üïê Time Stamps - Cut to the action üïï ==<br /><br />00:00 - Shower circuit<br />00:31 - Checking the tightness of the connections<br />01:29 - Natural loop<br />02:20 - Setting the shower to maximum<br />02:58 - It's a 9.5 kW shower<br />03:13 - Cable size is 6 mm2<br />03:30 - Measuring the full load current<br />04:41 - Should the circuit be wired in 10.0 mm2 cable<br /><br />Videos are training aids for City and Guilds (C and G) and EAL courses Level 1, 2, 3 plus AM2, AM2S and AM2E.<br /><br />You can follow me day by day on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and TikTok lookout for &quot;GSH Electrical‚Äù.  <br /><br />‚ñ∂Ô∏è FACEBOOK <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/gshelectrical/">https://www.facebook.com/gshelectrical/</a><br /><br />‚ñ∂Ô∏è INSTAGRAM <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/p/BrIhZmrAYGDTmjMdb9lUNQodMevqsbDDki3qpQ0/">https://instagram.com/p/BrIhZmrAYGDTmjMdb9lUNQodMevqsbDDki3qpQ0/</a><br /><br />‚ñ∂Ô∏è TWITTER <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/gsh_electrical">https://mobile.twitter.com/gsh_electrical</a><br /><br />‚ñ∂Ô∏è TikTok <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRBLFdhe/">https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRBLFdhe/</a><br /><br />#GSHElectrical #Electricaltrainingvideos{% endraw %}
