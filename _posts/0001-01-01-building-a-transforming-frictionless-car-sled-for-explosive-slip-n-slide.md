Back in Scrap Mechanic today with the boiz and we are doing the explosive Slip N' Slide challenge! The idea is to build a vehicle that lifts up its wheels and slides on its undercarriage through a gate made of explosions that gets increasingly smaller with each round! Who will win and who will perish?! Make sure to check out the video and I hope you guys enjoy it as much as we enjoyed playing it! See you in the next one! <br /><br />Thanks for watching the video!

Choose from the 100+ building parts you have at your disposal and create anything from crazy transforming vehicles to a house that moves. Youâ€™re even able to team up with your friends to create amazing things together: in Scrap Mechanic, youâ€™re the master creator of anything you can imagine!<br /><br />Hereâ€™s the deal: youâ€™re a robot maintenance mechanic en route to your posting on a fully-automated agriculture planet. Your job is to take care of the worker robots as they work the land, sending the food they produce to the metropolitan planets. Thing is, close to touchdown your spacecraft loses control and crashes, but since youâ€™ve got luck on your side (ermâ€¦), you survive! Youâ€™re stranded though, and at first glance you find that not everythingâ€™s quite as it should be. The Farmbots working the fields have gone crazy, and now thereâ€™s only one way to stay alive: using your quick thinking, your creativity and your wily knack of turning your surroundings to your advantage.{% endraw %}
