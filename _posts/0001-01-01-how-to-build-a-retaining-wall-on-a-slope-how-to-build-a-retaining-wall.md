{% raw %}How to build a retaining wall on a slope - This customer's backyard has a pretty steep hill so we installed a retaining wall to give them a level portion. We built a 3' retaining wall with geogrid reinforcement. The wall we built has curved corners and steps built into the wall. We also built a paver patio with a fire pit. <br /><br />Paver patio time lapse - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9vFffqOt6mE">https://youtu.be/9vFffqOt6mE</a><br /><br />Buried Concrete Surprise - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/k1A_s5iPVOE">https://youtu.be/k1A_s5iPVOE</a> <br /><br />Music: www.bensound.com{% endraw %}
