{% raw %}We drive the 2022 Toyota GR86 and it is simply brilliant. With more power and torque a revised suspension and better steering, it's the most fun car I've ever driven under $30,000.<br /><br />The old 2.0-liter flat-four that was noisy in a bad way has been enlarged to displace 2.4 liters. Horsepower rises from 200 in the previous automatic version and 205 in the old manual to 228 across the board. 184 ft-lbs of torque is now available at 3,700 rpm instead 156 pound feet  at 6,500 rpm in the old car. <br /><br />It makes for a seriously entertaining car!<br /><br />0:00 Introduction<br />0:54 Exterior<br />03:44 Engine and Transmission <br />04:31 Interior<br />09:37 Driving <br />16:09 Verdict<br /><br />2022 Toyota GR86 Premium Numbers<br /><br />BASE PRICE:  $30,300<br />PRICE AS TESTED:  $33,250<br />VEHICLE LAYOUT: Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive, 4-passenger, 2 door coupe<br />ENGINE:  2.0 liter DOHC 16-valve flat-4<br />POWER: 228 hp @ 7,000 rpm<br />TORQUE: 184 lb-ft @ 3,700 rpm<br />TRANSMISSION:  6-speed automatic with paddle shifters<br />0-60 MPH:  6.6 seconds<br />CURB WEIGHT:  2,868 lb<br />CARGO VOLUME: 6.9 ft³<br />FUEL ECONOMY Combined/city/highway: 24/21/31 mpg <br />OUR OBSERVED: 20.7 mpg<br />PROS: More power and torque, terrific handling, great fun<br />CONS: Can be noisy on the highway{% endraw %}
