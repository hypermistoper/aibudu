It’s a reflection of a dynamic connection with someone and trying to hold onto whatever is left. The aim of not giving up on it, all the while knowing you’ve been willingly blind to the fact things are broken. It was written in sections, years apart. It started as a piano ballad, but since taken on a different feeling with added instrumentation and a changed structure. It’s been written and recorded in all different parts of the world. Originally written in Sydney, the clip was recorded in New Zealand, the vocals in Los Angeles and instruments tracks on the central coast of New South Wales. The song changed meaning the more I wrote on it and the more experiences I had while doing so. Morphing many life events, into one story to think about.”<br /><br />Produced by: Sure Studios<br />Directed by: Simon Morehead and Jack Toohey<br />Director of Photography: Louis Brandt<br />1st AC: Jack Single<br />Colourist: James Tarbotton<br /><br />#JOY #ThinkAboutIt{% endraw %}
