{% raw %}In today's video we look at the most walkable cities in the US -- but we're looking at the most walkable neighborhoods in the places that are commonly thought to be the LEAST pedestrian-friendly cities. These often end up being neighborhoods where you can potentially live car-free, but at a steep discount to what you might pay for a similar neighborhood in the usual cities that make top ten walkable cities lists.<br /><br />We'll  look at the Walk Score methodology that's the basis for this video's metric, and we'll talk about what it does well and what it leaves out. There are a lot of important aspects of the pedestrian experience -- short walking distances to destinations like grocery stores, restaurants, and public services are great. But the quality of the pedestrian environment, the difficulty of crossing busy streets, and a neighborhood's land uses and urban design play important parts as well.<br /><br />And - no freeways this time -- promise.<br /><br />Other CityNerd vides referenced in this video:<br />- Freeway-Heavy Downtowns of the US: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank"
