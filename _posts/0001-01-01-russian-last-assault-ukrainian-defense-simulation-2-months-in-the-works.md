{% raw %}2 months in the works, this is the epic final simulation in the most realistic strategy game. Russians prepare the last assault in the Donbas region, but on their way is an army with one of the bravest and strongest warriors. Their goal is to hold the line as long as possible and cause maximum destruction. Ukrainian all-out defense includes beloved American Javelin missiles, armored vehicles, Stugna-P Anti-Tank, RPGs, and tanks like T-64BV including the most advanced one T-84 BM Oplot-M. Russians have overwhelming amounts of T-72, T90, BMP-2, BMP-3, BTR, and infantry.<br />This cinematic was 1v1 turn-based gameplay, against the Top 3 CM players of all-time - RobZ. I was truly facing the hardest difficulty commander imaginable, so the game was played at the highest strategical and tactical levels.<br />That said if you enjoy then don't forget to leave a LIKE!
