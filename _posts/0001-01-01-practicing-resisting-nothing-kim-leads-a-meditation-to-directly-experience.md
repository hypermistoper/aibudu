This meditative movement practice was inspired by and draws from the ancient mystical teachings of qigong, t’ai chi, yoga, as well as the spiritual insights of Eckhart Tolle—yet it is not affiliated with any particular religion, culture, or form of yoga.<br /><br />As a facilitator of Presence through Movement, Kim travels and works extensively with her teaching partner Eckhart Tolle, the author of the best selling books The Power of Now and A New Earth. Kim has developed a teaching approach that incorporates and complements Eckhart’s teachings. Her work translates these teachings into a structured, embodied practice to support the arising of presence and the awakening of consciousness.<br /><br />Kim has offered retreats and workshops in North America, Europe, and Australia. She is the author of two instructional DVDs on Presence through Movement—Qi Flow Yoga and Yin Yoga—and of two audio-learning programs, Meditations for A New Earth and Resist Nothing, featuring practical ways to overcome our inner obstacles to presence.<br /><br />Kim was born in Vancouver, Canada. Her spiritual search began in the early 1980s. She met Eckhart in 1998, and soon after underwent a transformational spiritual experience while attending one of his retreats. This was followed by seven years of intense spiritual training, after which she began counseling and teaching.<br /><br />Kim sees our true nature—our essence—as living in and through our human bodies. Through movement and through our bodies, we can return to and awaken to pure presence and oneness—to who we are beyond the thinking mind and egoic sense of self—accessing infinite power and creativity.<br /><br />“When we are connected to Source, and body-mind-spirit are aligned—when we realize who we are at the core of our being—we blossom into our life purpose,” she says. “We cannot help but do so. And that is how we create what Eckhart Tolle calls ‘a new earth.&quot;{% endraw %}
