This is a very powerful card trick that happens in the spectators hands. You make an impossible prediction which turns out to be correct, even though the spectator had total control over the cards. This trick is also known as Jeopardy and has been used to fool famous celebrities such as Jimmy Fallon. The best part of all is that this is a very easy card trick, which seemingly has no explanation!<br />This trick uses any deck of cards and does require a quick setup.
