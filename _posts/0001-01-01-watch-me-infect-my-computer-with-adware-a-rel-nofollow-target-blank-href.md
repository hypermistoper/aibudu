{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.beneaththeblogger.com">http://www.beneaththeblogger.com</a> Just for kicks I decided to infect my computer with Adware. Watch and see what happens! I did this so I could show what the recipients of ppv traffic or ppv advertising actually see when they are viewing ads. If you know what your potential viewers are seeing then you will know better how to target your ads. Check it out and let me know what you think. Matthew Meyer.{% endraw %}
