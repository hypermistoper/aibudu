{% raw %}Philly has thousands of murals. How did it happen? In this episode of Vox Almanac, Phil Edwards finds out.

But founder Jane Golden took the idea far from its anti-graffiti roots.<br /><br />Today, Mural Arts Philadelphia is a large public art organization that innovates through public and private funds. These murals increase property values, draw in tourists, and help employ the artists creating them. In addition to that, the public art can be a tool for communities to express themselves.<br /><br />Famous Philadelphia murals have included works by Shepard Fairey, Keith Haring, Meg Saligman, and many others. That makes it a unique model of public art for cities around the world.<br /><br />Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
