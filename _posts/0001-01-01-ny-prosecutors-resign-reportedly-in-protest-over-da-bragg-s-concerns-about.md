{% raw %}On the justice front, it is often one two steps up, one step back. Today feels like a &quot;step back&quot; day, as the New York Times reported that the two lead prosecutors on the Trump Organization criminal investigation resigned, reportedly in protest over the new District Attorney Alvin Bragg's apparent reluctance to bring charges against Donald Trump himself. <br /><br />This video discusses this unexpected and unusual development, and what circumstances might be impacting DA Bragg's concerns and views about the investigation. <br /><br />For our Team Justice and Justice Matters merchandise shop, please visit: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.spreadshirt.com/glennkirschner/">https://shop.spreadshirt.com/glennkirschner/</a><br /><br />Please consider becoming a #TeamJustice patron at:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/glennkirschner">https://www.patreon.com/glennkirschner</a><br /><br />My podcast, &quot;Justice Matters with Glenn Kirschner&quot; can be downloaded where you get your podcasts.
