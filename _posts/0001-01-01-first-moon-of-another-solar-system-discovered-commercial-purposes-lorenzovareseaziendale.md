After all, in any survey, the first to be detected are usually the subjects out of the ordinary... the &quot;big sizes&quot;, simply because they are easier to detect with our current instrumentation.<br />Exomoons remain amongst the most elusive targets in observational astronomy. Nevertheless, these worlds stand to provide an unprecedented window into the formation and evolution of planetary systems. If the Solar System is any guide, we can expect exomoons will be geologically active and diverse, with the potential for hosting atmospheres, and even life.<br />Smaller, normal exomoons will have to wait until the Webb Telescope is fully operational.<br />But let's see how things went!<br /><br /><br />- -<br />&quot;If You happen to see any content that is yours, and we didn't give credit in the right manner please let us know at Lorenzovareseaziendale@gmail.com and we will correct it immediately&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Some of our visual content is under an Attribution-ShareAlike license.
