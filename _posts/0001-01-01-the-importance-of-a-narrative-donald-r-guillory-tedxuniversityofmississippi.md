{% raw %}The narrative is important in understanding who we are as individuals and as a greater community. Our narratives reveal who we are and allow others to better understand our histories, experiences, and humanity. Narratives are essential and vital to our human connection and collective history.  Donald R Guillory is Doctoral student at the University of Mississippi whose focus is on race, gender, and identity in the history of the U.S. and Latin America. A graduate of Georgia Southern University, he earned his Bachelor of Arts in International Studies and History, and Master of Arts in History. After serving in the U.S. Army, Don attended Arizona State University where he earned his master's degrees in education and liberal studies, focusing on the role that film and television play in shaping our perspectives about culture and gender.<br /><br />He is also the author of &quot;The Token Black Guide,&quot; which discusses and examines experiences and perspectives (historical and personal) on race in America. Don is the Co-host of TheNecronomi.com, a podcast discussing the social commentary in horror. His first two novels (Bastards of the Bayou, and Magnolia Lane) are slated for release in 2020. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
