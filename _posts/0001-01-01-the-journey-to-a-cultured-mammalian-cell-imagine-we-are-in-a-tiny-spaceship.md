{% raw %}Imagine we are in a tiny spaceship with a mission to explore the interior of a cultured mammalian cell. At the beginning of the movie, our spaceship approaches a laboratory Petri-dish. The ship dives into the liquid culture medium and cruises over numerous cell colonies during the process of descending. By following the clathrin dependent endocytosis, we enter a cell and start our exploration. Within the cell, we fly sequentially over to observe early endosomes, late endosomes, the centrosome, microtubules, the nuclear envelope, nuclear pores, mitochondria, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), COPII-coated vesicles, the Golgi apparatus, COPI-coated vesicles, lysosomes and peroxisome. Detailed structural features of these organelles are revealed or highlighted in the tour, such as the cisternal organization of the Golgi apparatus and the double-membrane nature of a mitochondrion etc. All these cellular structures are modeled based on electron or fluorescence microscopic data. The video ends by a bird view of the whole cell as we gradually fly away.{% endraw %}
