{% raw %}Bellator and UFC News. <br /><br /><br /><br />Bellator London adds Paul Daley vs Andrey Koreskhov.<br /><br /><br />Shavkat Rakhmanov wants to fight Michel Pereira next. A bit surprising he's calling out a guy who is unranked when he is<br />currently in the rankings at #15. It would make sense for him to call out the guys ranked above him. Would be more interesting <br /> to see how far he can progress up the rankings, as opposed to fighting a guy, getting a win, and the rewards is sitting in the <br />exact same spot in the rankings afterwards. Nonetheless, it would be an interesting matchup and fun fight. <br /><br /><br />Nick Maximov will fight Andre Petroski at UFC event on May 14th. <br /><br /><br />Joanna wants to return in the Spring and is aiming for a title shot. But she is coming off a loss so doesn't really make sense. She's not Holly Holm, <br />she's not going to get a title shot like that.{% endraw %}
