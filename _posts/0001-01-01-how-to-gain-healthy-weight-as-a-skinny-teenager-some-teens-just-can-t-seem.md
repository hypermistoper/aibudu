Factors like lack of nutrition, poor food choices, genetics, and fast metabolism may be the reason behind a teenager`s thin frame.  Stay tuned to learn more about how you can gain a healthy weight as a skinny teen.  Throughout your teen years, it`s normal to gain and lose weight due to certain reasons. <br /><br /> 10 Things Skinny Teenagers Can Do To Gain Healthy Weight  What you eat plays a big role in your body weight.  One of the golden rules to gaining weight is to eat high-calorie foods.  A teen can gain weight by boosting their calorie intake.  This way, your body has more calories than it burns. <br /><br /> Don`t be disappointed if you cannot increase the amount of food you eat overnight.  To ease your way up, increase your portion sizes little by little.  3.  Make sure to eat breakfast every day. <br /><br /> For some reasons only known to youngsters like you, skipping breakfast has become a thing for you all.  Also, fewer calories can lead to further weight loss, not to mention may affect your body`s metabolism.  Breakfast foods like eggs, oatmeal, peanut butter toast, and fruits are excellent choices for weight gain.  4. <br /><br /> Add starchy foods to your meal.  Starchy foods are great for boosting your energy and calorie intake, both of which are necessary for healthy weight gain.  Aside from eating more high-carb foods like whole-wheat pasta, quinoa, and rice, you can also have starchy veggies and fruits.  Well, good for you because they are beneficial for weight gain. <br /><br /> 5.  Eat more whole-fat milk or dairy products.  In addition, when preparing snacks at home like burgers and pizzas, use cheddar cheese and American mozzarella made from full-fat milk.  Fats are a great source of calories. <br /><br /> Other foods rich in healthy fats are salmon, trout, avocados, and walnuts.  Regardless of age, many of us like to snack between meals.  A perfect (and easy) way to maintain and gain weight is to increase your calorie intake by incorporating nutrient-rich snacks into your daily diet.  Eat mini-meals between your breakfast, lunch, and dinner. <br /><br /> Eating a bedtime snack, in particular, can increase your weight gain efforts.  Another way to gain weight is to build muscle.  Easy--eat more protein. <br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Subscribe to Body Hub!:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/nJ8d6r">https://goo.gl/nJ8d6r</a><br /><br />#GainWeight<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />‚ÑπÔ∏è Medical Disclaimer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pastebin.com/s0cHYHvf">https://pastebin.com/s0cHYHvf</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------{% endraw %}
