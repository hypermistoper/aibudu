{% raw %}**edit to add - I was under the impression that Trey was using an RFB.  He was not.  He was using an MDR, which is zeroed for m61 by default.  Regardless to that point, the difference between m80 and m61 isn't really noticeable at these ranges.  WITH THAT SAID, the points of impact that I pointed out were still accurate.  After speaking with Trey, we both agreed that if he had been using m62 in his original fight with Razzle, he likely would've won the fight on shot 1 due to the slightly slower projectile leading Razzle into the hit**<br /><br />A lot of times, we look at certain interactions and firefights and think that a game mechanic is broken.  But is it, really?<br /><br />I APPRECIATE YOU ALL!<br /><br />LIVE EVERY DAY ON TWITCH starting at 7:30-8AM EST - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/onepeg">https://www.twitch.tv/onepeg</a><br /><br />I hope you enjoy the vid!<br /><br />___________________________________________________________<br /> Links:<br /> ___________________________________________________________<br />GET A SHIRT WILL YA??  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ethosthreads.com/collections/onepeg">https://ethosthreads.com/collections/onepeg</a><br /><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/onepeg">https://discord.gg/onepeg</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/onepegmg">https://www.twitter.com/onepegmg</a><br /><br />Kraken keyboards: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.krakenkeyboards.com">https://www.krakenkeyboards.com</a> - use code ONEPEG for 10% off of the best keyboards on the market for the price<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.Advanced.gg">https://www.Advanced.gg</a> - use code ONEPEG{% endraw %}
