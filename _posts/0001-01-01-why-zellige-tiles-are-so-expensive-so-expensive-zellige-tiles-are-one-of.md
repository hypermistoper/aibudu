{% raw %}Zellige tiles are one of Morocco's most valued and recognizable art forms. But this type of tile isn't cheap, especially compared to other popular machine-made tiles. A square foot of Zellige tiles can cost $50. Compare that to ceramic subway tiles, which might only cost $0.15 per square foot.
