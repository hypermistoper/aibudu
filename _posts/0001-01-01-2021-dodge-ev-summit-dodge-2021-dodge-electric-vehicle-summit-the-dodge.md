{% raw %}2021 Dodge Electric Vehicle Summit — the Dodge Brand all but defines Pure American Muscle, and was born to push boundaries. Every ounce of technology that is integrated into the brand will be done to amplify the elements that define not just Dodge, but the muscle car itself. <br /><br />After more than a century of making trouble, we craft muscle cars with massive doses of attitude. Built for top performance — from power off the line to handling in the corners — every Dodge vehicle delivers an impressive combination of power, technology, capability and efficiency.
