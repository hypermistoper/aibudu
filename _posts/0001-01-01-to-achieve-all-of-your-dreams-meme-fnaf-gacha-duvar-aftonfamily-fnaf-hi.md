{% raw %}Hi !😀<br /><br />~~🎥About the video🎥~~<br /><br />🎶Music used in the video:🎶<br /><br />_ Shikabane No Michi (french version) by @AMVF Studio <br /><br /><br />🍭OC used in the video:🍭<br /><br />_ William Afton<br />_ Elizabeth Afton<br />_ ScrapBaby<br /><br /><br />🍡Fact about my FNAF AU:🍡<br /><br />_ Mrs.Afton's name is Clara<br />_ William and Mrs.Afton never abused their kids<br />_ Mrs.Afton's was killed by Ballora<br />_ Elizabeth can possess Ennard if she's near him and she wants to possess him<br />_ There's no Terrence or Vincent<br />_ Mary is Michael's adoptive daughter<br />_ Ennard is a mixture of the Funtimes<br />_ CC doesn't possess anyone and never did<br />_ Vanny is an American flag human<br />_ Vanny is Vanessa (this fact will probably change)<br />_ Vanny has a split personality (one wise, one rebellious)<br /><br />🌹Ship you'll may see :🌹<br /><br />_ None<br /><br />Ships aren't really shown and are mainly mentioned. The reason why is because FNAF isn't a love story and I prefer to draw attention on the characters than ships.<br />Also, not showing a lot ships can allow everyone to watch the video, even if they dislike the ships that are in my AU.<br /><br />🎞️ Summary of the video : 🎞️<br /><br /><br />~~🍣About this channel🍣~~<br /><br />Hi, I'm gacha_duvar (you can call me duvar) and I'm making gacha FNAF content (memes, challenges or mini movies). <br /><br />Videos are usually posted once a week or twice if there's a premiere or a meme. Community <br />post are usually posted everyday (with fun facts, sneak peek or others)<br /><br />The videos are in English (all accent mixted). I tried to put subtitles for other people who don't really understand English, but it takes a lot of time and it's kinda complicated 😭.<br /><br />I try to make the videos funny because why not? (I'm not trying to ridiculise or making fun of the lores)<br /><br />No, the AU isn't &quot;stereotypical&quot; or whatever 👀<br /><br />Gender : female but I don't care if you think I'm a man.<br />Pronouns: I don't really care<br />Languages : French, English, Spanish (a bit)<br />Age : 17yo<br />Favourite FNAF character : William Afton (mysterious, smart and his voice is so 🤩)<br />Least favourite FNAF character : maybe Foxy bro or CC (because we don't know much and/or anything about them)<br />Character(s) I simp for : William Afton, Aizawa<br /><br />~~🦋Aizawa the butterfly supremacy🦋~~<br /><br />~~💬Rules in the comments💬~~<br /><br />_ No discrimination (racism, sexism, homophobia ect...)<br />_ No link. If you want to show me a video, tell me the name and channel name and I will look for it by myself<br />_ No bullying and harassment. Repetitive hate will result to block and delete.<br />_ If you criticize my video, put at least an argument why. Otherwise, it will be count as hate.<br />_ Don't correct my AU. It's impossible to make an entire canon AU, so we have to do with what we have.<br /><br />❗Not respecting those rules can result to a block and/or comment delete❗<br /><br /><br />⚠️Don't repost or steal the video !<br />My AU isn't canon. If there's any mistakes, let's just say it's a part of my AU. ⚠️<br />Remember, you're not forced to watch the video.<br /><br />Thank you 😄<br /><br /><br />~~📱If you want to contact me or chat :📱~~<br />Tik Tok : gacha_duvar<br />                gacha_duvar2.0<br />Insta : gacha_duvar<br />Discord : gacha_duvar#4452<br /><br /><br />#gacha #gachalife #gachaclub #fnaf #aftonfamily #fivenightsatfreddys #viral #afton #aftons #5naf{% endraw %}
