{% raw %}An internationally acclaimed flautist of India, Pandit Hariprasad Chaurasia is an artiste par excellence who is known for his outstanding contribution in popularizing Indian Classical Music all over the world.  His consummate artistry has distinguished him as the greatest living master of the North Indian Bamboo Flute. <br /><br />This raag is also called as Kafi thaat raga. It was created by Swami Haridas. It is believed that he brought Lord Krishna to earth by singing this raga who took the form of an idol which can still be seen in Mathura.<br /><br />The notes Ga and dha are not used in this raga (but there are some schools of opinion that applies dha as well in a particular way) . Its origin from thaat Kaafi is peculiar as it uses the shuddha form of “ni” in its Aaroha, whereas the komala form of “ni” and “ga” is the main characteristic of the Kaafi thaat. So it forms its resemblance to the ragas based on thaat Khamaj.<br /><br />Enjoy and stay connected!<br /><br />Subscribe Music Today channel for unlimited entertainment<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx2uJwwk-VbxDeH-omCHDuQ?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx2uJwwk-VbxDeH-omCHDuQ?sub_confirmation=1</a>{% endraw %}
