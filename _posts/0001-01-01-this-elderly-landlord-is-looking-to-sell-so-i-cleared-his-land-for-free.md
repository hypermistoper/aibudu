{% raw %}This one was pretty fun and it took some time! It felt great being able to help a elderly home owner who is looking to sell his home immediately because of his health. He is having a hard time maintaining the home and is currently renting it to some great folks who are moving soon since the house is up for sale. The renter expressed how it would help the home owner since he will now be able to walk in and on his yard/land! This man has a beautiful yard it just needs a little help and I was able to put my touch on it and bring out its potential. There were more things that needed to be done,but originally we agreed upon only cutting the yard. I left my number with the renter and told him to give it to the homeowner in case he needed more work done on the fence line :) You all know I love fence lines but some people enjoy the privacy from weeds and vines. I had already cleared enough for light to shine through the fence and that was my highlight of the day. The sun began to set and the sun light was able to shine through the fence and illuminate the land. As you can tell by now I really enjoyed working on this yard and land. It was beautiful to look at after finishing! I hope you all enjoyed your Earth day and are ready for the premiere!!
