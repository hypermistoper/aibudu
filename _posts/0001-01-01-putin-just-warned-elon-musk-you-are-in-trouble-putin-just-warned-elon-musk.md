{% raw %}Putin JUST WARNED Elon Musk &quot;You Are In Trouble&quot;<br /><br />In almost every field of science, and technology, US and Russia have always been competitors. Occasionally, though, stuff gets a little crazy.Well, no donâ€™t have to worry because there are no hostilities between them.But the vibes are not calm. It is no secret that Elon Musk is famous for his technological abilities.Therefore, Russia is getting a little jealous of his success and is trying to make things less exciting, and Musk is threatening them in response.<br /><br />The Russian space chief watched in awe as billionaires Jeff Bezos andRichard Branson took off into space in vehicles they helped fund - and wished his country's billionaires would follow their lead. But in the first interview with Western media since assuming the role of director general of Ros cosmos, Dmitry Rogozin told CNN that &quot;our millionaires prefer to invest in yachts rather than spaceships. But maybe kids of current Russian millionaires will be much more wise creatures.&quot;There is no doubt that Rogozin is highly impressed with the boom in space tourism that is occurring in the United States, led by companies likeBranson's Virgin Galactic and Bezos' Blue Origin.<br /><br />In this video we talk about spacex news, elon musk news, tesla news, spacex starship, spacex, elon musk, Elon Musk SpaceX News, Elon Musk SpaceX, Elon Musk News, SpaceX News, Elon Musk Russia, SpaceX Russia, Elon Musk Russia Rocket, elon musk spacex, spacex elon musk, elon musk russia, elon musk visits russia, elon musk spacex factory in russia, russia vs spacex, russia copying spacex, russian space agency roscosmos, dmitry rogozin twitter, dmitry rogozin spacex, russia spacex<br /><br />#spacex #elonmusk #spacexnews{% endraw %}
