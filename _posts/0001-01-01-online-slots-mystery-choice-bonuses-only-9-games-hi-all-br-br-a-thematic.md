{% raw %}Hi All,<br /><br />A thematic bonus hunt today! I have only played games whereby the bonus offers a mystery choice option, with the intention to take the mystery on every single game today.<br /><br />I have run remarkably well in collating these bonuses, some of which I know all too well can be extremely difficult to obtain.  I also know well that I am letting myself in for a succession of potential duds here, but I guess there is no better time to try than when managing to get them so cheaply.  <br /><br />I still wonder whether it makes any difference or not which of the options you choose, perhaps it depends from one supplier to the next.  That said, I am still erring on the side of it genuinely making a difference, despite plenty of occasions where the evidence is sketchy at best.<br /><br />These are the 9 I will be taking the mysteries on:<br /><br />Christmas Carol MW<br />Great Rhino MW<br />5 Lions MW<br />Tiki Treasures MW<br />Legacy of the Gods<br />Buffalo Rising MW<br />Temple of Treasure MW<br />Temple of Medusa<br />5 Lions<br /><br />If one or two of them fire this could be a spectacular result.  If not, I might find break even is a bit of an ask, even from here.  I hope you enjoy this one.<br /><br />#onlineslots #slots #bonushunt{% endraw %}
