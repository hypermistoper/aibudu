{% raw %}This exclusive clip is from Episode 8 of CATHOLICISM, entitled A VAST COMPANY OF WITNESSES - THE COMMUNION OF SAINTS.<br /><br /><br /><br />The story of the Church is told in the examples of those men and women who dedicated their lives to knowing and serving Jesus Christ. The Catholic Faith is made visible in real human lives.<br /><br /><br /><br />Father Barron gives consideration to some of the Church's greatest heroes, and demonstrates how their extraordinary examples display both the passion and creative potential of the Catholic Church. Highlighting Katharine Drexel, Therese of Lisieux, Edith Stein, and Mother Teresa of Calcutta, Father Barron tells the story of the Church as a vast company of witness who are called by Christ to be a Communion of Saints.<br /><br /><br /><br />Please share this with others!<br /><br /><br /><br />My blog post: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fallibleblogma.com/index.php/fr-barron-on-t...-to-be-a-saint/">http://fallibleblogma.com/index.php/fr-barron-on-t...-to-be-a-saint/</a>{% endraw %}
