{% raw %}Renée Zellweger has been capturing hearts onscreen for decades. Since making her film debut back in 1992, the actor has played leading lady to a number of famous actors, from Tom Cruise to Jim Carrey. But who are the lucky men who've been able to capture her heart off screen?<br />Zellweger has done a pretty good job of keeping her private life private.
