{% raw %}Starting To Build A Natural Swimming Pond<br /><br />Hello everyone and welcome back to another episode here at Maple Monkey Media. Its been a hectic couple of weeks and the work never ends but we are back with another video from when I was doing some work to the cabin and the property. <br />In todays episode I get going with starting to re construct the pond that I had dug last summer into a natural swimming pond. So in doing so I need to drain the water out of the pond, dig it down in the centre another couple feet while extending the shallow sides to the right and left. After its dug out then I can add some log walls for more structural support and to keep the water from getting dirty while your moving around in there.<br /><br />There is going to be a buffer area around the deep end encompassing the whole pond that will be filled with plants to help recirculate the water and keep it cleaner as well. <br />It is a big project to under takes but once it is closer to completion then I may look into getting a solar pump as well to get the water moving and flowing for better aeration as well<br /><br />It will be nice to have in the dead of summer, you can just take a quick dip and cool off. The garden area and pond area are going to be fenced off for some added privacy in the little oasis I plan on creating over the course of time. <br />Rome wasn't built in a day so I have to keep that in mind and just keep plugging away with all the projects on the go and still to start.<br /><br />if you want to check out some more content, be sure to check out my second channel where I will be posting a greenhouse build video that I am putting together at home for out huge garden we will be having this year.<br /><br />Second Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AdventurousAdam">https://www.youtube.com/c/AdventurousAdam</a><br /><br />Thanks for stopping by and I hope you have a blessed day!{% endraw %}
