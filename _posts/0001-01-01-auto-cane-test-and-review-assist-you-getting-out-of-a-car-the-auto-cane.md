{% raw %}The Auto Cane is a device designed to help you get out of your car. The handle provides users with stability and balance when standing or sitting from the car. It is compatible with most vehicles. The grab bar fits parallel to your car when inserted into a U-shaped door striker or latch. No modifications are required for use. This can be used by the elderly, injured, or anyone needing mobility assistance. You can more easily maneuver in and out of cars without caregiver assistance, preventing back pain from lifting and skin tears from pulling .<br /><br />Purchase the Auto Cane - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3i9KfoJ">https://amzn.to/3i9KfoJ</a><br />The camera used in this video was a Canon G7X Mark II - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3cyPDgb">https://amzn.to/3cyPDgb</a><br />As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.<br /><br />Contact me: AverageMe@Protonmail.com<br />BECOME A PATREON SPONSOR! patreon.com/VideoMark - Help me continue making these videos by sponsoring me at Patreon.
