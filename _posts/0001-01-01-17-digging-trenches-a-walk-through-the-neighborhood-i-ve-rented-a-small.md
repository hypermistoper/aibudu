{% raw %}I've rented a small digger to dig 70 meters of trench for the water pipe and electricity lines. I'm making a quick stop in town, and have lunch my neighbour Johannes. Finally the rain has come, and I'm taking a walk through the neighbourhood, getting inspired by some of the other houses. <br /><br />0:00 Arriving with the digger<br />1:11 Measuring land borders with geometra (surveyor)<br />4:23 A present<br />5:42 The first green trees<br />7:02 Digging the trench<br />15:03 Update about the toilet<br />16:01 Inner cabin site<br />18:16 Breakfast<br />19:27 A ride to town<br />23:59 At Johannes' place<br />29:26 Filling the trenches<br />33:44 Rain<br />40:36 A Walk through the Neighbourhood<br /><br />Instagram: @_espiritu.libre_<br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/martijndoolaard">https://www.patreon.com/martijndoolaard</a><br />Buy Prints: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://society6.com/martijnd">https://society6.com/martijnd</a><br /><br />Music in this video: Slow Growth (Extended Edition) - Max LL{% endraw %}
