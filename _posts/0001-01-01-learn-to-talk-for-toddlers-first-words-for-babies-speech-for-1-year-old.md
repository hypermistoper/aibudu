{% raw %}Our Learn To Talk for Toddlers videos show First Words and functional speech for babies, toddlers, 1 year olds, 2 year olds, 3 year olds and older! We show a mouth close-up, which may be helpful to children with speech delays and apraxia. This video focuses on over 25 first words! <br /><br />In this toddler learning video we show many common first words and functional words that can help toddlers communicate what they need and want. <br /><br />Words focused on include: Mama, Dada, Hi, Me, More, Go, Help, Eat, Open, I, Want, No, Ya, Mama, Dada, Ball, On, One, Two, Three, Done, Banana, Teddy Bear, Baby, Bubble, Down, Tummy, Peek-A-Boo, Bye <br /><br />As well as speech practice sessions, we introduce simple songs that help children with gestures and language. Gestures and imitation are important skills for toddlers! We also demonstrate another important skill for toddlers, pretend and imaginative play. <br /><br />If you think your child has a speech delay, definitely talk to your pediatrician. You may qualify for free speech therapy through your state's early intervention program. You can also get evaluated by a speech therapist. <br /><br />Rachel is not a speech therapist, but on several videos she has worked with speech therapists to share helpful techniques for speech practice. <br /><br />On our YouTube page we also have more baby learning videos, toddler learning videos and preschool learning videos. In our educational videos for babies, toddlers and preschoolers, we work on speech and language, milestones, gestures, baby sign language, pretend play, flash cards, social emotional learning, dramatic play, art, music, math, science, circle time, finger plays, singing, dancing, exercises, sensory play and more!<br /><br />Rachel has worked with children with special needs including autism, down syndrome, speech delays, apraxia, cerebral palsy and global developmental delays. She believes all children are smart, important, gifted, valuable and our teachers. <br /><br />We put your baby first and not entertainment value. That is why there is no loud music during the presentation of words. <br /><br />#learntotalk #learntotalkfortoddlers #firstwords #apraxia #speechdelay  #firstwordsforbabies #firstwordsfortoddlers #educationalvideos #flashcards #babies #toddlers #1yearold #2yearold #3yearold #milestones #babiesfirstwords <br /><br />Rachel has taught preschool music to young kids, toddlers, and babies and has a master's in music education from NYU.
