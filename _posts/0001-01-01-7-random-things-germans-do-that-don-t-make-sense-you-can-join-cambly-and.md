After three years of being married and dreaming about if something like this great adventure would be possible, we decided to quit the rat race and take on the world. We sold everything we had, quit our jobs, and took off! After 9 months of aimless and nonstop travel, we now get to fulfill our dreams of #LivingAbroad as #expats as we move to #Germany!<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />2:02 - Thing #1<br />3:21 - Thing #2<br />5:18 - Goals<br />7:00 - Quick fire round!
