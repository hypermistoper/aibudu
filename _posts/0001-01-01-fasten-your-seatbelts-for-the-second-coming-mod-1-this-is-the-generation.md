{% raw %}This is the first installment of 9 videos in a series discussing the second coming. Within and out of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, there is so much conflicting information on the second coming of the Savior that it's hard to discern what's correct.  Some people strongly believe the sixth seal has not closed while others firmly believe that we're solidly in the seventh seal already.   Since scriptures point out that the second coming will come as a thief in the night and that not even the angels of Heaven know the exact day of his coming, many believe that it's not for mankind to know.  The scriptures also point out that the children of light will know through recognizing the signs just as the fig leaves on a tree tell us that summer is nigh.  The signs are all here to show us that it is this generation that will not all pass away before all the signs of the second coming are fulfilled, and when Christ will reign personally upon the earth.<br /><br />This series covers misunderstandings of the scriptures' meanings with regards to the fulfillment of prophecy.  It details how we know that we're the generation that will usher in the second coming, and whether or not the sixth seal has passed.  <br /><br />In subsequent videos, we'll cover the promised blessings of Israel, the mission of the two witnesses in Jerusalem, and what are the aspects of creating Zion.  Then, finally, we'll cover the things that need to take place between Christ's coming, to the Mount of Olives, and his final coming when He'll officially reign king of kings.{% endraw %}
