{% raw %}The Ballad of High Noon - Do not forsake me, oh, my darling  <br />Tex Ritter (original soundtrack High Noon; Dimitri Tiomkin, composer)<br />It was introduced in the movie High Noon, sung over the opening credits by Tex Ritter. It was awarded the 1952 Academy Award for Best Original Song, and was performed that night for the Academy by Ritter. The song is about the film's main character, Will Kane (played by Gary Cooper), and the moral dilemma of his new wife, Amy Fowler-Kane (played by Grace Kelly), abandoning (or &quot;forsaking&quot;) him because he chooses to stay and fight (and risk being killed) instead of running away with her after their wedding. The song refers to how he can't have a safe life with her until he has eliminated the threats that face him, and he wants her to stay with him just a while longer until it's all over and not give up on him for good.<br /><br />In the context of film music, &quot;The Ballad of High Noon&quot; is acclaimed not merely for its musical integration with High Noon's score, but also for expounding lyrically on the themes of honor and obligation which define the film.  It is placed at #25 on &quot;AFI's 100 Years... 100 Songs&quot;. Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.<br /><br />Dimitri Zinovievich Tiomkin (May 10, 1894 â€“ November 11, 1979) was a Russian-American film score composer and conductor. Musically trained in Russia, he is best known for his western scores, including Duel in the Sun, Red River, High Noon, The Big Sky, Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, and Last Train from Gun Hill. Tiomkin received twenty-two Academy Award nominations and won four Oscars, three for Best Original Score for High Noon, The High and the Mighty and The Old Man and the Sea, and one for Best Original Song for &quot;The Ballad of High Noon&quot; from the former film.{% endraw %}
