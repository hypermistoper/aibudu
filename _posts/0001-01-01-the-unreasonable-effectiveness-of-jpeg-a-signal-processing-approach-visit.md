The majority of the focus is on the mathematical and signal processing insights that lead to advancements in image compression and the big themes in compression as a whole that we can take away from it. <br /><br />Animations created jointly by Nipun Ramakrishnan and Jesús Rascón.<br /><br />References/Additional Resources:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.red.com/red-101/video-chroma-subsampling">https://www.red.com/red-101/video-chroma-subsampling</a> - great resource on different types of chroma subsampling<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://weitz.de/dct/">http://weitz.de/dct/</a> - play around with the DCT<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~pkalra/col783-2017/DCT-History.pdf">https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~pkalra/col783-2017/DCT-History.pdf</a> - paper referenced in video<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/courses/DSPDF/00300_Transforms.pdf">http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/courses/DSPDF/00300_Transforms.pdf</a> - a more rigorous signal processing approach to the DCT<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.impulseadventure.com/photo/jpeg-huffman-coding.html">https://www.impulseadventure.com/photo/jpeg-huffman-coding.html</a> - great landing point for learning more about how huffman codes work in the context of JPEG<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4FSkFUgs&amp;list=PLpsTn9TA_Q8VMDyOPrDKmSJYt1DLgDZU4&amp;ab_channel=DanielHarding">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPT4FSkFUgs&amp;list=PLpsTn9TA_Q8VMDyOPrDKmSJYt1DLgDZU4&amp;ab_channel=DanielHarding</a> - a great playlist I recommend that dives deep into actually implementing a JPEG decoder<br /><br />This video wouldn't be possible without the open source library manim created by 3blue1brown and maintained by Manim Community.<br />The Manim Community Developers.
