This is a sentiment I agree with, and it’s an idea I wanna explore for myself. Why do we become resentful, what happens when we become resentful, and how do we prevent ourselves from becoming resentful?<br /><br />So rejected entitlement leads to frustration, and accumulated frustration leads to resentment. And so the belief behind resentment, if I’m going to put it simply, is this: “you shouldn’t be in my way”. Resentment builds when I believe you’re preventing me from receiving what I’m entitled to. The resentful eye is always looking for someone to blame.<br /><br />So how do we prevent ourselves from becoming resentful? In order to defuse all resentment in the mind, this idea has to be true: there’s a place in this world, and a way to that place, for everyone which can’t be denied by anyone except for themselves. In other words, it’s not possible for anyone to truly get in your way. That’s the idea that would have to be true for resentment to never build up in the mind.<br /><br />OUR COURSES<br />_<br />Coming soon.
