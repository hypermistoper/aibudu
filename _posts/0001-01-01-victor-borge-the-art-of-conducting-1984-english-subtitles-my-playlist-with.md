His blend of music and comedy earned him the nicknames &quot;The Clown Prince of Denmark&quot;, &quot;The Unmelancholy Dane&quot; and &quot;The Great Dane&quot;.<br /><br />==============================================<br />I have uploaded this video with English subtitles, as a gesture to all non-Danish speaking fans of Mr. Borge. I think they add a lot of value for many viewers. Enjoy !<br />==============================================<br /><br />From a desktop computer, click the CC icon in the lower right corner of the video to turn subtitles on or off. Click the Settings icon to switch to another language (if available) or to turn on auto-translate to your preferred language. On an Ipad, the CC icon is located in the upper right corner.<br />    <br />If you would like to translate the subtitles into your own language, then drop me a mail (check the About tab of my channel), and I will send you the English subtitles as a text file. You will then get my timing &quot;for free&quot; (please note that only the Danish speech part has been subtitled). You can now create your own file with subtitles, which you can mail back to me. You are also much welcome to translate the video title and description as well.
