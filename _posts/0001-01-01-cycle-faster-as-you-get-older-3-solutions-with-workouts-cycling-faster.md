Yep, before the internet! My journey has involved some wonderful adventures as both a performer and a coach. As a sports scientist I have never stood still and always pushed boundaries and limits. The rewards of this have seen me work with multiple national champions and internationalists. My intense curiosity though for fitness and performance gains has made huge impacts on the lifeâ€™s of what folks may call - the everyday athlete. I aim to use YouTube to share my knowledge of how to both improve your physical fitness and your mindset. How you train harder or even train less to make more progress! I will share with you how you can improve your mindset and apply simple daily routines to check your progress. I want to also use the channel to have fun! So, although I can be a geek for science at times, my ENFP personality does mean you need to expect the unexpected at times. ðŸ˜‚<br /><br />#cycling #training #ageing{% endraw %}
