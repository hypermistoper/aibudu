{% raw %}Our feed is always around 20 seconds out after we hit the â€˜go liveâ€™ button (quite a bit more complexed than that). But as we started the feed, this A321neo from Aberdeen was on approach so we went for it. But the feed went â€˜liveâ€™ to the viewers as the jet was climbing-out. So here it is! A full-on Touch and go, with a tail strike - checkout the paint dust after contact! You can also see the empennage shaking as it drags.<br />I thought the pilot had it, but the wind was swirling over the Office buildings on the Bath Road. And thereâ€™s a gap between the open reach building and the next set of office buildings, which allows the gusts to flow unrestricted across the runway. <br />In my view, the pilot deserves a medal! @British Airways training could use this in a scenario - happy to supply the footage FOC chaps ðŸ˜‰ but seriously, well done that Pilot.<br />I have to say, I had no chance to watch it back during the live, but Gilly had a quick look and called Tail Strike. I knew it was close, but due to the small monitor and being â€˜in the momentâ€™ I missed the tail drag. So good spot GP. <br />This has to go down as one of our best moments, just a shame we were 20 seconds late. Still, hereâ€™s how itâ€™s played-out<br />#avgeek #aviation #planespotting #tailstrike #jetblast <br /><br />To enjoy exclusive Member Only chat and content, checkout my 3-Tier Channel Membership and join us on International trips as well as Airside and Feature Shows.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkQef3Fidr7tm3gNuXgGKPw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCkQef3Fidr7tm3gNuXgGKPw/join</a><br /><br /><br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br /><br />You can read all about Big Jet TV and how we put your money to work at www.bigjet.tv{% endraw %}
