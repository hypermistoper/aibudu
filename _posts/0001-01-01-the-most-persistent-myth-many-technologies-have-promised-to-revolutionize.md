{% raw %}Many technologies have promised to revolutionize education, but so far none has. With that in mind, what could revolutionize education?<br />These ideas have been percolating since I wrote my PhD in physics education: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ve42.co/phd">https://ve42.co/phd</a><br />I have also discussed this topic with CGP Grey, whose view of the future of education differs significantly from mine: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vsCAM17O-M">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7vsCAM17O-M</a><br /><br />I think it is instructive that each new technology has appeared to be so transformative. You can imagine, for example, that motion pictures must have seemed like a revolutionary learning technology. After all they did revolutionize entertainment, yet failed to make significant inroads into the classroom. TV and video seem like a cheaper, scaled back film, but they too failed to live up to expectations. Now there is a glut of information and video on the internet so should we expect it to revolutionize education?<br /><br />My view is that it won't, for two reasons: 1. Technology is not inherently superior, animations over static graphics, videoed presentations over live lectures etc. and 2. Learning is inherently a social activity, motivated and encouraged by interactions with others.<br /><br />Filmed and edited by Pierce Cook<br /><br />Supported by Screen Australia's Skip Ahead program.<br /><br />Music By Kevin MacLeod, www.incompetech.com &quot;The Builder&quot; and by Amarante Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.amarantemusic.com">http://www.amarantemusic.com</a>{% endraw %}
