However the listener is afraid and they run away from the doctors and nurses and hide in a room in the old part of the hospital. In this room they are found by me, a hypnotist and doctor who gently guides them into a trance and eventually sleep so they can undergo the procedure. The listener in this recording is referred to simply as &quot;little one&quot;. This recording contains the following hypnotic stimuli: a gently crackling fireplace, a golden pocket watch, gentle shushing, a lavender scented blanket, being held on a rocking chair, the sound of a heart beating, and anesthetic gas. There is no wake up command at the end of this recording.<br /><br />If you are interested in commissioning a custom recording please feel free to email me a detailed description of the project you want at ultrahypnosis@gmail.com and I will get back to you with a price quote. <br /><br />If you are under 18 you should never video yourself watching a hypnosis video or respond to people requesting that you do so.
