{% raw %}In this video I'll be making an aluminum bronze knife to use around my shop. I made this knife from copper wire and pure aluminum. 90% copper mixed with 10% aluminum makes a very hard alloy called aluminum bronze. I made the knife by creating a sand casting and then cutting the shape of the knife out of it. I then cast pure copper pins and used them to attach walnut handle scales. <br /><br />--------  Affiliate links to items used in this video -------<br /><br />Polishing Compound <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3wHXof1">https://amzn.to/3wHXof1</a><br />The best polishing wheels ever <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2VjG2GK">https://amzn.to/2VjG2GK</a><br />Overture 3d printer filament <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2UqwwRC">https://amzn.to/2UqwwRC</a><br />Some of my favorite hand files <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3lFzUDO">https://amzn.to/3lFzUDO</a><br />The die grinder I use <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Aebg1c">https://amzn.to/3Aebg1c</a><br />Clear Coat - I love this stuff! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2V71kYj">https://amzn.to/2V71kYj</a><br />NeverDull metal polish <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3zumeiH">https://amzn.to/3zumeiH</a><br />Liver of Sulfur <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3rIUBjz">https://amzn.to/3rIUBjz</a><br /><br />Thinking about getting into 3d printing and/or metal casting?
