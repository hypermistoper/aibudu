{% raw %}Hi guys! In this video I get personal about My Weight Loss Journey and How I Lost 30kg as a teen. These are the tips that helped me along the way and hopefully, some of you will find them useful too! Thank you so much for watching! <br /><br />*Trigger Warning<br />If you have/are struggling with an eating disorder or find topics like calorie counting to be a sensitive subject please do not watch the video! Your recovery and mental health is way more important!<br /><br />Also, I want to make it clear that the figure on the scale is not the important part! This is different for everyone and by no means am I suggesting anyone with a similar figure should lose weight! This is purely based off of my previous and current lifestyle. <br /><br /><br />- New Content Each Week-<br />-Next Week: What I Eat In A Week!<br /><br />OTHER SOCIALS:<br /><br />I N S T A G R A M: @ecemgdn<br />T W I T T E R: @ecemgdn_<br />B U S I N E S S : ecem@mcsaatchisocial.com<br /><br />ðŸ’•Sub count: 0{% endraw %}
