{% raw %}I don’t want to be far from Imam Ali (as) in Heaven.<br /><br /><br />Follow us:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Panahianen/">https://www.facebook.com/Panahianen/</a> ...<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/PanahianEN/...">https://www.instagram.com/PanahianEN/...</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/PanahianEN">https://twitter.com/PanahianEN</a>      <br />Telegram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://telegram.me/Panahianen/">https://telegram.me/Panahianen/</a>      <br />==============================<br />We should tell everyone, “See your good points, so that you may gain energy to move forward.” When they say not to see your good points since you will become arrogant, this means if you see some goodness in yourself and stop. This is bad. But if you see your good points and gain energy to move forward, this is a beneficial self-awareness. Actually the peak of self-awareness is not seeing our bad points; it’s seeing our good points. Be so drowned in seeing your good points that you feel you can’t live without reaching the peak. You should honor yourself very much.<br />Imam Ali (as) said, «مَن کَرُمَت نفسُهُ هانَت علیهِ الشَّهَوات» “If someone honors himself, carnal desires will become contemptible to him.” [He’ll say,] “What’s this?! This isn’t right for my status.” The peak of self-awareness is for a person to understand his value. What is one of the good points we have right now? We should truly honor ourselves for this. One truly becomes excited when he sees this goodness. It is that we are not jealous of the Friends of God. We feel an affection for them. We are not arrogant toward them; we are humble and sympathetic toward them. This is very important! <br />My friends, if we look carefully at ourselves to see what it is we want, we’ll weep day and night because we are far from the Imam of the Time (aj). We’ll weep day and night begging God, “Don’t let my house be far from the house of the Commander of the Faithful (as) in Heaven.” This is what we want. This is a part of us. We don’t say, “Unfortunately, this tendency is not very strong in me.” This exists within you! How can I tell you this? You already have this! <br />The Arafah Supplication talks more about thanking God for His blessings than asking for forgiveness for our bad points. This is surprising! Imam Husayn (as) is drowned in this. If one gets close to Imam Husayn (as), the Imam will start showing that person his goodness. You participate in Imam Husayn’s (as) mourning ceremony wearing a black shirt. Then he starts. He’ll say, “See how good you are. You love me. You cry for me. See how good you are!” He increases your energy and uplifts your spirits. We should tell everyone, “See your good points, so that you may gain energy to move forward.”<br />Actually the peak of self-awareness is not seeing our bad points; it’s seeing our good points.{% endraw %}
