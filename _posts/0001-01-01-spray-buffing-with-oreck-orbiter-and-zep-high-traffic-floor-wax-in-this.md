{% raw %}In this video we show how to spray buff a waxed floor (4 coats in this case). For those who don't have access to a high speed floor burnisher, you can easily give floors a quick shine with this spray buffing method. We show the Oreck Orbiter being used for this, but you can use a standard 175 rpm buffer if that's what you have.<br />This method is used to add a little wax to an existing waxed floor which has been worn or damaged, and helps to fill in small scratches and scuffs to bring back a new floor shine. Using a mixture of wax and water (50/50 in this video), we show how you can make floor look like it was newly waxed. Burnishers actually remove a small layer of the wax, and this method adds a little, so the floors will last much longer using this method.{% endraw %}
