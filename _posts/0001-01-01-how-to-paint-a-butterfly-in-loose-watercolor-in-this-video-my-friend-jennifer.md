{% raw %}In this video, my friend Jennifer Rose shows us how she painted this Tortoiseshell butterfly in her loose watercolour style. She uses a combination of wet-in-wet and wet-on-dry techniques to recreate the butterflyâ€™s pretty markings and fragile wings. I hope you enjoy this class. Please leave a comment if you do!{% endraw %}
