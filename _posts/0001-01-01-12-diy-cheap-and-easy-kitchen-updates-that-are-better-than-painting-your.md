{% raw %}In this video I complete 12 quick, easy, and budget friendly updates to a sparse, boring kitchen. These projects include changing out the cabinet knobs, installing Dollar Tree peel and stick tiles, installing peel and stick backsplash wallpaper, changing out the light fixtures, building a kitchen table (for under $50), updating some thrifted bentwood chairs, applying window film that looks like bamboo shades, updating a dishwasher with peel and stick tiles, installing a magnetic catch to fix a cabinet door, hanging a plant in the kitchen window, creating wall art with thrifted finds, painting an accent wall, and converting a thrifted table into a small kitchen work island.<br /><br />My channel home page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/canterburycottage">https://youtube.com/c/canterburycottage</a><br />Also, check out Canterbury Cottage on Pinterest and Instagram.<br />Facebook Group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2916118271958839/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2916118271958839/</a><br /><br />My Amazon storefront: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amazon.com/shop/canterburycottage">https://amazon.com/shop/canterburycottage</a><br /><br />Music used in this video:<br />Summertime Rain by Little North Fork<br />Blue Mountains by Gabriel Witcher<br />Snowy Peaks pt. 1 by Chris Haugen<br /><br />Vintage butterfly images:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ibb.co/4TkXYtx">https://ibb.co/4TkXYtx</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ibb.co/G7jyJyJ">https://ibb.co/G7jyJyJ</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ibb.co/pRYdDgV">https://ibb.co/pRYdDgV</a>{% endraw %}
