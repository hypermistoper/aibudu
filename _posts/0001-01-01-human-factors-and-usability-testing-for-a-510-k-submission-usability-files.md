{% raw %}Usability files for CE Marking of Medical Devices are often rejected by the FDA, because the usability testing satisfies IEC 62366-1, but it does not meet the requirements of the FDA's guidance on Human Factors. This video briefly explains why. Rob Packard will speak more on this at the 510(k) Workshop in Amsterdam. The workshop begins on October 10, 2018 @ 9:00am. The workshop is two days and the cost is $600 total.
