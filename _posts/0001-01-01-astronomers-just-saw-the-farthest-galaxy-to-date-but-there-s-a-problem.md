{% raw %}Astronomers have spotted the most distant galaxy found to date, named HD1. The highly redshifted galaxy lies 13.5 billion light years from Earth. The present proper distance to HD1, which also considers the expansion of the universe, is 33.4 billion light years. The far-flung galaxy was discovered using four powerful optical and infrared telescopes after 1200 hours of observing time and searching through 700,000 objects. <br /><br />But there's something typical about the HD1 galaxy that is not making sense to astronomers. This fourth episode of the Sunday Discoveries Series explains this breakthrough in detail.<br /><br />RESEARCH PAPERS:<br /><br />Research Paper 1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00823.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.00823.pdf</a><br />Research Paper 2: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09141.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09141.pdf</a><br /><br />REFERENCES:<br /><br />Starburst Galaxies: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3EkDCKD">https://bit.ly/3EkDCKD</a><br />Star Formation Rate: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3vsjNNe">https://bit.ly/3vsjNNe</a><br />Lyman-break Galaxies: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3uOSn59">https://bit.ly/3uOSn59</a><br /><br />Created By: Rishabh Nakra<br />Narrated By: Jeffrey Smith<br />Produced By: Rishabh Nakra<br /><br />All episodes of the series: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/369kG4p">https://bit.ly/369kG4p</a><br />Basics of Astrophysics series: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3xII54M">https://bit.ly/3xII54M</a><br /><br />The Secrets of the Universe on the internet:<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/sou_website">https://bit.ly/sou_website</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/sou_fb">https://bit.ly/sou_fb</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/sou_ig">https://bit.ly/sou_ig</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/sou_twitter">https://bit.ly/sou_twitter</a>{% endraw %}
