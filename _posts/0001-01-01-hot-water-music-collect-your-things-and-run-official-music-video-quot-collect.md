Don’t look back on the rising tide again. Cause what is gone is gone. In the end. We only got what we had when we began. I count to 4, 5, 6, I feel like shit. I know. It’s a long way back down an ever empty road. I get to 8, 9, 10. I don’t care when. I know. Don’t lose track of yourself. Say not me. Hell no. Say not me. Hell no. You’re not the only one in your head. Don’t lose track now. The right ones must be fed. I tell ya now. Don’t wait. Don’t hesitate. I know. Don’t lose track of yourself. Say not me. Hell no. Not me. Hell no.<br /><br />Credits:<br />Director: Jesse Korman<br />Editing, Animation: Lazers Lab<br /><br />Gainesville:<br />Filmed by George Rebelo and Neltie Black<br />Special thanks to Ben Andrews, Chuck from Hell, Dave &quot;SPINACH&quot; Malinsky, Billy Rohan &amp; Samurai Skate Shop<br /><br />Toronto:<br />Filmed by Katie Cresswell <br /><br />Grass Valley:<br />Filmed by Jill Ragan, Emile Janicot, Jake DesRochers, and Gus Coronel<br /><br />Santa Cruz footage filmed by:<br /><br />Joe Perrin, Nick Hanson, Trevar Cushing, Justin Albert, Tanner Rowe, Ira Ingram and Brendan Bill{% endraw %}
