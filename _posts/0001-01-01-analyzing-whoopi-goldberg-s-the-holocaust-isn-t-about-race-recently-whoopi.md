{% raw %}Recently, Whoopi Goldberg made the highly controversial statement &quot;the Holocaust isn't about race.&quot; Let's dive into the historical sources and find out what National Socialist was about and whether Whoopi was right or wrong.<br /><br />And no, I'm NOT a National Socialist, or a Fascist, or a Marxist, nor any other type of evil ideologue. The purpose of this video is to study history so that we don't repeat the mistakes of the past. So while I will be discussing concepts such as the Holocaust, and race, and Antisemitism, that doesn't mean that I'm promoting the aforementioned ideologies.<br /><br />Follow me on Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tikhistory/">https://www.instagram.com/tikhistory/</a><br /><br />‚è≤Ô∏è Videos EVERY Monday at 5pm GMT (depending on season, check for British Summer Time).<br /><br />The thumbnail for this video was created by Terri Young.

I also want to dispel the myths and distortions that ruin our perception of the past by asking a simple question - ‚ÄúBut is this really the case?‚Äù. I have a 2:1 Degree in History and a passion for early 20th Century conflicts (mainly WW2). I‚Äôm therefore approaching this like I would an academic essay. Lots of sources, quotes, references and so on. Only the truth will do.<br /><br />This video is discussing events or concepts that are academic, educational and historical in nature. This video is for informational purposes and was created so we may better understand the past and learn from the mistakes others have made.{% endraw %}
