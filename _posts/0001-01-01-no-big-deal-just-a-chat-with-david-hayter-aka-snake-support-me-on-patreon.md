Join me and my co-host of Shadow Moses Cafe, Shaine Smith, as we sit down with the man behind Big Boss and Solid Snake, the multi-talented actor/screenwriter/all around awesome dude David Hayter! Along the way we discuss MGSV, favorite games, and behind the scenes stuff like the one time David can remember finding it hard to 'sell' a line, or how little time the voice actors were given before having to record Codec calls. All around, a great talk!<br /><br />I had to re-record my parts, so apologies on that front.{% endraw %}
