(1/2&quot; Plywood Vs. 3/4&quot; Plywood--When to Use)<br /><br />Many new woodworkers and DIYers rush to use 3/4&quot; plywood for any small project. But, in many cases, 3/4&quot; plywood is overkill! This short video from The Honest Carpenter will show you a better alternative for many DIY projects--1/2&quot; plywood!<br /><br />1/2&quot; plywood comes in nearly every variety that 3/4&quot; plywood does. It's extremely strong and stable.<br /><br />Many people seem to avoid 1/2&quot; plywood on the assumption that it's weak. But, it has many of the same properties as 3/4&quot; plywood.<br /><br />(3/4&quot; is a much more common measurement for wood in general--this may be one of the reasons that people assume that they need to purchase 3/4&quot; plywood.)<br /><br />BENEFITS OF 1/2&quot; PLYWOOD:<br />--It's lighter (by almost 20 lbs. per sheet)<br />--It's cheaper (by $10-12 on overage per sheet)<br />--It's easier on tools<br />--It produces less sawdust<br />--It is easier to handle and manipulate<br />--It has an edge just wide enough to be hit with brads and trim nails<br /><br />SITUATIONS WHERE 3/4&quot; PLYWOOD IS PREFERRED:<br />--Anything that will be walked on<br />--Anything that will be hit hard with tools<br />--Anything that will be roughly handled.<br /><br />TIPS FOR WORKING WITH 1/2&quot; PLYWOOD:<br />--Try not to span it more than 24&quot; unsupported in any direction<br />--Get support directly beneath the edges<br />--Use glue when bonding pieces<br />--Use face frames for additional support on trim projects<br /><br />Thanks for watching!
