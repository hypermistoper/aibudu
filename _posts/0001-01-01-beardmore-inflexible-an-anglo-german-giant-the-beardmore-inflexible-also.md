{% raw %}The Beardmore Inflexible, also known as the Rohrbach VI, was a giant shoulder-wing monoplane that was developed in the late 1920s. There was interest in the development of an all-metal heavy aircraft, and German aircraft designer Adolf Rohrbach worked in collaboration with British manufacturer Bearmore to create a giant aircraft.<br /><br />The Inflexible proved the feasibility of all-metal aircraft and large monoplanes, it was also considered quite stable and easy to fly. However it was under-powered, which hurt interest in the project. Combined with the financial crash in 1929, this resulted in little further interest and no production models were ordered.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Producing these videos is a hobby of mine. I have a passion for history, and personally own a large collection of books, journals and other texts, and endeavor to do as much research as possible. However if there are any mistakes, please don't hesitate to reach out and correct anything :)<br /><br />Sources:<br />British Prototype Aircraft - Ray Sturtivant, 1990<br />Beardmore Aviation 1913-1930 - Charles Mac Kay, 2012{% endraw %}
