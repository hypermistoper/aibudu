{% raw %}“It was counterintuitive because Pfizer was mastering or let's say we had very good experience and expertise with multiple technologies that could give a vaccine…mRNA was the technology that we had less experience with, only two years working on this. And actually, MRNA was a technology that never delivered a single product until that day. Not vaccine, not any other medicine, so it was very counterintuitive.”- Albert Bourla{% endraw %}
