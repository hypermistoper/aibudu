{% raw %}Summary<br />To recap - there’s the classical, lectin binding, and alternative complement pathway.<br /><br />The classical pathway begins with an antibody bound to a pathogen, the lectin binding pathway begins with mannose binding lectin protein binding mannose, and the alternative pathway is always active because there’s always some C3 being cleaved into C3a and C3b.<br /><br />All three pathways end with the creation of the MAC which will kill a pathogen, and along the way there’s creation of C3a and C5a - both acting as chemotaxins and anaphylatoxins, and C3b acting as opsonins which will help phagocytes grab and destroy pathogens - like forks on a meatball!{% endraw %}
