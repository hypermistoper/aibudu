{% raw %}In the beginning of 2010, the Playing For Change crew began work on a new Song Around the World, John Lennon's &quot;Imagine.&quot; It has been an amazing year of production, taking the crew from the favelas of Brazil to the shrines of southern India, from villages in Nepal to the glittering urban landscape of Tokyo and New York, and beyond.<br /><br />This song is the Playing For Change Foundation's gift to the world. The Playing For Change Foundation feels honored to have the blessing and generous support of Yoko Ono as music lovers around the world join together to launch the Power to the People campaign. The campaign seeks to advance John Lennon's vision of peace by engaging artists and audiences to contribute to music education programs worldwide. Proceeds raised will help build music schools, support teachers and music programs, purchase instruments, and connect schools for cross-cultural learning and conflict resolution across borders. Music IS the power: Power to the People.<br /><br />To learn more about the PFC Foundation, the schools they are building, the lives they are touching, and how you can participate, please visit the Playing For Change Foundation's website at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://playingforchange.org/">http://playingforchange.org/</a><br /><br /><br />JOIN THE MOVEMENT<br />Subscribe to our mailing list: www.bit.ly/1x9CAfJ<br />Become a member: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/JoinAndSupportPFC">http://bit.ly/JoinAndSupportPFC</a><br /><br />GET SOCIAL<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PlayingForChange">https://www.facebook.com/PlayingForChange</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/playing4change">https://twitter.com/playing4change</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/playing4change">http://instagram.com/playing4change</a><br /><br />Playing For Change (PFC) is a movement created to inspire and connect the world through music, born from the shared belief that music has the power to break down boundaries and overcome distances between people. The primary focus of PFC is to record and film musicians performing in their natural environments and combine their talents and cultural power in innovative videos called Songs Around The World. Creating these videos motivated PFC to form the Playing For Change Band—a tangible, traveling representation of its mission, featuring musicians met along their journey; and establish the Playing For Change Foundation—a separate 501(c)3 nonprofit organization dedicated to building music and art schools for children around the world. Through these efforts, Playing For Change aims to create hope and inspiration for the future of our planet.{% endraw %}
