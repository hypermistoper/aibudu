{% raw %}Suddenly, the Russia Ukraine war has the world contemplating end-time scenarios and the real possibility of nuclear war. Our Lady, the Queen of Peace,  has been warning the world that this time of trial would arrive. She has said: “Satan wants war and hatred”<br /><br />Putin today announced that sanctions against Russia are a declaration of war. As his military laid siege to Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin ordered Russia’s nuclear forces into a higher state of alert, the first time the Kremlin has done so since the Russian Federation was established in 1991.<br />This is unprecedented in the post-Cold War era,<br />Close followers of Medjugorje understand that the month of March has a special significance, particularly the date of March 18th. So within the context of the world conflict March 18, 2022  is  looming larger than ever <br />The Visionary Mirjana has said, for many years, that on March 18 the world will understand why that date was so significant. <br />The visionary says:   “Only when the things contained in the secrets start to happen will the world understand why Our Lady chose March 18. The significance of the date will be clear. Why every second of the month, why Wednesdays and Fridays are days of fasting, everything will be clear on March 18th”{% endraw %}
