{% raw %}Hey Campers!!<br /><br />I have another scary story for you tonight!! This one is about a family who bought 10 acres of wild land and a cabin in the Appalachian  mountains of West Virginia. There they have several encounters over many months that made them decide to sell the cabin and the land and move out. Also I have a scary 911call from 1990 about something a man saw in his backyard one night!!<br /><br />Keep Hiking!!<br />Base Camp Chris<br /><br />Travel Nevada<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://travelnevada.com/">https://travelnevada.com/</a><br /><br />West Virginia Travel<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wvtourism.com/">https://wvtourism.com/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Pond 5<br />Bigfoot 2<br />0:07 | stereo | wav | 2.2MB<br />Item ID: 32347995<br />0:07 | WAV<br /><br />Individual License Commercial<br />$29.95{% endraw %}
