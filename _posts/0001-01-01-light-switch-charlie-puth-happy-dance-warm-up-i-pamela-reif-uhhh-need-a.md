{% raw %}Uhhh need a mood booster? ♥︎ I love the choreography! Perfect as a warm up or as a 3min „smile guarantee“ / Werbung <br /><br />This Song Workout is inspired by the moves you can see in the actual music video of „Light Switch“. <br />I tried to combine everything, match it to the beats and turn it into a full workout. Hope youuuu like it! <br /><br />This video works perfectly:<br />- as a warm up. My 45min Dance Workout Plan (in my app) always uses Song Workouts to start your workout day :) <br />- as a short &amp; sweet mood booster <br />- to get your heart rate up in between other videos<br /><br />__<br /><br />„Light Switch“ is also in my workout playlist.
