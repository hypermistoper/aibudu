{% raw %}In this weeks video I show you how I pull and attach handles onto my simple thrown stoneware mugs in a lot more detail. It's a process that simply needs a lot of dedicated practice, just as much as you'd need if you were learning to throw, and I hope this short video provides you with some tips and tricks. <br /><br />Thanks for watching and I'll catch you soon with a new upload.<br />____<br /><br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/floriangadsby/">https://www.instagram.com/floriangadsby/</a><br />TikTok – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@floriangadsby">https://www.tiktok.com/@floriangadsby</a><br />Website – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.floriangadsby.com">http://www.floriangadsby.com</a>{% endraw %}
