{% raw %}In this video we will discuss one of the German anti-tank missiles, namely the Panzerfaust 3 which is used by Ukraine against Russian tanks.<br /><br />The Panzerfaust 3 (asoured fist 3) is a modern single-use recoilless anti-tank weapon, designed and developed by Dynamit Nobel AG between 1978 and 1985, undergoing its first tests in 1986 and put into service by the Bundeswehr West German infantry in 1992.<br /><br />The Panzerfaust 3 was originally designed to defeat the latest Soviet T-72 and T-80 main battle tanks. At the time of its introduction it was one of the highest-performance weapons of its class. Improved versions of the Panzerfaust 3 are still among the most capable anti-tank rocket launchers in the world.<br /><br />The Panzerfaust 3 is known for its compact, lightweight design, which allows it to be fired by a single infantryman. Its ergonomics follow a pre-defined standard, and the controls, including its pistol grip, were designed to be easily handled from all positions.{% endraw %}
