We’ve had 30 recessions between 1869 and 2018. Now of those 30, 16 recessions have had a positive stock market return from when they started - to when they finished. <br /><br />The positive stock market recessions lasted on average - 16 months and stocks ranged a return between 0.7% to 38.1% with an average return of 9.8% despite the fact that the GDP declined on average 3%.<br /><br /> HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE?<br />They found the correlation between recessions as measured by the GDP growth and the stock-market at nearly -0.05. So it’s almost 0 correlation between a recession and the stock market. The 14 recessions when the stock market went down, lasted 18 months on average, with an average return of -14.2%.<br /><br />SHOULD I SELL ALL MY STOCKS?<br />In order to beat a buy-and-hold return of 9.0% over the last 150 years, an investor would have to successfully predict 77% of the market turns —and move in and out of stocks/cash as appropriate (Russell Investments: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://russellinvestments.com/us/blog/us-stock-market-recession-history).">https://russellinvestments.com/us/blog/us-stock-market-recession-history).</a><br /><br />Even if you knew for sure when a recession was coming, the odds of losing or making money is about 50/50. History says it's nearly impossible to time the market.<br /><br />MY INVESTING STRATEGY<br />Watch the video to find out!<br /><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://russellinvestments.com/us/blog/us-stock-market-recession-history">https://russellinvestments.com/us/blog/us-stock-market-recession-history</a><br /><br />*None of this is meant to be construed as investment advice, it's for entertainment purposes only.
