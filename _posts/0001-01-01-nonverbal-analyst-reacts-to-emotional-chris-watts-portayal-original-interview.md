Despite my best efforts, the only way I could find it was through a sketchy website. I cannot in good conscience suggest you risk your device to watch it. However, here is this heavily edited version that somehow squeaked past YouTube’s copyright system: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/VEIMmkDxjxE">https://youtu.be/VEIMmkDxjxE</a><br /><br />Christopher Lee Watts was born in May of 1985. In 2018, he admitted to murdering his pregnant wife by strangulation. He later also admitted to killing their daughters by smothering them with a blanket. On November 6, 2018, Watts pleaded guilty to multiple counts of first-degree murder as part of a plea deal when the death penalty was removed from sentencing. He was sentenced to five life sentences without the possibility of parole, three to be served consecutively.<br /><br />Actor Sean Kleier was born in March of 1987 in Louisville, Kentucky, While he is mostly known for his role in Antman vs Wasp, today we are comparing his nonverbal portrayal of Watts in the 2020 movie Chris Watts: Confessions of a Killer to the actual person to see if his performance lines up with Watts’ behavior in the actual footage.<br /><br />Save Money on Your College Degree<br />Observe is partnered with the Emotional Intelligence Academy in the UK to offer discounts of 10%-50% on your education including a fully accredited Master's Degree!
