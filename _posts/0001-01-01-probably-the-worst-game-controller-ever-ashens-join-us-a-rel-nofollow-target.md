But it took me ages to get hold of The Terminator joystick, because for some crazy reason it didn't sell a lot!<br /><br />Game controllers have come a long way since some very odd people decided to snap the top off a joystick and stick a tortoise on top. I am not complaining. These ultra-novelty things are seriously the worst... unless you just put them on a shelf and look at them, or something.<br /><br />Also, let's enjoy the weird irony of a company called Cheetah making a Tortoise!{% endraw %}
