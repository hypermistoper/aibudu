{% raw %}Our new case study can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.830325/full">https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fendo.2022.830325/full</a> – Please share and let us know your comments.<br /><br />Highlights:<br /><br />- Upon adopting a ketogenic diet relatively low in saturated fat (~18% saturated ~82% unsaturated), the patient’s LDL-C increased from 95 mg/dl to a peak of 545 mg/dl<br /><br />- Consistent with prior data (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://doi.org/10.1093/cdn/nzab144)">https://doi.org/10.1093/cdn/nzab144)</a> demonstrating an inverse association between BMI and LDL-C on low-carb diets, moderate weight gain contributed to a drop in LDL-C<br /><br />- Advanced genetic testing, including whole exome and targeting cardiovascular disease panel revealed no genetic variations that could explain his presentation<br /><br />- Patient underwent a CCTA after 2.5 years at levels comparable to those found in homozygous FH. No detectable plaque was observed.<br /><br />- Strengths: Patient presents with strong LMHR phenotype despite relatively low sat fat intake, consistent with notation that LMHR phenotype doesn’t require high saturated fat intake; rigorous dietary record keeping and nutrition data extraction; additional exercise and weight tracking; Longitudinal BMI correlates inversely with LDL-C, consistent with prior data; includes advanced genetic testing; includes CCTA at 2.5 years (with time-exposure matched comparison to homozygous FH case)<br /><br />- Limitations: N = 1. Caution: Should not be generalized to other patient cases. Patient is young and relatively short timespan. Possible or likely patient will develop plaque in coming years and is at increased ASCVD risk. Highlights need for further study on this phenomenon.{% endraw %}
