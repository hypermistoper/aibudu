Ferris tells fellow colleague Daniela Cambone that part of the problem with recognizing a bear market is, &quot;you don't know when you've entered it,&quot; so it's best, &quot;to prepare, don't predict,&quot; he says. &quot;The Fed is an insidious institution,&quot; Ferris says, based on its historical actions when dealing with large financial crises. Bitcoin is a potentially good store of value, but does not serve well as a currency based on its volatility, he further explains. &quot;We are at a major inflection point, and now more than ever you need to be truly diversified,&quot; Ferris concludes.
