{% raw %}Our Spec Ops, Israel Wright, and Cameron Fath are back again for another episode of Experts Play. This time they will play Call of duty Modern Warzone, for the FIRST TIME.<br />Will they survive to the end? Will they enjoy the GULAG? Watch the video to find out!<br /><br />Did you enjoy this episode? Don’t forget to voice your opinion in the comments below! ﻿<br />﻿<br />Warzone is the second main battle royale installment in the Call of Duty franchise, following the &quot;Blackout&quot; mode of Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 (2018). Warzone differs from Black Ops 4 by reducing reliance on equipable gadgets and instead encouraging the accumulation of a new in-game currency called Cash. Warzone features two primary game modes: Battle Royale and Plunder. It supports up to 150 players in a single match, which exceeds the typical size of 100 players seen in other battle royale titles. Some limited-time modes support 200 players.<br /><br />The Battle Royale mode is similar to other titles in the genre where players compete in a continuously shrinking map to be the last player remaining. Players parachute onto a large game map, where they encounter other players. As the game progresses and players are eliminated, the playable area shrinks, forcing the remaining players into tighter spaces. In Warzone, the non-playable areas become contaminated with a yellow gas that depletes health and eventually kills the player if they do not return to the safe playable area. Unlike other titles, Warzone introduces a greater emphasis on vehicles and a new in-game currency mechanic. Parachuting is unrestricted, with the player being allowed to open and cut their parachute an unlimited number of times while in the air. At launch, the game supported trios (squads of up to three players) with an option to disable squad filling. Four-player squads and Solo BR modes were added in the following updates, while Duos was added near the end of Modern Warfare Season 3.<br /><br />Character death in Battle Royale does not necessarily translate to player defeat like in other titles. Instead, the mode offers a respawn mechanic that players can take advantage of in various ways. Players who are killed are transported to the &quot;Gulag&quot;, where they engage in one-on-one combat with another defeated player, with both players being given the same weaponry. The guns that the players receive have few or no attachments. Players may only enter the gulag after their first death in a match. The winner of this combat is respawned into the game. Other methods of respawning are available using the in-game currency system. Players may use the in-game currency to purchase respawn tokens for other players should they not be revived by the Gulag mechanic.<br />-------------------- <br />Cameron Fath: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/cameroncfath/">https://www.instagram.com/cameroncfath/</a><br />His merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kitgodapparel.com/">https://www.kitgodapparel.com/</a><br />Israel Wright: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/myhappyself2/">https://www.instagram.com/myhappyself2/</a><br />His twitch channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/myhappyself/">https://www.twitch.tv/myhappyself/</a><br />--------------------<br />﻿0:00 Intro<br />0:26 What's Up?<br />1:08 Israel Playing<br />3:05 Cameron Playing<br />5:00 Israel Playing<br />7:36 Cameron Playing<br />9:23 Israel Playing<br />10:53 Cameron Playing<br />13:25 Conclusion<br />--------------------<br />Check out some of our past videos!<br /><br />Spec Ops REACT to Zero Hour | Experts React<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Yi7tHCrPLnY">https://youtu.be/Yi7tHCrPLnY</a><br /><br />The Spec Ops playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/cWZR08_Ue9A">https://youtu.be/cWZR08_Ue9A</a><br />-------------------- <br />Up In My Jam (All Of A Sudden) by - Kubbi <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/kubbi​">https://soundcloud.com/kubbi​</a><br />Creative Commons — Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported— CC BY-SA 3.0<br />Free Download / Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2JnDfCE​">http://bit.ly/2JnDfCE​</a> <br />Music promoted by Audio Library <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/tDexBj46oNI​">https://youtu.be/tDexBj46oNI​</a><br />-------------------- <br />Stay in the loop with us on social media!<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thebestofgaming1/">https://www.facebook.com/thebestofgaming1/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/gamology/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/gamology/?hl=en</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gamologyus​">https://twitter.com/gamologyus​</a><br /><br />Subscribe to our other YouTube channels:<br />Gamology Forecast - Watch out for new exciting games reviews, tips and hacks and MORE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/GamoForecast">https://bit.ly/GamoForecast</a><br />Send Noobs - If you enjoy discovering Free games and VR content, you should definitely subscribe to this channel! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/SendNoobs">https://bit.ly/SendNoobs</a><br />Gamology Shorts will provide you with your daily dose of short gaming content! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/GamoShorts">https://bit.ly/GamoShorts</a><br />-------------------- <br /><br />#Warzone #SpecOps​ #ExpertsReact<br /><br />Spec Ops PLAY Warzone for the FIRST TIME | Experts Play{% endraw %}
