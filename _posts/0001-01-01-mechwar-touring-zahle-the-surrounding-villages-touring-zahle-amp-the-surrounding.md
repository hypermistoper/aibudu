With around 150,000 inhabitants, it is the fourth largest city in Lebanon after Beirut, Tripoli, and Sidon and the fourth largest taking the whole urban area (the Jounieh urban area is larger).<br />Zahlé is located 55 km (34 mi) east of the capital Beirut, close to the Beirut-Damascus road, and lies at the junction of the Lebanon mountains and the Beqaa plateau, at a mean elevation of 1,000 m. Zahlé is known as the &quot;Bride of the Beqaa&quot; and &quot;the Neighbor of the Gorge&quot; for its geographical location and attractiveness, but also as &quot;the City of Wine and Poetry&quot;. Zahle is called &quot;Dar el Salam&quot; which means home of peace[citation needed]. It is famous throughout Lebanon and the region for its pleasant climate, numerous riverside restaurants and quality arak. Its inhabitants are predominantly Greek Catholic and are known in Arabic as Zahlawi.<br /><br />Chtaura (Arabic: شتورا‎) is a town in Lebanon in the fertile Beqaa valley located between the Mount Lebanon and Syria. It is located halfway on the Beirut - Damascus highway. It is located 44 kilometres (27 mi) from Beirut.<br />Chtaura is the valley's hub for banking, transportation, and commerce, with many hotels and restaurants on the main road. From Chtaura, travelers can depart for Zahlé, Baalbek, or Damascus.<br />A few kilometers south from Chtaura on the main road lies the village of Tannayal (from the Aramaic word for &quot;the Grace of God&quot;). An estate that has been converted to a farm and retreat centre in Ignatian spirituality, owned by the Jesuit fathers since 1860. Exotic fowl including peacocks and doves can be found there.
