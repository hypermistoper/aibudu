{% raw %}Watch The Sunday Game: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.rte.ie/player/ie/show/10157574/">http://www.rte.ie/player/ie/show/10157574/</a><br /><br />Pat Spillane was not impressed with the first half of Cavan v Fermanagh - &quot;The game is called football....there is no skill involved in handpassing the ball to the man alongside you. This game of gaelic football has been infiltrated by a load of spoofers and bluffers with no experience in some cases of gaelic football. We've forgotten the basic principles of the game -- the catch and kick.&quot;{% endraw %}
