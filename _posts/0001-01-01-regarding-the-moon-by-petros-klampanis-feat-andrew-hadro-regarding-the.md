{% raw %}'Regarding the Moon' is a new composition of mine, commissioned and performed by Andrew Hadro, baritone saxophonist in New York City. Hadro began working on the concept in the early days of the pandemic as a way to give work to composers during the global performance outage. It is written for double string quartet (four violin, two viola, two cello), bass, piano, drums and features the baritone saxophone. It utilises the extreme upper register of the baritone saxophone, a range and timbre rarely used by composers.<br /><br />The title is both a reference to the extreme upper reaches of saxophone range and a nod to composer Claude Debussyâ€™s 'Clair de Lune'. The piece is so technically difficult that Hadro spent months re-learning the altissimo range of the baritone saxophone, while the recording took nearly 18 months to complete on two continents with sessions months apart.<br /><br />Download the track on Bandcamp: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/PKmusic_Moon">https://bit.ly/PKmusic_Moon</a><br /><br />released December 24, 2021<br /><br />Andrew Hadro: baritone saxophone<br />Martha Kato: piano<br />Petros Klampanis: bass<br />Rogerio Boccato: drums<br /><br />Dionisis Vervitsiotis, Migen Selmani, Haralambos Karasavidis,<br />Pericles Timplalexis: violin<br />Enkela Kokolani, Krystalia Gaitanou: viola<br />Marina Kolovou, Fabiola Ojeda: cello<br /><br />Composition, production: Petros Klampanis<br /><br />Video by Adrien H.
