{% raw %}If bitcoin price drops another $8k and we break a key support level my prediction is bitcoin will crash around 60% to put in our 2022 bitcoin bottom very soon. I believe the stock market has entered a bear market therefore bitcoin will continue dropping to much lower price targets and the bitcoin bottom is a lot nearer than most think. The last bitcoin price pump was a bull trap to sucker in retail before a larger dump..  Remember bitcoin follows the indices, so if the stock market is up that is bullish for bitcoin.. If the stock market starts crashing that is bearish for bitcoin. The only 2022 bull run we are in right now is with the DXY / US Dollar..  As markets continue to tank I expect the DXY to moon! The 2022 bitcoin &amp; stock market bubble has popped so i expect much more downside.
