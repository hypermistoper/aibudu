{% raw %}#Keybored PREMIUM Custom Keyboard for ENTRY Price | QK65 by Qwertykeys (Owlab)<br /><br />Too many times, there are claims made about the next &quot;BEST Entry Enthusiast&quot; Keyboard on the market.  However, with the QK65 by Qwerty Keys (Owlabs Sister Company), it's the TRUTH.  I won't belabor it... this is the best &quot;ENTRY&quot; keyboard you can buy... Because this is not really an &quot;ENTRY&quot; Keyboard at all... it's a PREMIUM board disguised by its $150 Price Tag.<br /><br />This video is sponsored by CableMod!
