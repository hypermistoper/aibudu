{% raw %}ðŸ§¿ Part 3 - We wanted to fill the nursery with all the love we can before the arrival of our new addition! We painted the walls and now doing a simple mural to brighten up the walls. Zazu and Walle as always have been great helpers throughout. They surely know something is going on.<br />We are truly grateful and feel blessed by these moments. We will be posting move videos as we go...<br /><br />Follow Zazu and Walle<br /><br />Instagram : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/zazutalks/â€‹">https://www.instagram.com/zazutalks/â€‹</a> <br /><br />Facebook page : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Zazutalks/â€‹">https://www.facebook.com/Zazutalks/â€‹</a> <br /><br />Email us : Zazutalks@gmail.com<br /><br />#GermanShorthairedPointerâ€‹ #Labradorâ€‹ #Nursery{% endraw %}
