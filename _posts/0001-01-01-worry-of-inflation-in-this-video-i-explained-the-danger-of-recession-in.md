{% raw %}In this video, I explained the danger of recession in the coming months. GDP fell by 1.4% in the first quarter of 2022. The yield curve inverted just 3 weeks ago. Inflation is breaking new records every week. Finally, S&amp;P 500 is down 13% and QQQ is down 22%. We are currently experiencing Stagflation. If we have just one more negative quarter of growth, we will be in a recession based on traditional definitions. So in this video, I broke down what just happened and the potential impact for us. This information will enable us to be prepared and to make the most out of the situation! <br /><br />🏆 The basic investment training link is here. 🏆<br />→ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gwschool.com/">https://gwschool.com/</a><br /><br />💥 Follow me on Social Media 💥 <br />→ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/332B84S">https://bit.ly/332B84S</a><br />→ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3mWPrPG">https://bit.ly/3mWPrPG</a><br />→ LinkedIn:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3sYUYc9">https://bit.ly/3sYUYc9</a>{% endraw %}
