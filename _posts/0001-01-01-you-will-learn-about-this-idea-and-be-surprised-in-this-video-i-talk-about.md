{% raw %}In this video, I talk about a cool idea - how to make a hand-made airbrush with your own hands. It will be useful for those who want to close a small product - with paint, varnish or glue. It is suitable for any work, and is made very simply and cheaply from improvised materials. Of course, this is not a real replacement for a spray gun, but sometimes it is enough. Enjoy watching!{% endraw %}
