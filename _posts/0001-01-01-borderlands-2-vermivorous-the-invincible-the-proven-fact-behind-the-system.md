{% raw %}{THE PROVEN FACT WAY OF SPAWNING VERMIVOROUS THE INVINCIBLE:}<br /><br />{HOW IT WORKS:} <br /> <br />The spawn for him is COMPLETELY RANDOM and decided as soon as the Larval Kid's spawns. Larval Varkid's as soon as they spawn are already coded-pre determined if that Varkid is the said &quot;Chosen One&quot; and if it is it will complete its full evolution cycle.<br /><br />If the Larval Kid is going to evolve, it will do it within five minutes (most likely, it will do it within 2). If not, it will just run around endlessly.<br />If you want proof this is how it actually works, just go fight a normal varkid. If it remains a larval it will sit there for hours (not destined to evolve not a &quot;Chosen One&quot;.<br /><br />{THEORIES/RUMORS/SPECUALTIONS:}<br /><br />The 5 well know suggested theories/speculations running rampant on the internet so far of spawning Vermivorous.<br /><br />(Q1.) Make a Ultimate Badass Varkid kill enemies threshers Etc: in order to evolve...<br /><br />(A1.) Varkid's are not GOLIATH's = BULLSHIT<br /><br />(Q2.) The more Varkids the more Chance of Spawning a Vermivorous.<br /><br />(A2.)The more Varkids the more evolution well yes.. the more Varkids present the more chance of having one of them being a &quot;Chosen One&quot; but you could have 2 or 3 Ultimate's but if there not destined to evolve they wont.. = BULLSHIT<br /><br />(Q3.) Reducing Varkid's health to 1/8 will force them to evolve due to danger of death.<br /><br />(A3.) I have spawned a Vermivorous in caustic cavners without touching/damaging the Ultimate = BULLSHIT<br /><br />Q4.) Equipping a &quot;Blood of Terramorphus Relic&quot; Increases chances of Vermivorous spawning<br /><br />A4.) This one im still not sure about.. i do know 100% thats it is not &quot;Essential/Must Have&quot; to have equipped to make him spawn but i doubt it helps at all.. since it is not essential.<br /><br />Q5.) The more players in the game the more chance of spawning Vermivorous.<br /><br />A5.) Although its possible to spawn Vermivorous by yourself &quot;Gearbox&quot; The Developers said on the official forums that the odds of spawning a Vermivorous Playing Solo are something like 1/2000!. But With 4 people its about 1/60. So with 4 players a little luck and patience he's not that hard to find with 4 people.<br /><br />Peace out{% endraw %}
