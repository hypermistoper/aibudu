{% raw %}What is a destination charge? A destination charge, also called a delivery fee, freight fee or transportation fee, is the fee that an auto manufacturer charges the customer to deliver the vehicle from the factory to the dealership. The dealer does not include this in the ticket price.  Whether you’re buying a car at the dealership or from home, you can save time by knowing what to expect. That includes destination fees, sometimes called a destination charge, freight fee, or even freight delivery charge. If you aren’t familiar with additional dealer fees, it can be confusing to know which ones you should be prepared to pay for.  A destination fee is the amount that manufacturers charge dealers to ship a new car onto the dealership lot. The amount often isn’t factored into the sale price of the vehicle, so when you’re getting a quote make sure to ask if the destination fee is included and how much it will add. If there’s an asterisk next to the price, there’s a good chance that the price doesn’t account for the fee.<br /><br />Best Site for New Car Quotes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://quotes.everymandriver.com/">https://quotes.everymandriver.com/</a><br />Best Site to Used Car Quotes:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://quotes.everymandriver.com/bestuseddeals">https://quotes.everymandriver.com/bestuseddeals</a><br /><br />Venmo Me: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://venmo.com/IMDaveErickson">https://venmo.com/IMDaveErickson</a><br />CashApp Me: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cash.app/$IMDaveErickson">https://cash.app/$IMDaveErickson</a><br />PayPal Me: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/DaveEricksonMedia">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/DaveEricksonMedia</a><br /><br />Article by Aaron Cole with the Car Connection: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1124280_what-automaker-charges-the-most-for-destination-charges">https://www.thecarconnection.com/news/1124280_what-automaker-charges-the-most-for-destination-charges</a><br /><br />Shop the Best Selling Auto Parts Here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2CQmxLz">https://amzn.to/2CQmxLz</a> <br /><br />Product Review Video Playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRXIjIyqSWlhfsfv7ziGX5N3O80K07D5u">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRXIjIyqSWlhfsfv7ziGX5N3O80K07D5u</a>{% endraw %}
