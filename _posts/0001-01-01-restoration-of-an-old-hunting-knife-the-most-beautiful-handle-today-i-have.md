{% raw %}Today I have an old hunting knife for restoration.<br />This is a knife of one of four in the lot that I purchased!<br />There is one oddity, none of these knives have a handle, although there are pins for mounting!<br /><br />Restoration process.<br /><br />I used electrolysis for rust removal, I used a steel plate as an anode, and the knife itself was the cathode!<br />For the handle I chose a block of stabilized wood (our craftsmen make them of amazing beauty!!!). In this state, the wood is much harder and denser than a regular bar, thus my new handle will be ETERNAL)))!<br />I also used a special spacer for knife handles (G10, 1 mm).<br />I assembled everything with epoxy glue, during assembly I lost my nail on the finger of my left hand (do not try to twist something with a screwdriver if this part is in your palm), could not work for two days, and then completed the processing of the handle.<br />I treated the handle with wood oil, hand polished it with a cotton ribbon, and was amazed by the beauty of the stabilized wood!!!<br /><br />I really liked the result, I hope you do too.<br />There are many more cool and interesting videos on the channel, I will be grateful if you watch some of them!<br /><br />Good luck to you all and take care of yourself!<br /><br />See you next week!<br />Best regards Max!<br /><br />#rusty <br />#knife<br />#restoration{% endraw %}
