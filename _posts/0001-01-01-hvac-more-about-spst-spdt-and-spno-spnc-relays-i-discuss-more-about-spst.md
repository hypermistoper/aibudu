{% raw %}I discuss more about SPST, SPDT and SPNO-SPNC relays.<br /><br />Attention: Do not try any of what you see in this video at home. It takes at least two years of HVACR schooling to become qualified to learn in the field how to work on heating and air conditioning equipment. Then it takes another three years of apprenticeship training to become competent enough to safely work on heating and air conditioning equipment.<br /><br />To donate cryptic currency:<br />peercoin:    PFCmau4Dx2qm4Ymwog3WFKKMkP7oXJHEjd{% endraw %}
