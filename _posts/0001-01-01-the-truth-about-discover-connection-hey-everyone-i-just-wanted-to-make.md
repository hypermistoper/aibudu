{% raw %}Hey everyone, I just wanted to make a quick post acknowledging the fact that I have kind of disappeared for the past 7 months.<br /><br />The truth is there has been a lot going on in my life and I have been really struggling mentally. So I decided I needed to take some time off to work through some stuff. I'm sorry that I just disappeared and didn't say anything. <br /><br />But Discover Connection isn't over, I've been travelling for the past few months and have been working on a bunch of stories that I am really excited about and I can't wait to show you!<br /><br />Thank you all for the support so far<br /><br />BTW I am looking to bring people onto the team<br />- Editors<br />- Hosts<br />- Researchers<br /><br /><br />Send me an Email at Brad@discoverconnection.ca with examples of your work if you are interested!<br /><br />If you want to support the channel I started a PATREON (not officially launched)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=70631398&amp;fan_landing=true">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=70631398&amp;fan_landing=true</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/discovercon...">https://www.instagram.com/discovercon...</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/discovconnect​">https://twitter.com/discovconnect​</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@discoverconne...">https://www.tiktok.com/@discoverconne...</a><br /><br />Where we get our music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referra...">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referra...</a>{% endraw %}
