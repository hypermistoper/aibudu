{% raw %}Through stories and personal experience, Joe aims to increasing the capacity of those around him to live a life of passion and purpose. Joe’s mantra has always been about increasing the capacity of those around him to live a life of passion and purpose. To do this, he focuses on the intersection of people, experiences, and opportunities with a great sense of intentionality. As a wellness advocate and personal mentor/coach, his concepts and programs help people develop healthy, sustainable habits through self-discovery and a more holistic approach to overall well-being. His programs, systems, and concepts are simple, tangible, and authentic. Committed to living out his concepts, he uses his passion for building community and personal well-being to inspire others to create lasting, positive changes for themselves and those around them. In early 2020, prior to the peak of the pandemic, Joe quit his job as vice-president of the largest and most successful student housing company in Canada. After eight years of dealing with the pressure and stress of a job that was no longer fulfilling, he made the decision to become an entrepreneur and pursue his life’s work full-time. He did so at one of the most chaotic and uncertain times in our history. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
