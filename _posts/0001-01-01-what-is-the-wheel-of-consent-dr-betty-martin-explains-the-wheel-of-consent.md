{% raw %}Dr. Betty Martin explains the Wheel of Consent, a practice of taking turns receiving and giving.<br /><br />Get a free chapter of Betty's new book, The Art of Receiving and Giving: The Wheel of Consent: www.wheelofconsentbook.com/free-chapter.<br /><br />The Wheel of Consent is a model of consent based on, but not requiring, exchanges of touch. The Wheel notes the distinction between the ‘doing’ aspect of the touch dynamic — who is doing — and the ‘gift’ aspect — who it is for.<br /><br />For example, you may be touching another person for their enjoyment, or you may be touching them for your own enjoyment. Both of those dynamics are welcome and needed in different situations, and once the distinction is clear, the entire touch dynamic becomes clear, which brings ease, confidence, self-responsibility and freedom to the interaction.<br /><br />When the dynamics are clear, it becomes apparent how they apply to both touch and non-touch dynamics. Indeed, the application to non-touch dynamics may be of greater import.{% endraw %}
