{% raw %}Win $100 every time at Craps? is a Craps Betting Strategy that is part of our dice advice series. This craps betting strategy is called the Field Press and was submitted by Zach Crowley. This strategy is a field betting progression strategy. On any first win in a sequence you press or parley the win. If you continue to win, you increase your base bet each time with a $5 unit, collecting the rest. Anytime you lose, you back down to a $10 starting bet, and with each continued lose, you chase your lose by going up each time by $5. <br /><br />Support Color Up, Shop here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2z3q5VP">http://amzn.to/2z3q5VP</a><br /><br />Use the link above to do any of your amazon shopping.
