{% raw %}SURPRISE SHOUTOUT: ↓↓↓<br />So today's SURPRISE SHOUTOUT goes to Froxxy Pictures. Please go subscribe to their channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO4a9PMdNAionbtgB23ILsg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO4a9PMdNAionbtgB23ILsg</a> and let's get them to at least 100 to 500 subs and beyond.<br /><br />Buy the gloves shown in this video here on Amazon:<br />→ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2MTehkc">https://amzn.to/2MTehkc</a> (Gold)<br /><br />This video previously had disclaimers here in the video description due to my &quot;Drop your PayPal, Cash App, or Venmo down below for GOOD LUCK ↓↓↓&quot; sign which confused many viewers with thinking this video was a cash giveaway when it in fact is not and as you can see now that sign was trimmed out of the video. That sign was simply just for GOOD LUCK. Good luck from the universe as maybe the right person (not me) will see your comment and donate. In hindsight it was pretty dumb of me to put a sign like that in my videos.<br /><br />Also, my &quot;SUBSCRIBE and you will be RICH&quot; sign you see throughout many of my videos is just my funny channel slogan and is not to be taken too literal as in I will literally give everyone who subscribes tons of money or something ridiculous like that I mean that's how you go broke who am I the government.<br /><br />These videos are for inspiration, motivation, visualization, and law of attraction purposes only.<br /><br />So in today's video I start out with my second SURPRISE SHOUTOUT which if you didn't know I started giving surprise shout outs to some of my loyal subscribers as well as smaller fellow prop money channels that I see potential in. These surprise shout outs will continue to be in all of my future non unboxing/review videos where there's no talking. Anyway again go subscribe to Froxxy Pictures here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO4a9PMdNAionbtgB23ILsg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO4a9PMdNAionbtgB23ILsg</a><br /><br />Here's how you can get a SURPRISE SHOUTOUT: ↓↓↓<br />If you want a SURPRISE SHOUTOUT then make sure to stay active on my channel. The more I see you supporting my channel in my comment sections then hey you might be the next SURPRISE SHOUTOUT. BTW, I will not be shouting out channels that have no videos up or channels that I see no potential in such as random channels that make random content. I mainly wanna help out the smaller fellow prop money channels here on YouTube as well as just product unboxing/review type channels. However, there can and will be some exceptions if I see a channel that makes really cool and unique out of the box interesting content that is at least decent to a quality level. Your content doesn't need to be amazing, but I need to at least see some potential in it. Again, I will not be shouting out any one of those channels that wanna have 1,000 or fill in the blank number of subs with no actual videos. I'm sure you've seen those lazy annoying channels with a name like &quot;10,000 subs with no videos&quot;. A lot of people these days want to get something, but give nothing in return. People subscribe to your channel because they like the value you're providing in the form of valuable or entertaining content. So why would anyone support a channel named &quot;10,000 subs with no videos&quot;. What value are they getting from a channel with no videos... nothing is the answer. So make sure you at least have a video or two up for a shot at getting a SURPRISE SHOUTOUT.<br /><br />So yeah the wait is finally over and you guys all finally got to see what $1,000,000 in cold hard cash would look like. You're welcome. :)<br /><br />Oh yes yes, comment down below on whether you think the money shown here in this video is real or fake. As always I can't wait to read the comments on this video MUAHAHAHA!!!<br /><br />About This Channel:<br />• Welcome to the PhantomDrawing YouTube channel. My name is William and I'm mainly a YouTube product reviewer nowadays as I have done drawing and sketchbook tours in the past, but in 2018 I've become the most viewed and most subscribed prop money channel on YouTube. I unbox &amp; review all sorts of products that capture my attention, but I now mainly focus on prop money since that's what most of my viewers wanna see and that's where the money's at haha.<br /><br />If you liked this particular video or you wanna see more prop money videos by me.
