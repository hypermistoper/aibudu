{% raw %}South Africa's most successful bubblegum group was formed as a part-time studio outfit by Clive Calder and Peter Vee in the late 1960s. The group consisted of Clive Calder (guitar, vocals), Robert Schroder (keyboards), Neil Herbert (guitar, vocals), Greg Brown (bass), Howie Jones (drums) and Peter Vee (vocals). Moose Forer (bass) and Ivor Back (drums) played on certain tracks.<br /><br />This song was released on 7' single and on the album &quot;Backstreet and other great hits&quot; in 1970 (best guess). It reached number 2 on the South African Top 20 in 1970, charting for 14 weeks.{% endraw %}
