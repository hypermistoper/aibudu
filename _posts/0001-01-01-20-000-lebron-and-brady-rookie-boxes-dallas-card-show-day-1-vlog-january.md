{% raw %}Welcome to Dallas Day 1!!! Ladies and Gentlemen... We were able to see Lebron James And Tom Brady's Rookie hobby boxes at this show. Can you imagine opening this box to pull the 2000 bowman chrome Tom Brady Rookie or the 2003 Topps Chrome for Lebron James Rookie? I saw a lot of sports cards that I don't always get to see at shows. <br /><br />The Dallas Card Show was one of the best shows we have been to since the National Card Show. Mojo Sports set up at the show as a dealer, and we walked around to buy cards, trade, and hang out. A lot of awesome sports card collections, collectors, and overall just a great show.<br /><br />Do you want $10 to spend on Whatnot App?
