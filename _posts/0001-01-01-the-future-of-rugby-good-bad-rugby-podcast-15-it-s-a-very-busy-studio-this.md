{% raw %}It’s a very busy studio this week, as Tinds, Ellis and Alex try to nail down what rugby’s trying to be and where it needs to get to. They’re joined by the President of Roc Nation, Michael Yormark, the sharpest dressed person to have ever graced the pod, and the man leading the charge to create superstars within the game. Dragons Rugby owner, David Buttress and Newcastle Falcons owner, Semore Kurdi are also on hand to discuss the salary cap, marquee players, TV deals, financial partners, the impact of covid and ultimately how rugby needs to change to continue to grow; which gets a bit fiery at times. And of course, they get into Ellis’ reasons for heading home to Bristol at the end of the season.{% endraw %}
