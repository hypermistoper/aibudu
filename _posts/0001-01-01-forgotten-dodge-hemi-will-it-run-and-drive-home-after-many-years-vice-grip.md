{% raw %}I do the right thing again, and buy a car site unseen.  But, this time it's OK since it's a mopar with a HEMI.  After some basic maintenance and closing the eyes to the &quot;bad&quot; stuff, we'll try a first start in a few years.  Think we'll get it running?  Well if we do, it's 200 miles home!
