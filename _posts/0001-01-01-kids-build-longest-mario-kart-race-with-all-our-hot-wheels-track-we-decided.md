{% raw %}We decided to make our own Mario Kart Raceway using all our Hot Wheels track that we own! It's like our other video we made with Hot Wheels Mario Kart Rainbow Road Raceway but LONGER, going all the way through our kitchen and living room! The Hot Wheels cars we race are Mario, Luigi, Yoshi, Toad, Princess Daisy, Baby Mario, Diddy Kong and Donkey Kong! Who is the fastest car, and more importantly, we will ever be able to finish making the track?! <br /><br />#Kids2Kids #HotWheels #MarioKart<br /><br />MARIO KART Rainbow Road Raceway UNBOXING + Downhill Racing (ft.
