Last December, after 7 years, my client Rebecca finally told her &quot;best friend&quot; that she liked him.  But not just as a friend.  She REALLY liked him.  And she wanted him to know so she didn't have to keep pretending that they were only close friends.<br /><br />But Rebecca committed one of the cardinal sins.  She desired the potential relationship too much.  And she displayed her neediness without realizing it.<br /><br />This desperate energy can be projected to men even if you don't think you're needy or don't realize you're displaying it.<br /><br />That's why I needed to release this video so you can let a guy know you're truly interested in him without scaring him away.<br /><br />Watch this video and let me know what you found most helpful in the comments.{% endraw %}
