But the move they did was they they they have been restricting it in these ways for so long that they can say establishing through legislation an unrestricted right to abortion would well that's not the status quo because we've done all these things in all these areas and all these states and all these regions where accesses are restricted in all these ways. But I mean you know they can't quite come up with I don't think a coherent like what the worst-case scenario is of just sort of enshrining the right in law. So it's just saying like well you know there as you say it would just be extra it would be or abortion plus. It would just be extra abortion if we did this. Because they don't have a coherence they don't have a coherent justification.{% endraw %}
