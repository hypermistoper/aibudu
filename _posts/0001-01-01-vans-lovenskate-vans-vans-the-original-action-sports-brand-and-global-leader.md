{% raw %}Vans, the original action sports brand and global leader in skateboarding for more than 50 years, is proud to partner with the East London-based skate brand, Lovenskate on a customisable 3-piece collection.<br /><br />Friends since way back, Vans and Lovenskate have a long history of collaboration –including screen printing at events over the years, shared team riders and a joint love for customizing shoes and clothes. It was about time the relationship went from friends to lovers – and so the first official collaboration came to life. This spring, Vans and Lovenskate will launch a blank canvas collection that truly embodies the core ethos of creative expression that both brands continue to champion on and off the board.<br /><br />The collection includes two of Vans’ most iconic styles – the Skate Sk8-Hi and Skate Slip-On. Both styles are made with plain white heavyweight canvas and all white foxing, ensuring they’re 100% customizable. A literal blank canvas, each pair comes with a pack of coloured Sharpie pens to customise the shoes and a special edition shoe box unfolds to reveal stencils and a customisation guide. The icing on the cake is a premium pocket tee in white (of course) that also features a specially modified chest pocket cleverly designed to fit a Sharpie pen.<br /><br />Lovenskate was created by Stu Smith in 2001 who operates as a screen printer from his East London studio. Stu was printing zines, t-shirts and skateboards for other brands before deciding to start his own take on what a skateboard company should be. With a very British tagline of ‘Drink Tea, get rad’ the very British pastime of a ‘cup of tea’ is ingrained within Lovenskate.<br /><br />To celebrate the collaboration, Vans and Lovenskate team riders including Jordan Thackeray, Lucy Adams and Schianta “Taylor” Lepori, took a little trip to Spain.<br /><br />Music Credits:<br />Song: “Evolution”<br />Artist: Melvin Ukachi<br />Album: “Evolution (Bring Back The Ofege Beat)<br /><br />Subscribe now at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/vans?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/vans?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Connect with Vans: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.vans.com   ">http://www.vans.com   </a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/vans">http://www.facebook.com/vans</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/vans">http://www.twitter.com/vans</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/vans">http://www.instagram.com/vans</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.tiktok.com/@vans">http://www.tiktok.com/@vans</a><br /><br />About Vans:<br />Vans®, a VF Corporation (NYSE: VFC) brand, is the original action sports footwear, apparel, and accessories brand.
