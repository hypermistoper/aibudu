{% raw %}Recently had to purchase another vehicle due to an accident. I was able to salvage the Radio and the LED lights I had installed and want to install them into this vehicle. This video is a disassembly instructional on removal of the top dash pad and the plastic cover around the radio and instrument cluster. There will be links to the separate videos on cluster removal and radio swapping at the end of this one. <br /><br />Adapter used was the Scosche SN1527B.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br />----------------------------<br />Like my content?
