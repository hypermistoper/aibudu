{% raw %}Remarkable has sent me this link to use for my friends that gives £40 off the device, so if you would like to buy the Remarkable and get £40 off, please follow this link: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://remarkable.com/referral/3TRV-5EFR">https://remarkable.com/referral/3TRV-5EFR</a> <br /><br />P.S. I don't get anything for you using the link, so use it or don't use it, but as it saves £40 there should be no downside if you will buy the device anyway. <br /><br />My original review of the Remarkable 2 is here:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/W2b-JuZciNM">https://youtu.be/W2b-JuZciNM</a><br /><br />So it's about a year on from my original Remarkable 2 review. I am so grateful that the review I did has had so many views and positive feedback as it has shaped the YouTube journey that I am on. However, one year later, although a lot of that review is still relevant today, a few things have changed. Not least the arguably controversial Remarkable Connect software subscription, for which Remarkable has taken away features for new users only to give them back if they pay a monthly fee.<br /><br />In this video, I have looked at whether or not you should still consider the Remarkable 2 in 2022 as the writing device to choose. <br /><br />I hope you find this video of use; please leave it in the comments box if you have any thoughts, comments, or questions. <br /><br />If you have liked this video, please hit the like button and if you have got down here, please also consider subscribing if you have not already joined me on this YouTube journey.<br /><br />0:00 Intro <br />1:04 Remarkable Connect <br />3:51 Competition<br />8:32 Software Update<br />10:50 Summary{% endraw %}
