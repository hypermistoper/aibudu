{% raw %}The Globebus is the most compact and manoeuvrable motorhome series made by Dethleffs. Featuring the handling of a van and the comfort of a large motorhome, it is a perfect companion for active motorhome owners as well as city tourists – whether as a low profile or as an A Class model. In model year 2022, the Globebus is being equipped with a new, attractive interior design as well as a friendly, fresh appearance – with bright wood and white surfaces and attractive flooring with a modern concrete look. The kitchen is also enhanced through revised positioning of the cooker and sink, which enlarges the work surface. The interior can now optionally be illuminated with the harmonious “Light Moments” lighting system. A new non-slip surface makes it even safer to store items in the rear garage. New twist/quick-release latches on the doors of the rear garage feature increased operating comfort as well as additional safety.<br /><br />In model year 2022, the Globebus will have two lengths and floor plans to choose from: the Globebus 1, with a length of 5.99 metres and a double bed arranged transversely above the rear garage, and the Globebus 6, which is around one metre longer and has single beds arranged lengthwise in the rear. Both floor plans are available as low profile and A Class models. With an entry-level price, this compact motorhome on a Fiat Ducato Light and low-frame chassis is an attractive option for active motorhome drivers who like to go off the beaten track to visit destinations that are difficult to reach with large vehicles but for whom a van offers too little comfort. <br /><br />GLOBEBUS Highlights<br />The van among motorhomes!
