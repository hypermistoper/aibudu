Will Ms. James succeed? Will Trump try to destroy evidence before she can?<br />36:00 How's Trump doing?<br />40:00 Trump Media tried to fund their social network by charging $100 million for phone calls with the Orange One, himself. As expected, this was a bust. Will Trump Org admit defeat, or will they keep embarrassing themselves by their &quot;creative&quot; fundraising? (Note: Sarah is picturing MAGAs going door to door selling expired chocolates, and laughing her behind off) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3tIMyGg">https://bit.ly/3tIMyGg</a><br />45:30 The Supreme Court ruled against Trump--allowing hundreds of pages of documents and other data to be released by the National Archives to the January 6th Committee. What will this ultimately mean for Trump?<br />58:00 Will the Jan. 6 Committee have Cruz, Hawley, etc. give public testimony?<br />1:00:30 News: Trump Organization based $161 million valuation of Scotland golf course on magazine quote: New York AG <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.co/gb37G71iDJ">https://t.co/gb37G71iDJ</a><br />1:07:00 Will the MAGA crowd finally see and admit they were duped when this newly released data becomes known to the public?<br />1:11:00 Why did Justice Thomas vote for Tangolini? Did he do it because of his spouse? <br />1:14:30 Will a leader emerge (yet unknown) who will squash the MAGA crappolla and unite the nation firmly under the US Constitution? <br />1:16:30 Will BBB be passed in a new form and put into 2-3 bills? If so, will it pass by the Spring? <br />1:18:15 Will the Voting Rights bill pass? Before 2024?<br /><br />1:22:00 Will the U.S. lose its democracy?<br /><br />1:24:30 SCOTUS is preparing to rule on a case (completely engineered by and benefitting Ted Cruz) that would basically allow politicians the right to loan their campaigns an infinite amount of money--and charge whatever they want in interest for repayment. This case could also remove the $250k cap for donating to a campaign that exists currently under the guise of &quot;free political speech.&quot; Will politicians, once again, be able to use their campaigns to infinitely line their pockets? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3KvUh0v">https://bit.ly/3KvUh0v</a><br />1:27:00 &quot;Mary L Trump @MaryLTrump - Holy sh*t: Mitch McConnell: &quot;African-American voters are voting in just as high a percentage as American voters.&quot; Toni Morrison: &quot;In this country, American means white.
