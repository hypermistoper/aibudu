{% raw %}The first time aircraft were used in a combat role was in World War I, and the landscape of war was changed forever. The fact that these machines could be used to wreak havoc from high above the ground put the side with a stronger aircraft fleet at a much greater advantage. It also meant that those on the ground virtually had nowhere to hide. And some amazing aircraft came from that war, such as the Fokker Triplane and the Sopwith Camel.<br /><br />But it was in WWII that the truly advanced and deadly aircraft came to be. And in it, we saw some of the most amazing flying machines ever built. The Spitfire, the Mustang, and the Lancaster were all machines that emerged from this terrible conflict and are now remembered as iconic airplanes that greatly affected the course of the war and its ending.<br /><br />So, This is the Scariest Aircraft, deadliest, and most successful aircraft to serve in the Second World War.{% endraw %}
