{% raw %}LIVE TRADING CHANNEL: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/TheStockMarket">https://www.youtube.com/TheStockMarket</a><br /><br />The stock market is set to kick off the week with more volatility as Ukraine tensions have pushed NASDAQ futures down 2% before the market has even opened. At the same time, European stocks &amp; China stocks also saw big drawdowns as the world responded to more Ukraine escalation over the weekend. I go over the stock market this week and what to expect and how the Ukraine situation will effect markets. Despite the schedule of Fed speakers this week, it looks like global tensions may be the spotlight and put any rate worries in the back seat. S&amp;P &amp; Nasdaq futures dropped while gold &amp; oil futures went up, pointing to a safe haven demand that will outweigh any rate hike pricing. I go over all of these events and my predictions, then I go over the 3 stocks to buy this week and how I will be eyeing defensive stocks like ABBV &amp; HD.
