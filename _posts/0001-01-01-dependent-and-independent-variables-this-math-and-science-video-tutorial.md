{% raw %}This math and science video tutorial shows you how to identify the dependent and independent variables so you which data to plot on the x axis and on the y-axis.  It contains plenty of examples and practice problems such as word problems.  It shows you if the dependent variable and independent variable is x or y and it discusses the relationship of certain graphs such as linear curves, inverse relationships, and quadratic or parabolic functions.  Examples include Newton's second law of motion between force, mass, and acceleration, boyle's law of pressure and volume in chemistry, and distance vs time under constant acceleration in physics.  It also explains the difference between the control group and the experimental group.  The slope of the line for the force mass example is acceleration.{% endraw %}
