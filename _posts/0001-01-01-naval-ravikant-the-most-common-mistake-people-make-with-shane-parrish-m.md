But circumstances only reveal parts of oneself, which then causes the emotion. So, all conflicts are essentially self-conflicts.<br /><br />- Practical problems to solve in the external world -- Food, shelter... (ensure survival)<br />• Once that is covered, problems are better solved in the &quot;internal world&quot; (self-examination).<br /><br />✎ ✎ ✎✎ ✎ ✎✎ ✎ ✎✎ ✎ ✎  ✎ ✎ ✎ ✎ ✎ ✎✎ ✎ ✎✎ ✎ ✎✎✎✎✎✎✎<br /><br />#NavalRavikant #Mistakes<br /><br /><br /> 🎶 🎶 🎶  🎶 🎶 🎶  🎶 🎶 🎶   Music Credits  🎶 🎶 🎶  🎶 🎶 🎶  🎶 🎶 🎶 <br /><br />🎸 LoFi Beats<br /><br />- Purrple Cat – Wanted<br />- Provided by Lofi Records<br />- Watch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/hFkVYi8hJmk">https://youtu.be/hFkVYi8hJmk</a><br />- Download/Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fanlink.to/AdventureIsland">https://fanlink.to/AdventureIsland</a><br /><br />📥 | Download this music (free)<br />→ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lofigirl.com/blogs/releases/adventure-island">https://lofigirl.com/blogs/releases/adventure-island</a><br /><br />*****<br />DISCLAIMER: Links included in this description might be affiliate links.
