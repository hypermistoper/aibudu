{% raw %}This bike park has crazy MTB slopestyle features and trails! I visit Bugs Boarding which has loads of sick MTB gap jumps, trails and slopestyle features that know where else has in the UK, which one was your favourite?<br /><br />Bugs Boarding park is primarily a mountain board centre but they have recently just added in some awesome mountain bike stuff with a 4x track, berm trail and some huge jumps to get absolutely sendy on! There is also a huge range of mountain board lines that all link together and remind me of the old skool style of slopestyle that I used to compete on back in the day. The hill is littered with crazy features like grind rails, skinnys, wooden kicker ramps and big dirt table tops. I decided to use all 3 of my bikes for today's video and shred this whole bikepark and all of the cool stuff they have to ride. Bt which feature or line was the best and which bike did you prefer out of my dirt jump bike, enduro and ebike? <br /><br />I hope you enjoy the video!<br /><br /><br /><br />MERCH:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tothesky.store/">https://www.tothesky.store/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br /><br />Welcome to my channel, I'm a professional Freeride Mountain biker and former FMB world champion(2013).  <br /><br /><br /><br />This channel is all about Mountain biking, I make a huge variety of videos for everyone who loves dirt: From downhill biking to slower paced trials riding and everything in between like dirt jumping, slopestyle and enduro!  <br /><br /><br /><br />As well as making entertaining videos(I hope) I also like to help YOU out too, with videos such as:  <br /><br />- How to ride better <br /><br />- Trick tips and How to's <br /><br />- Travel VLOGS <br /><br />- GoPro camera tips <br /><br />- In-depth entertaining features <br /><br />- POV craziness <br /><br />- Funny videos <br /><br /><br /><br /> I also try to reply to everyone so leave some comments too!{% endraw %}
