{% raw %}Pop culture can be simply defined as traditions, value systems, and material cultures that are being practiced by the majority of the population. On the surface it may sound extremely simple, but upon closer scrutiny, one will realize that there is more to pop culture than just a set of practices. <br />In its etymological perspective, the words that comprise “pop culture” are eminently relative and arbitrary. Popular, as defined in Cambridge online dictionary, pertains to things, concepts, or persons enjoyed, liked, or admired by most people in a group. On the other hand, culture was defined as a way of life of a specific group of individuals at a particular time (Cambridge Dictionary , n.d.). <br />If we are to examine the definition of popular, we will surely realize that what the word connotes is devoid of constancy. It is in our human nature to have a change of heart in terms of what we like, what we enjoy, and who we admire--the Tamagotchi in the 90’s, the boybands of the early 2000’s and the Crocs of the not so distant past are some tangible examples. On the other hand, the definition of culture also lends itself to being a highly malleable word. Culture moves alongside humanity’s inconstancy—thus making the culture of a particular group of people ever changing, as well. The wide discrepancy of the values and attitudes between the “boomers” and the “millennials” is the most fitting example.{% endraw %}
