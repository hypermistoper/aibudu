{% raw %}I put myself through a 10 day Shakti Warrior Dance course by Alice Bracegirdle (on DailyOM) to see if I can release my divine feminine energy, improve my mood swings and help my PCOS.  It's said that Shakti Warrior Dance, a mix between Kundalini Yoga and dance, has the power to heal women by unblocking the sacred feminine energy that resides in our pelvic region. I was skeptical but after hearing that it helped a lot of women cure anxiety, hormonal disorders and go through spiritual awakenings, I decided to give it a try. To my surprise, it turned out to be one of the most powerful experiences of my life. <br /><br />This is the Shakti Warrior Dance Course I did: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dailyom.com/cgi-bin/courses/courseoverview.cgi?cid=1004">https://www.dailyom.com/cgi-bin/courses/courseoverview.cgi?cid=1004</a> (This is not sponsored, nor an affiliate link.)<br /><br />ðŸ’› *** Don't be a stranger, we love connecting with you guys, the best place to chat is on the gram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/3jBJNi9Ste_RachInstagram">http://bit.ly/3jBJNi9Ste_RachInstagram</a> ***<br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Are you into Spoken Word Poetry?
