{% raw %}WEEELP I've said it before folks but, I love a theme. So here we are, redoing another room in my house because I need to be surrounded by WHIMSY. This time it is the teeny tiny guest bathroom on the first floor, because I want people to be transported when they have to use it, hahaha. ANYWHO I gave myself a few days for this and I think it turned out pretty decent! Not long til every room in my home is a different theme and/or time period ooooops.<br /><br />Chapters:<br />00:00 Intro and Such<br />01:57 Bathroom &quot;Tour&quot;<br />02:48 Design<br />04:55 Peel &amp; Stick Subway Tile<br />09:42 Day Three (Wallpaper &amp; Woodwork)<br />12:45 Fake Paneling<br />13:09 Day Four (Shopping &amp; Painting)<br />18:04 Wall Art &amp; Finishing Touches<br />19:27 Reveal &amp; Tour<br />21:59 Wrap-Up <br /><br />Products:<br />Lights from - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/DECOCREATIONStudio">https://www.etsy.com/shop/DECOCREATIONStudio</a><br />Wallpaper from - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.spoonflower.com/">https://www.spoonflower.com/</a><br />A lot of the wall art from - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/CircaArtCollection">https://www.etsy.com/shop/CircaArtCollection</a><br />Towel &amp; Paper Holders from - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.anthropologie.com/">https://www.anthropologie.com/</a><br /><br />Insta: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rachel.maksy/">https://www.instagram.com/rachel.maksy/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/rachelmaksy/">https://www.facebook.com/rachelmaksy/</a><br />Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rachel-maksy">https://teespring.com/stores/rachel-maksy</a><br />TikTok: @rachelmaksy{% endraw %}
