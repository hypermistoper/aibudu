{% raw %}I wanted to share with you today some of the models of forged irons that we carry. It's a big part of our business and we carry lots of models and I want you to know that we've won lots of awards for our forgings and our innovation in forgings.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.kzgperformancecenter.com">http://www.kzgperformancecenter.com</a> <br />But first, let's talk about the forging process because some of you might not know about it. First we start with a billet of virgin carbon steel. We then heat it to 1200 degrees Celsius. We use a 50 ton forging hammer and when you hit it -- splat -- this is what you get and we cut it out we then take the iron and we heat it up to 800 degrees Celsius and now we -- splat -- hit it again with the 50-ton forging hammer. In the end, what it does is -- all this pressure and all this heat -- we actually compress the molecular structure of the metal.
