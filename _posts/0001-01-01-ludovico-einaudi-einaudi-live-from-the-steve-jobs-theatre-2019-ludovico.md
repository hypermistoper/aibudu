{% raw %}Ludovico Einaudi - Undiscovered<br />Order now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Einaudi.lnk.to/UndiscoveredVD">https://Einaudi.lnk.to/UndiscoveredVD</a><br />Join the official mailing list: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Einaudi.lnk.to/YTMailingList">https://Einaudi.lnk.to/YTMailingList</a><br /><br />The new collection from ground-breaking composer and pianist Ludovico Einaudi, ‘Einaudi Undiscovered’ is out now. A selection of rarities, hidden gems and unreleased tracks handpicked by Einaudi himself from his 25-year career. <br /><br />“Every time I listen to my albums, I realise that each contains one or more highlights that have captured the attention of the listener more than others have. Sometimes, beyond my intentions, some pieces become all-time favourites, while the rest live in the shadows. I have selected songs from different albums and film scores that have been kept more hidden than others, hoping to reveal some of the pieces that I consider as an important part of my repertoire. For me it was nice to look back, brush up my memories, being surprised and somehow rediscover myself, and compose a new necklace made of stones of my past” - Ludovico Einaudi<br /><br />Follow Ludovico Einaudi:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ludovicoeinaudi/">https://www.facebook.com/ludovicoeinaudi/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ludovico_einaudi">https://www.instagram.com/ludovico_einaudi</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ludovicoeinaudi.com">http://www.ludovicoeinaudi.com</a><br /><br />Music video by Ludovico Einaudi performing Live from The Steve Jobs Theater, California / 2019.
