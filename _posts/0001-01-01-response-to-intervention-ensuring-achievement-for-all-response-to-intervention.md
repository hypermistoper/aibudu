{% raw %}Response to Intervention (RTI) is a promising reform that leads to increased student achievement and overall school improvement. This video illustrates the implementation of RTI at the elementary school level as part of a model demonstration project. A description of the core components of the 3-tier RTI model is shared, including screening, core instruction, intensive interventions, progress monitoring, data review meetings, and fidelity of implementation. In addition, the perspectives of those involved in the collaborative initiative between the University of Minnesotaâ€™s Institute on Community Integration and Minneapolis Public Schools are shared.<br /><br />This video was funded in part by the Demonstrating Progress Monitoring for Early Identification, Accountability, and Success project (Grant No. #H326M050005) and the Research Institute on Progress Monitoring (Grant No. H324H030003) awarded to the Institute on Community Integration (UCEDD), College of Education and Human Development, at the University of Minnesota, by the Office of Special Education Programs, U.S. Department of Education.
