But they are unlikely to find much cooling off in Mayâ€™s report on consumer prices.<br />The consumer price index is expected to show a large 0.7% increase when the report is released Friday morning â€” more than double the gain in the prior month.<br /><br />And the number could be even higher after another spike in the cost of gasoline as well as steadily rising rents and food prices.<br />The increase inflation over the past year, meanwhile, is forecast to stay near a 40-year high of 8.4%.<br /><br />In April, the yearly rate fell for the first time in eight months to 8.3%. The prior 8.5% reading in March was the biggest since December of 1981.<br />The big worry on Wall Street DJIA, -1.94% SPX, -2.38% is that inflation is shifting to services from goods. Thatâ€™s because rising prices in services â€” think rent, hotel rates and plane tickets â€” tend to be harder to reverse and are often a sign inflation is becoming embedded in the economy.<br /><br /><br />This video was created to help people learn more about trading stocks and or Investing in the stock market.<br />I suggest stocks weekly to day traders and investors to consider.<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I am not a financial advisor.
