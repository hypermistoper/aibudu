{% raw %}&quot;A video which leaves space for your own imagination!&quot; (DJ Koze Quote)<br /><br />PAMPA031 - DJ Koze „Pick Up“ is available at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pamparecords.com//products/pampa031-pick-up/">https://pamparecords.com//products/pampa031-pick-up/</a><br />and here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pampa.lnk.to/DJKoze">https://pampa.lnk.to/DJKoze</a><br /><br />Animation: Terlina Lie<br />Thanks to Papa Zoran Bihać<br />-----------<br />DJ Koze might be one of the world's best producers, but above all he's a DJ, and it's his DJ ear that governs. Just as in a great set, so with his releases: “Seeing Aliens” came out of nowhere, a big buzzing beast of a track, to announce that Koze was back on the scene and prime everyone for the coming album, knock knock. But now that Koze has your attention, it's time to remind everyone what's most important about club music, pull things back, take a turn to the left, and get deep into the groove.<br /><br />Thus “Pick Up”: the second single from knock knock is 100% pure groove, doubly so in the extended 12” version. In a sense it's incredibly familiar – it is essentially a filter disco record, very close to something you could imagine coming out of Paris around the turn of the millennium. But of course, this is Koze. Nothing is normal or familiar in his world, and he's taken this most foundational of clubland staples into new territory. Flipping samples of Gladys Knight &amp; the Pips “Neither One Of Us (Wants to Be the First to Say Goodbye)” and Melba Moore’s “Pick Me Up, I’ll Dance“, it creates something completely airborne, shot through with emotions such as gods must feel: not quite explicable to the human mind but strong enough to knock you off your feet. In its way it's absolutely as powerful as “Seeing Aliens”, but it comes in like the proverbial iron fist in a glove of velvet.<br /><br />Music taken from the Album &quot;knock knock“ - Release date: May 4th, 2018<br />(C) Pampa Records 2018{% endraw %}
