{% raw %}Monovision is a great solution for people over age 45 years that are experiencing age related focus dysfunction (presbyopia).  It can give a full range of vision from near to far away without the need for reading glasses or bifocals.  In this episode of A State of Sight, Isaac Porter, MD explains monovision in detail, including a quick demonstration of how to determine which eye is your dominant eye.<br /><br />As everyone ages, the lens inside of the eye progressively loses its ability to focus at near range (less than arms-length).  Usually around age 45, this ability decreases to the point that most people have difficulty reading at a comfortable distance.  This is the onset of presbyopia or age related focus dysfunction.  When this occurs, a bifocal lens with additional power in the lower lens must be used for near tasks.  People who use contact lenses or do not need glasses for distance vision may choose to use reading glasses to see up close.<br /><br />Monovision is a great alternative to bifocals and reading glasses since it conveniently provides a full range of vision for most situations.  In monovision, the dominant eye is corrected fully for distance, and the non-dominant eye is corrected mildly nearsighted to give near vision.  In reality, both eyes see at distance and both eyes see at near, but the dominant eye favors distance and the non-dominant eye favors near vision.<br /><br />Monovision can be accomplished with contact lenses, lens implants placed inside the eye, and LASIK, PRK, or other forms of laser vision correction.  Although many people think that monovision sounds intolerable due to the difference between the eyes, actually 80% of people adapt to monovision and are successful with it.  For the 20% of people that do not adjust to monovision, alternatives are available in multifocal contact lenses, multifocal lens implants, and returning to bifocals or reading glasses.<br /><br />Please post any questions or comments that you may have about monovision or the alternatives!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://lowryeye.com">http://lowryeye.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/eyeporter">http://facebook.com/eyeporter</a><br />twitter @eyeporter{% endraw %}
