{% raw %}Welcome to the FPL Mate Fantasy Premier League gameweek 34 wildcard draft team selection video for the 2021/22 Premier League season!<br /><br />In this video I will show how I would line up with my wildcard if I were to play it in gameweek 34, with the intention of a shakeup to bring in Chelsea players, double gameweek players and covering bench boost and triple captain chips ready for the upcoming gameweeks. I will go through each player individually and tell you why this is a great team for FPL GW34, GW35, GW36 and beyond. Hopefully you will enjoy my advice and tips surrounding each player.<br /><br />If you like what you see, subscribe and become my latest mate!<br /><br />🐦 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/FPLMate">https://www.twitter.com/FPLMate</a><br />📸 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/FPLMate">https://www.instagram.com/FPLMate</a><br />👾 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/rfVSeftbmx">https://discord.gg/rfVSeftbmx</a><br />🏆 Join: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCweDAlFm2LnVcOqaFU4_AGA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCweDAlFm2LnVcOqaFU4_AGA/join</a><br />️⚽️ FPL Mate league link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fantasy.premierleague.com/leagues/auto-join/b8usac">https://fantasy.premierleague.com/leagues/auto-join/b8usac</a><br />️⚽️ FPL Mate league code: b8usac<br />👕 FPL Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fplmate.myspreadshop.co.uk/">https://fplmate.myspreadshop.co.uk/</a><br /><br />#FPL #FantasyPremierLeague #PremierLeague{% endraw %}
