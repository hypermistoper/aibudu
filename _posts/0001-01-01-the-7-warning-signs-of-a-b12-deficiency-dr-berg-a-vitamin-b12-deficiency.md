Vitamin B12 is an important vitamin involved in making DNA, myelin sheath, and red blood cells. <br /><br />It’s important to know how to identify vitamin B12 deficiency symptoms because if you are deficient in vitamin B12, you could experience irreversible damage to your nervous system. <br /><br />When you’re looking for a vitamin B12 supplement, there are two kinds, a natural version, and a synthetic version. Always take the natural version, which is called methylcobalamin. But, it’s really best to get vitamin B12 from the diet. <br /><br />The main cause of a vitamin B12 deficiency is not a lack of vitamin B12 in the diet. It has to do with malabsorption—the person can’t absorb vitamin B12. <br /><br />Conditions that can block the absorption of B12:<br /> • Atrophy of the stomach <br /> • Hydrochloric acid deficiency <br /> • Gastritis <br /> • Ulcers<br /> • Celiac<br /> • Chrohn’s disease <br /> • Irritable bowel syndrome <br /><br />Foods rich in vitamin B12:<br /> • Animal liver and kidneys<br /> • Clams (and other seafood)<br /> • Sardines <br /> • Beef <br /> • Chicken <br /> • Fish <br /> • Fermented products (kimchi, sauerkraut, and fermented dairy)<br /> • Insects <br /> • Nutritional yeast (non-fortified) <br /><br />7 warning signs of a vitamin B12 deficiency:<br />1. Pale skin <br />2. Constant fatigue <br />3. Mouth problems <br />4. Cognitive issues <br />5. Nerve damage (peripheral neuropathy) <br />6. Blurred vision <br />7. Fast pulse rate <br /><br />Follow Me On Social Media:<br />Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/FB-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/FB-DrBerg</a><br />Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/IG-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/IG-DrBerg</a><br />Anchor:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Anchor-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/Anchor-DrBerg</a><br />TikTok:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/TikTok-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/TikTok-DrBerg</a><br /><br />ADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description">https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description</a><br /><br />FREE COURSE➜ ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse">http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse</a><br /><br />Talk to a Dr. Berg Keto Consultant today and get the help you need on your journey.
