{% raw %}The expression that something is ‚Äúa hard pill to swallow‚Äù isn‚Äôt just a metaphor. Swallowing pills can be difficult and downright unpleasant. It causes one in three people to gag, vomit, or choke. That may keep people from sticking to their medication routines, which can make them sicker.<br /><br />Kindly share this video on your social media so we can educate others worldwide.
