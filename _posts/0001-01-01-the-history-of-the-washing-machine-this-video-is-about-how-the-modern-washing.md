{% raw %}This video is about how the modern washing machine appeared. First was the scrub board, invented in 1797. American James King patented the first washing machine to use a drum in 1851. In 1858, Hamilton Smith patented the first rotary washing machine. Less than 20 years later, in 1874, William Blackstone built the first washing machine designed for convenient use in the home. <br /><br />The first completely electric-powered washing machine was named &quot;The Thor&quot;, invented by Alva J. Fisher, and introduced in 1908 by the Hurley Machine Company of Chicago, Illinois. Bendix Corporation introduced the first domestic automatic washing machine in 1937, having applied for a patent in the same year. In 1978, the first microchip-controlled automatic washing machines were produced. <br /><br />------------------------------------------<br />Voice &amp; editing: Nicolae Bondar (myself) <br /><br />Music: Hydra, by Huma-Huma, downloaded from YouTube Audio Library<br /><br />Information Sources: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washing_machine">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washing_machine</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washboard_(laundry)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washboard_(laundry)</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_washing_machine">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thor_washing_machine</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://speedqueeninvestor.com/history-of-the-washing-machine">https://speedqueeninvestor.com/history-of-the-washing-machine</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gizmohighway.com/history/washer.htm">https://www.gizmohighway.com/history/washer.htm</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fisherpaykel.com/nz/company/innovation/smartdrive-technology.html">https://www.fisherpaykel.com/nz/company/innovation/smartdrive-technology.html</a> <br /><br />We can stay in touch on Facebook: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/HistoryClassPage/">https://www.facebook.com/HistoryClassPage/</a> <br /><br />You can support our channel here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/historyclass1">https://www.patreon.com/historyclass1</a> <br /><br />For every video I try to use copyright free images.
