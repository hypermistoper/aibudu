{% raw %}We have super stretchy soft slime and the Paw Patrol the Movie pups are here to help us build some giant bugs! We get to unbox a Drizzl soft as cotton molding toy! It feels so weird! It looks like kinetic sand, molds like Play Doh but feels like cotton! The bugs we create are super cute and we had so much fun sharing this unique crafting toy with you! I hope you enjoy this cool video for kids and thanks for watching!<br /><br />#GrowingLittleOnes #PawPatrol #Drizzl #Toys #Slime #KineticSand #PlayDoh #PawPatrolTheMovie<br /><br /><br /><br />Growing Little Ones for Jesus is a Christian Toy Channel with family friendly videos perfect for kids! We love letting children enjoy their favorite toys while learning to GLO for Jesus! <br /><br /> <br /><br />THANKS TO WORDOLOGY for the plan of salvation video presentation!
