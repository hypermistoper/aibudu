He is interested in probing the structure of matter and the nature of its interactions at the very smallest scales, to understand the fundamental nature of our universe. Whiteson is part of the ATLAS collaboration which built, maintains, and collects data from the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, where the Higgs boson was discovered. <br /><br />In 2014, along with his team, he developed Cosmic Rays Found in Smartphones (CRAYFIS), a smartphone app which uses a cell phone‚Äôs camera to detect ultra high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). These particles are nearly a billion times as energetic as the particles in the Large Hadron Collider, and their origin is a mystery.<br /><br />Youtube Membership: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz3qvETKooktNgCvvheuQDw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz3qvETKooktNgCvvheuQDw/join</a><br />Podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://anchor.fm/john-michael-godier/subscribe">https://anchor.fm/john-michael-godier/subscribe</a> <br />Apple: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/3CS7rjT">https://apple.co/3CS7rjT</a><br /><br />More JMG <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnMichaelGodier">https://www.youtube.com/c/JohnMichaelGodier</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/EventHorizonShow">https://www.patreon.com/EventHorizonShow</a><br /><br />Follow us at other places!<br />@JMGEventHorizon<br /><br />Music:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://stellardrone.bandcamp.com/">https://stellardrone.bandcamp.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://migueljohnson.bandcamp.com/">https://migueljohnson.bandcamp.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://leerosevere.bandcamp.com/">https://leerosevere.bandcamp.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aeriumambient.bandcamp.com/">https://aeriumambient.bandcamp.com/</a><br /><br />FOOTAGE:<br />NASA<br />ESA/Hubble<br />ESO - M.Kornmesser<br />ESO - L.Calcada<br />ESO - Jose Francisco Salgado (josefrancisco.org)<br />NAOJ<br />University of Warwick<br />Goddard Visualization Studio<br />Langley Research Center<br />Pixabay<br />#particlephysics{% endraw %}
