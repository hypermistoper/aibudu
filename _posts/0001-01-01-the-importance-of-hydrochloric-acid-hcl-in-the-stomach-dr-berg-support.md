He also explained what is hydrochloric acid and how to build hydrochloric acid inside our stomach. <br /><br />HCL is the most important fluid inside our body and without this acid in the stomach, our body will have a lot of problems. <br /><br />The stomach acid needs to be very strong (acidic) preferably in the range of 1-3. If the stomach is less acidic it will not release pepsin (which is an enzyme for chemical reactions and is responsible for the breakdown of proteins). <br /><br />3 Major Health Benefits of Hydrochloric Acid <br />1. To help breakdown proteins<br />2. Absorb minerals <br />3. Kill microbes<br /><br />Junk food, stress, antiacids, diarrhea, and vomiting can cause low stomach acid. And as we age, we lose our stomach acids, in fact, by age 70, we have only 25% of our stomach acids left.<br /><br />Low Stomach Acids Can Trigger:<br /> ‚Ä¢ Gas<br /> ‚Ä¢ Indigestion<br /> ‚Ä¢ Bloating<br /> ‚Ä¢ Iron deficiency (anemia)<br /> ‚Ä¢ Soft tissue calcium build-up<br /> ‚Ä¢ Low B12<br /> ‚Ä¢ Constipation<br /> ‚Ä¢ Red cheeks<br /> ‚Ä¢ SIBO (small intestine bacterial overgrowth)<br /> ‚Ä¢ Leaky Gut<br /><br />FREE COURSE‚ûú ‚ûú <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse">http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse</a><br /><br />Talk to a Product Advisor to find the best product for you!<br />Call 1-540-299-1556 with your questions about Dr. Berg's products.
