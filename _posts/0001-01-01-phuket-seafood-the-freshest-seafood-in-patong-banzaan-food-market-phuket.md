{% raw %}Patong Phuket Thailand: The Freshest Seafood in Patong. NEW THAILAND FOOD AND TRAVEL VIDEOS EVERY WEDNESDAY! Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/darrenb3">https://www.youtube.com/user/darrenb3</a> <br />Eating Scallops, Shrimp and Crab at Banzaan Food Market Market in Phuket Thailand. Delicious Thai Seafood in Patong Phuket Thailand.<br /><br />This was a meal my family and I had at Banzan Fresh Food Market in Patong in Phuket Thailand. Banzaan Market is open every day from 7am till 9pm and its Google Maps coordinates are: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/jF87Zs6ZTPD2">https://goo.gl/maps/jF87Zs6ZTPD2</a><br /><br />The market is not far from Junceylon Shopping Mall and the Thai food there is delicious! At this market you can buy the seafood from downstairs and take the food upstairs for the vendors at the Thai restaurants there to cook. The vendors charge different prices per kilogram to cook the food purchased at the market. The meal we had in the video cost 800 baht for cooking and 1,250 baht for the seafood from the market. The restaurant area is clean and comfortable and the staff seem very friendly. And the food we had was delicious!<br /><br />Check out my recent video: Thai Street Food Guide: 5 Street Food You Should Eat in Thailand 2018 here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPAJdaOAx4E&amp;list=PLNLfDOIkGB10SjFG4uGZxcu2LDUKPEwNX&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EPAJdaOAx4E&amp;list=PLNLfDOIkGB10SjFG4uGZxcu2LDUKPEwNX&amp;index=2&amp;t=0s</a><br /><br />If you love seafood, Thai food, or food markets in general and you're in Patong Phuket Thailand, I’d definitely recommend visiting Banzaan Market!
