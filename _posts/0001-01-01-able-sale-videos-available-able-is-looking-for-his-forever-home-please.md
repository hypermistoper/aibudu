{% raw %}Able is looking for his forever home! Please see his advertisement on my facebook page, Camille's Mustangs, for more information: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/594176610998776/posts/1623362974746796/?d=n">https://www.facebook.com/594176610998776/posts/1623362974746796/?d=n</a><br /><br /><br />Howdy! My name is Camille and I have a passion for gentling wild mustangs. Wild horses and burros are overpopulated in the western United States, so to keep population numbers from rising, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) periodically gathers wild mustang and offers them for adoption to eligible homes. I train mustangs to make them suitable for domestic lives and to show the world how amazing these underdogs can be.
