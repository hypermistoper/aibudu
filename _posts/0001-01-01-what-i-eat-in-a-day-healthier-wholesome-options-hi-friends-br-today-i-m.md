{% raw %}Hi Friends,<br /> Today I'm sharing what a typical day of eating looks like at our house! I'm all for balanced eating and substituting with healthier options. I think food should be fun ( and nutritious ðŸ˜‰). I hope this video inspires you and gives you some recipe ideas! Enjoy!              With love,<br />                                                                            Steph<br /><br />Instagram.com/this.golden.hour<br />Email: littleblueberrykisses@gmail.com   <br />DM or email to collab!<br /><br />Music: Epidemic Sound<br /><br />Sourdough Waffles:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.girlversusdough.com/sourdough-waffles/#tasty-recipes-12908">https://www.girlversusdough.com/sourdough-waffles/#tasty-recipes-12908</a>{% endraw %}
