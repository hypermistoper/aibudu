{% raw %}It's the moment we've all been waiting for! We are MOVING IN! We have water, we have beds, we have power so nothing is holding us back and spend a first amazing week getting to know our new farm in Portugal. But, it's not all smooth sailing and it looks like the weeks ahead will be full of challenges. <br /><br />We’re renovating an abandoned farm in Northern Portugal, with a dream to turn it into a thriving off grid, sustainable home for our growing family. Join us as we embark on the adventure of a lifetime, sharing all the ups and downs and seeing where this path will lead us. One thing is for certain, we can’t wait for all of it!! <br /><br />Please make sure you SUBSCRIBE and join us for the adventure.<br /><br />INSTAGRAM @thenewbys<br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100072484423971">https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100072484423971</a><br />PATREON: www.patreon.com/thenewbys<br />Website: www.thenewbys.co.uk<br /><br />We'd really love to hear from you so leave us a comment, and if you are enjoying the journey with us and would like to see extra content, please hop over to Patreon we would be so very grateful for your support. <br /><br />THANK YOU!<br /><br />We are John, Tara, and Crusoe Newby.
