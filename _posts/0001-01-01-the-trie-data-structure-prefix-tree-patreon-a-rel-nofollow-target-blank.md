This video talks about the Trie data structure (also known as a prefix tree) and shows you how to implement it in C. <br /><br /> <br /><br /><br />[Affiliate Link]<br />I use Kite, a free AI coding assistant, that provides better code completions. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kite.com/get-kite/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_campaign=jacobsorber&amp;utm_content=description-only">https://www.kite.com/get-kite/?utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_campaign=jacobsorber&amp;utm_content=description-only</a><br /><br />Welcome! I post videos that help you learn to program and become a more confident software developer. I cover beginner-to-advanced systems topics ranging from network programming, threads, processes, operating systems, embedded systems and others. My goal is to help you get under-the-hood and better understand how computers work and how you can use them to become stronger students and more capable professional developers.<br /><br /><br />About me: I'm a computer scientist, electrical engineer, researcher, and teacher. I specialize in embedded systems, mobile computing, sensor networks, and the Internet of Things. I teach systems and networking courses at Clemson University, where I also lead the PERSIST research lab. <br /><br />More about me and what I do:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jacobsorber.com">https://www.jacobsorber.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~jsorber/">https://people.cs.clemson.edu/~jsorber/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://persist.cs.clemson.edu/">http://persist.cs.clemson.edu/</a><br /><br />To Support the Channel:<br />+ like, subscribe, spread the word<br />+ contribute via Patreon --- [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/jacobsorber]">https://www.patreon.com/jacobsorber]</a><br /><br />Source code is also available to Patreon supporters. --- [<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jsorber-youtube-source.herokuapp.com/]">https://jsorber-youtube-source.herokuapp.com/]</a>{% endraw %}
