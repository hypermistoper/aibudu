{% raw %}A careful review of the generic latisse, called careprost with active prostaglandin bimataprost. This ingredient often causes fat atrophy or fat loss in the eye region under and around where it is applied and can cause a sunken in and darkening look. Use with caution and if you experience this you may want to use natural options like castor oil or almond oil applying to the follicules of the lashline before bed instead of this bimatoprost. Comment below if you have had similar experiences!<br />Here is a link to others with this side effect: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.realself.com/review/buffalo-ny-latisse-careprost-my-eyes-sunken-hollow-periorbital-fat-atrophy">https://www.realself.com/review/buffalo-ny-latisse-careprost-my-eyes-sunken-hollow-periorbital-fat-atrophy</a>{% endraw %}
