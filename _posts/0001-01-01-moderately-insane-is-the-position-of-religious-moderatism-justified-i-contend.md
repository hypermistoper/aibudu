{% raw %}Is the position of Religious Moderatism justified? I contend that it is not. A religion is defined by certain criteria, and in the case of Christianity, that criteria is that one must believe in the Jesus story and seek His grace. The claim of Jesus being God is backed only by the Bible; if the Bible is true, then it would follow that Jesus is God. However, so-called &quot;moderates&quot; claim to not take the entire Bible literally, which would contradict the claim that it is infallible and divinely inspired. That having been established, there is no longer any reason to believe that Jesus is God because doubt is now cast onto a book once &quot;infallible.&quot; Going deeper, this poses a serious problem for the entire faith of the individual, who must now accept the entire Bible at face value or establish himself as a deist. This is the apex of my contention: religious moderatism is not a legitimate position. It is a copout for social liberalists to avoid being labeled as nuts. I can understand the motivation behind this, and so I address moderates here in order to challenge their asserted position. It is my theory that as pantheism is merely a sexed-up version of atheism, moderatism is merely a sexed-up version of deism.{% endraw %}
