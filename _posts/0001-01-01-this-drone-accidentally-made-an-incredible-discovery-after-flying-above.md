{% raw %}This drone accidentally made an incredible discovery after flying above this desert in Mexico. Today, we take a look at what this drone discovered in this desert.<br /><br />The world is ours to explore, from hidden archaeological structures to impressive astronomical feats.<br /><br />We are continuously finding innovative ways to explore new places and terrain. One of the more modern developments in archaeological research is being able to use drones to capture images and share the view of places we have not been able to reach before. Back in 2013, a team of archaeologists managed to use a drone to reveal a village that has been estimated to be about one thousand years old.<br /><br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />Thank you to CO.AG for the background music!{% endraw %}
