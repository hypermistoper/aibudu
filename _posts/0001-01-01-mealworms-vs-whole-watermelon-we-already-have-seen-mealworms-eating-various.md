{% raw %}We already have seen mealworms eating various things, like apples, oranges, cucumber, but I was curious if they could handle a whole watermelon. This wasn't an easy task, because you can't just fill up a bathtub with mealworms and drop a watermelon in it. That way the ones on the bottom would suffocate, and basically, only your top 1 inch (or so) layer would be live mealworms, the rest would be just laying on the bottom. So if I can make only a maximum 1-inch thick layer of mealworms can they possibly finish a whole watermelon, - I was wondering. Just like as with the McDonald's cup experiment, no one has ever tried to feed a whole watermelon to mealworms, so in order to find out the results, I needed to do it myself. I must say I wasn't too surprised. <br /><br />Next to the mealworms vs whole watermelon time-lapse, I also added some other clips you asked for in the comments, such as mealworms eating lemon, octopus, salmon, and coconut. You didn't ask for it, but since these worms enjoy live greenery, I fed them a pea plant too.<br /><br />I'm glad I can also show you the hatching process of these small creatures in macro. That part was very interesting to me. <br /><br />Another small update-slash-news, I'm forced to use watermarks on my time lapses from now on. I didn't want to, because in my opinion, it takes away from the experience, but I also have to protect my time lapses from people who take it without permission and act like it was theirs. <br />I considered the framing of every clip, so the watermark is not obstructive, I hope you will still enjoy my videos.<br /><br /><br /> ðŸ’¢ STAY IN TOUCH ðŸ’¢ <br />â–º www.youtube.com/photoowl<br />â–º www.instagram.com/photoowlsocial/<br />â–º www.twitter.com/Photoowlsocial<br /><br />ðŸŽµ Music:<br />1.<br />Opportunity Walks by Kevin MacLeod<br />Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4173-opportunity-walks">https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4173-opportunity-walks</a><br />License: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://filmmusic.io/standard-license">https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</a><br />2.<br />No Good Layabout by Kevin MacLeod<br />Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4140-no-good-layabout">https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4140-no-good-layabout</a><br />License: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://filmmusic.io/standard-license">https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</a><br />3.<br />Snowing and freezing by Borrtex (Artlist)<br />4.<br />Sicilia by Notize (Artlist)<br /><br />â˜• VIRTUAL COFFEE (one-time donation):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/photoowl">https://ko-fi.com/photoowl</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Interestingly, when the melon started to smell, the mealworms most of the mealworms tried to keep their distance from it.
