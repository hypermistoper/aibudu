{% raw %}This was the hardest part of Deliaâ€™s breast cancer journey, a double mastectomy (bilateral mastectomy). They remove all of the tissue in both breasts during this procedure. Chemotherapy had its own challenges with hair loss and various other side effects, but there was still the knowledge that her natural hair would eventually grow back and the side effects would subside over time that brought some comfort back. With this surgery, knowing that a large part of her womanhood was going to be permanently removed was a mental hurdle Delia had to overcome in the weeks leading up to the surgery. <br /><br />Post surgery recovery was quite a bit more challenging as well. They placed drains on either side of her with tubes protruding out of the abdomen with open incisions. These along with the large incisions and metal expanders placed in her chest wall caused a lot of pain and discomfort, and eventually, an infection so bad she needed to be rushed to emergency surgery. We will document this in upcoming videos.  <br /><br />Despite this ongoing trial, Delia continues to do her best, wearing that radiant smile that lights up a room.<br /><br />#breastcancerawareness<br />#breastcancersurvivor{% endraw %}
