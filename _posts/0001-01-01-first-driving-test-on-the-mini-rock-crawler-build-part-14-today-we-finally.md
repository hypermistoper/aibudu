{% raw %}Today we finally get to test drive this mini rock crawler build. We test out the flex of the suspension and the 4 wheel drive setup.  For this project I'm using the Fox 2.0 Air shocks. These are air only shocks and can be made hard or soft just by adding more nitrogen pressure. The fox air shocks are super easy to adjust and really light weight, perfect for these smaller projects but they can also work well in jeeps and other light rock crawlers. King air shocks are also a great option if your build is like mine, but I feel like the Fox airs have a better factory valving setup. The Fox air shocks should go together really well with the mini rock bouncer as that's really what they were designed for.  <br /><br /><br />check out go power sports for all your go kart needs <br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2sC3WLT">https://bit.ly/2sC3WLT</a><br /><br />ratherBwelding merchandise <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2PF21Vf">https://bit.ly/2PF21Vf</a><br /><br />Follow me on Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rather_bwelding/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/rather_bwelding/?hl=en</a><br /><br />help support me on Patreon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/ratherBwelding">https://www.patreon.com/ratherBwelding</a><br /><br /> #fabrication #rockcrawler{% endraw %}
