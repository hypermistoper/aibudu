Marianne is a living kidney donor to her best friend, and realising that life was for living and never really knowing what‚Äôs round the corner - we decided to fulfil our dream of travelling full time.<br /><br />So in March 2018 after the kids had left home, we sold our belongings, rented our house and moved into our campervan called Trudy.  We set off to see the world and after vanlifing around Ireland and Europe, we grabbed our backpacks and spent 5 months exploring Central America.  <br /><br />Feeling like we needed a challenge, we planned the ultimate van life adventure! In Jan 2020 set off to drive around the World from UK to UK.  But after arriving in Turkey, covid caught up with us and closed the borders, so we had a wonderful 18 months exploring this special country.  Realising we were not going to be able to head further East, we decided to do a handbrake turn and go the other way and shipped our van to the USA.<br /><br />We hope you enjoy coming with us, and we‚Äôll continue to share our real adventures and hope you feel inspire to step out of your comfort zone and try something new.{% endraw %}
