{% raw %}A quick whizz around my house to look at my five favourite gadgets. It was going to be “tech” but I wanted to include my wooden toaster tongs and I don’t think they quite pass as technology!<br /><br />AD info: contains paid content for Sky Glass. * denotes affiliate link. <br /><br />So, first household gadget that makes my life easier every single day: Sky Glass. I’ve been using Sky Glass since last year and can honestly say that there’s nothing I don’t like about it. I thought initially that I was just swayed by its looks: it’s sleek, it has everything built in so no need for extra boxes, dishes, soundbars and it comes in three sizes and five different colours! But it was what was on the inside that became my favourite thing - the amazing search feature and the playlist feature. Rather than searching through each app, one by one, because you can’t remember where such-and-such series is, you simply ask Sky. It finds it instantly. See demo in the video! You can find more info on Sky Glass here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sky.com/glass.">https://www.sky.com/glass.</a> I think it’s excellent. <br /><br />Second gadget: Nest. We’ve had a Nest thermostat for about seven years and it makes it really easy to take control of your heating. You can control it remotely, via the app, easily create a schedule so that the heating never comes on when you’re all at work or school and I love that it comes on when you go near to it, a bit like it’s alive. Just marvellous. Highly recommend; we’ve bought four over the years so that should be a fair indication of how good it is!<br /><br />Wooden toaster tongs. Need no explanation, they do what they do. But they do it so triumphantly that you wonder why toasters don’t just come with these already attached. Every toaster needs a pair. You can find them here*: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/37sEL6f">https://amzn.to/37sEL6f</a><br /><br />Dyson V11 Absolute Vacuum. Cor. This is my all-time favourite hoover and I’ve bought or tested most. It doesn’t come close to the Miele Animal one in terms of power, but the fact I’m not tethered by a cord more than makes up for that. Plus the Miele sucks up everything within a two mile radius which means I’m always retrieving lego pieces from it. I’m sure Dyson probably have a newer model that’s superseded this one, but I can tell you that this has great battery life (it does about 45 mins, which is plenty for me as I hoover often!) and works really well moving from carpet to wood floors or tiles. No need to change the head. Please don’t even ask me about that bloody Eufy robot vacuum which is the bane of my life. Had you asked me a year ago then it would have been in my top 5, now I want to burn it. You can find the V11 here*: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3LI8PJW">https://bit.ly/3LI8PJW</a> It’s vom-inducingly pricey but I’m hoping it’ll last for life. Chance would be a fine thing! <br /><br />Brizebox Extra-Large Parcel Box: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.brizebox.com/product/standalone-extra-large/">https://www.brizebox.com/product/standalone-extra-large/</a> This has genuinely changed my day in that I no longer need to sign for parcels when I’m trying to get work done. It felt constant before, even if it was only a couple of times a day. This means delivery drivers can just pop the parcel into the drawer and then it drops down and is locked inside. And this holds SO MANY PACKAGES. It’s huge. If I wasn’t claustrophobic I’d get in it to show you how big. Obviously pick a size relevant to how much post you get!<br />.<br />PS dress is Emannuelle Dress from Hush, £69 - I wear a 10 and I’d say it’s true to size but designed to be comfortable not tight*: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tidd.ly/3KzHp9f">https://tidd.ly/3KzHp9f</a>{% endraw %}
