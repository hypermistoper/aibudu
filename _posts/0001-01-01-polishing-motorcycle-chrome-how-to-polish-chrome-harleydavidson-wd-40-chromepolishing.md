This will be more common with standard bike or cruiser bikes rather than sportbikes, dirt bikes, and ATVs. There are a number of products on the market to polish chrome, but the simplest and cheapest method is WD-40 and fine grade steel wool. Give your motorcycle a good wash, and allow it to dry. Next, spray the steel wool with WD-40, or apply the spray directly to chrome areas. Use the steel wool to remove light rust stains. While you do this, you will automatically polish the chrome. But it is best to use a microfiber cloth for the final part of the job. Grant's Microfiber Cloths will buff and shine the chrome to really make this part of routine motorcycle maintenance not so routine in terms of appearance. <br /><br />So learn how to polish motorcycle chrome, and you will be blown away by the results! <br /><br />10 Amazing WD-40 Uses for Your Car, Truck and Automobile<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNdXNU_Grm4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNdXNU_Grm4</a><br /><br />Filmed: March 7, 2022<br /><br />Moonshine Town - JR Tundra{% endraw %}
