{% raw %}Stop wasting your time and money on buying holsters that ultimately won't work. Here is where you’ll find a HOST of resources to begin your deep dive into holster selection and concealment mechanics.  <br /><br />Don’t waste your money on another low quality holster. Take the time to do your research on the front end and avoid building out an embarrassing box of misfit holsters. <br /><br />CHAPTERS:<br />0:00 Intro<br />0:49 Research<br />1:42 Appendix carry<br />2:08 Holster requirements<br />2:46 SAFETY<br />3:28 Holster retention<br />5:23 Open holster mouth<br />6:19 What makes a quality holster<br />8:12 Holster length (Keel principle)<br />9:26 Built in wedge<br />10:10 Efficient design<br />10:36 BUDGET<br />11:49 Customization period<br />12:33 Customization features<br />13:54 It's not ALL about gear<br />14:31 MY BOX OF SHAME<br /><br />HOLSTER RECOMMENDATIONS &amp; RELATIONSHIP DISCLOSURES:<br />PHLster Holsters:<br />Jon and Sarah Hauptman of PHLster Holsters are leading the way in holster design and quality standards. Not only do I work for this company, as their Director of Customer Development, but I also use their products on a daily basis. My chosen concealed carry set up includes an Enigma Express equipped with a sport belt, and DIY paracord leg leash. Note that a lot of the resources I'll be sharing with you below will come from PHLster, but that is solely because they have the most robust and built out resources on the topic of concealment success. <br />You can find my Skeleton Holster review here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8wzt5OdjPU&amp;list=PLY9l-L0RpliUvscU74ejeNF9xC165Myek&amp;index=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8wzt5OdjPU&amp;list=PLY9l-L0RpliUvscU74ejeNF9xC165Myek&amp;index=1</a><br />Written Enigma Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.armedandstyled.net/resources/phlster-enigma">https://www.armedandstyled.net/resources/phlster-enigma</a><br /><br />Henry Holsters: <br />Henry Holsters is run by Andrew Henry, the inventor of the Modwing, and the king of comedy. Andrew is a wizard at design, efficiency, and manufacturing. In addition to designing and selling holsters, he also manufactures the Enigma Express, Floodlight, Pro, Summit, and Skeleton Holsters from PHLster. I would consider Andrew a friend. I have purchased all of my own Henry Holster products. <br />You can find my Flint Compact review here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pptc7RIB1ds&amp;list=PLY9l-L0RpliUvscU74ejeNF9xC165Myek&amp;index=2&amp;t=12s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pptc7RIB1ds&amp;list=PLY9l-L0RpliUvscU74ejeNF9xC165Myek&amp;index=2&amp;t=12s</a><br /><br />JM Custom Kydex:<br />I have no relationship with JM Custom Kydex. If you're looking for a quality holster for an unusual gun, they're the most likely to offer exactly what you're looking for. Make sure to check out their &quot;quick ship&quot; options before building out something custom as it will take longer to arrive. <br /><br />Dark Star Gear:<br />This company is owned by Tom Kelly. His Hitchhiker holster was the first quality concealment holster I ever owned, and it has served me very well with both my Glock 48, and my Glock 42. Although I don't have a relationship with Tom, I did receive my Hitchhikers for free as a gift from my friend John Johnston, who is sponsored by Dark Star Gear. <br />See my written review of the Hitchhiker: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.armedandstyled.net/resources/hitchhikerholster">https://www.armedandstyled.net/resources/hitchhikerholster</a><br />See my video review of the Hitchhiker: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K0pmFYWbSQ&amp;list=PLY9l-L0RpliUvscU74ejeNF9xC165Myek&amp;index=3">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-K0pmFYWbSQ&amp;list=PLY9l-L0RpliUvscU74ejeNF9xC165Myek&amp;index=3</a><br /><br />FOLLOW UP RESOURCES:<br />You can find my holster review playlist here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY9l-L0RpliUvscU74ejeNF9xC165Myek">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLY9l-L0RpliUvscU74ejeNF9xC165Myek</a><br /><br />What is a holster wing? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QpfmTDyLhc&amp;list=PLY9l-L0RpliV2cFH4-c64IADCgnyRoO-q&amp;index=2">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6QpfmTDyLhc&amp;list=PLY9l-L0RpliV2cFH4-c64IADCgnyRoO-q&amp;index=2</a><br /><br />What is a holster wedge? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTydL61jpRQ&amp;list=PLY9l-L0RpliV2cFH4-c64IADCgnyRoO-q&amp;index=1">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xTydL61jpRQ&amp;list=PLY9l-L0RpliV2cFH4-c64IADCgnyRoO-q&amp;index=1</a><br /><br />Concealment Mechanics: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.phlsterholsters.com/the-basics-of-concealment-mechanics/">https://www.phlsterholsters.com/the-basics-of-concealment-mechanics/</a><br /><br />Holster retention DEEP DIVE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.phlsterholsters.com/retention-should-kydex-holsters-click/">https://www.phlsterholsters.com/retention-should-kydex-holsters-click/</a><br /><br />Poke and check method: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGkIqsPAPA&amp;list=PLrjZ_jHF_Spku_RJvSU5l7kr8rE96OftL&amp;index=3&amp;t=51s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ajGkIqsPAPA&amp;list=PLrjZ_jHF_Spku_RJvSU5l7kr8rE96OftL&amp;index=3&amp;t=51s</a><br /><br />PHLsters Concealment Mechanics: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrjZ_jHF_Spku_RJvSU5l7kr8rE96OftL">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrjZ_jHF_Spku_RJvSU5l7kr8rE96OftL</a><br /><br />Big Tex Ordinance allows you to use code ARMEDANDSTYLED to receive 10% of certain supplies including, but not limited to the new Enigma Express, and the PHLster Skeleton. <br /><br />Big Tex Ordnance is a financial supporter of Armed and Styled!
