{% raw %}Grades k-2, using your five senses to make observations. While on a hike at the CREW (Corkscrew Regional Ecosystem Watershed) Marsh Trail, I stop in several different locations to describe what I can see, hear, smell, and touch. I don't do much tasting!<br />#FloridaScience #Science #ScienceTeacher{% endraw %}
