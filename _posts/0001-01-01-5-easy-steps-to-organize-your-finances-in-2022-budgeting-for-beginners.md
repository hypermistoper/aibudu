Sometimes budgeting and money management can seem really complicated, but there is an easier way for you to budget as a beginner. These 5 steps for beginner budgeting in 2022 are perfect if you're feeling overwhelmed with finances and need to know how to get your finances organized. <br /><br />Step 1: Evaluate Past Spending<br />Print out your bank statements from the last 3 months and go through them to highlight your spending by categories. This gives you a visual representation of where your money has been going. Then take out a calculate and add up how much you're spending in each category every month. Going back through multiple months to look at how you're spending your money can help you to average your spending and know how much to budget for variable expenses. <br /><br />Step 2: Document the Details of Your Finances<br />Along with your spending, you also need to know your average income, debt details, and your savings goals. Writing all of this info down in one place will help you to easily put together a budget later on in the next steps. <br /><br />Step 3: Set Financial Goals <br />There are 2 different goals I like to talk about: outcome goals and progress goals. Outcome goals, like SMART goals, focus on a certain, usually numerical, outcome (like paying off X amount of debt). Progress-based goals focus on building habits and acquiring new skills/knowledge. Progress goals are perfect for beginners or those really overwhelmed with their finances. <br /><br />Step 4: Find a Budgeting Method<br />The two methods I recommend most are zero-based budgets or automated budgets. I have talked about both on my channel. Zero-based budgeting is perfect for people with low income, high debt, or big financial goals. It gives you more control over your finances, but it much more hands on. Automated budgets are perfect for those who want to set-it-and-forget it. They are a great easy way to budget for beginners. <br /><br />Step 5: Monthly Check-Ins<br />After setting up your budget, it's important to continue to check in with your budget and finances to see how things are going. What is working, what isn't? Are you on track to reach your goals? Do you need to try out a new budgeting system? Monthly budget check-ins allow for you to stay on track, and keep your finances organized as your life and goals change.  <br />CHAPTERS:<br />0:00 intro<br />0:43 Step 1: Evaluate Past Spending<br />3:22 Step 2: Document Details<br />5:35: Step 3: Set Financial Goals<br />7:55 Step 4: Choose a Budget<br />10:17 Step 5: Monthly Check-Ins<br /><br />Business inquiries only: <br />theavocadotoastbudget@gmail.com<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Links included in this description might be affiliate links.
