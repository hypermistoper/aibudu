{% raw %}Today we are going flying to verify the fuel flow numbers from the last video. Does the UL Power really only burn 4.8 gallons per hour? Watch this video to find out.<br /><br />Just a note about the first scene (pulling the airplane out of the hangar) being out of focus. I had the camera still on manual focus so it wasn't focused properly, and I didn't feel like reshooting that scene LOL. Again, I'm sure by about my millionth video I'll figure this stuff out!<br /><br />#ULPower #ZentihCruzer #Engines #Flying{% endraw %}
