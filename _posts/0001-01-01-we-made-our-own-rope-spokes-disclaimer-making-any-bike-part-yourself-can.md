{% raw %}Disclaimer: Making any bike part yourself can be dangerous, wheel components especially. DON'T try this yourself! Adam's one of the smartest people I know and there's been a ton of work put into testing and prototyping before we got to this point. Even though we show our process this isn't a tutorial, if you do want some rope style spokes for yourself I encourage you to buy some Berd spokes instead.<br /><br />I've had a lot of requests to try Berd &quot;rope&quot; spokes since putting out my wheel build videos. I've certainly been interested but been put of by the costs. <br /><br />It turns out I've not been the only one interested... Adam from Tartybikes took his interest a little further though and decided to tackle the incredibly complex task of making his own rope spokes!<br /><br />It's hard to convey the work he's put into finding a strong, reliable and repeatable method of making these spokes! It's been in the hundreds of hours but the work has paid off and he has managed to make a functioning pair of rope spoke wheels which are holding strong after 400 miles of off road MTB in the grime of a UK winter.<br /><br />Adam shared his progress on forums which is where I first saw what he was up to but it was actually Adam who got in touch with me about building one of my wheels for my channel. I can't thank him enough for the work he's put in to make this video possible!<br /><br />It's a long video for sure but there's so much golden information I figured a lot of you would like to absorb as much as possible (the Patreon version has over 20 mins of extra content).<br /><br />I hope you enjoy the video, I found the process fascinating and I hope you do too!<br /><br />Let me know your thoughts and of course if you want to get yourself any trials (or MTB parts) give them a call or head to www.tartybikes.co.uk and get some orders placed, it's a great shop run by great people and I'd love it if I could get them some promotion and extra orders :)<br /><br />Patreon www.patreon.com/aliclarkson<br /><br />Instagram @aliclarkson<br /><br />Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aliclarkson.com/">https://aliclarkson.com/</a><br /><br />Paypal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/AliClarksonGB?locale.x=en_GB">https://paypal.me/AliClarksonGB?locale.x=en_GB</a>  <br /><br />Sponsors: Inspired Bicycles <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.inspiredbicycles.com/">https://www.inspiredbicycles.com/</a> Tartybikes tartybikes.com Sunlight Motorhomes <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sunlight.de/en/">https://www.sunlight.de/en/</a> Ride Concepts Shoes <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rideconcepts.com/">https://rideconcepts.com/</a> Light Bicycle Carbon Rims <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lightbicycle.com/">https://www.lightbicycle.com/</a> Chris King <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chrisking.com/">https://chrisking.com/</a> Industry Nine <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://industrynine.com/">https://industrynine.com/</a> ODI grips <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://odigrips.com/">https://odigrips.com/</a> Rimpacts Tyre Inserts <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rimpactmtb.com/">https://www.rimpactmtb.com/</a> MIX Hydration <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mxitup.com/">https://mxitup.com/</a> HKT frame protection and mudguard <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hktproducts.co.uk/collections/hkt-ali-clarkson-collab">https://www.hktproducts.co.uk/collections/hkt-ali-clarkson-collab</a><br /><br />#berdspokes #wheelbuild #aliclarkson #bike{% endraw %}
