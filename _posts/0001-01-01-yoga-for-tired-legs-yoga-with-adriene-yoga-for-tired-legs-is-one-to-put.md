{% raw %}Yoga For Tired Legs is one to put in your regular rotation! This practice is good for so many many circumstances. Great for post-hike, post-run, post-walk, or workout. Wonderful when you are feeling bleh, or after a long day on your feet. A fabulous way to transition from one thing to the next, taking a little 25 min TLC yoga practice for your mind body and soul. Therapeutic for lower back, for the feet, and for those feeling anxious or fatigued. <br /><br />Need I say more? Hop on your mat and connect to your breath. Why? Because you are worth it. ;-)<br /><br />Join the community!<br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - <br /><br />❤️SUBSCRIBE to the YWA channel for free yoga videos every week and to support high-quality free yoga for all! ❤️<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/yogawithadriene?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />- - - - - - - - - - <br /><br />🧘🏽♂️🧘♀️Become a FWFG YOGA member! 🧘🏻♂️🧘🏿♀️<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fwfg.com/?via=adriene">https://fwfg.com/?via=adriene</a><br />Join Find What Feels Good and access over 700 videos including yoga and meditation for all levels.
