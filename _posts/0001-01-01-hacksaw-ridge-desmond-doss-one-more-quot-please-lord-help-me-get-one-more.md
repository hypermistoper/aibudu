This something I've put off for a while but wanted to do as I feel more confident within myself. <br /><br />Thank you for the support on the Desmond videos. <br />This movie is my all time favourite war movie and I always love paying tribute. This also my personal fav performance from Andrew Garfield. <br /><br />Desmond Thomas Doss served as a combat medic with an infantry company in World War II. In the Battle of Okinawa Doss proved himself by saving 75 men, becoming the only conscientious objector to receive the Medal of Honour for his actions during the Second World War. He proved his commanding officers, sergeant and fellow comrades wrong.<br />Staying true to his beliefs. Doss Was a hero. <br /><br />Please like and Subscribe<br />#fanvidfeed #hacksawridge #desmonddoss #andrewgarfield #fanvid #hscksawridgetribute <br /><br />Music: <br />Steve Jablonsky - We Have to Go<br />Hsclsaw Ridge OST - Praying{% endraw %}
