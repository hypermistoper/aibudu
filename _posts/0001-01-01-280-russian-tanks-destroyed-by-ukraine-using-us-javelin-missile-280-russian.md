{% raw %}280 Russian Tanks Destroyed by Ukraine Using US Javelin Missile.<br /><br />The Ukrainian military fighting the much larger Russian invasion force has been able to Destroyed hundreds of Russian tanks and armoured vehicles using a hand-held anti-tank missile supplied by US, according to a US journalist who has been tracking the war in the east European nation.<br /><br />At least 280 Russian armoured vehicles have been destroyed with the American Javelin missile, out of 300 shots fired, journalist Jack Murphy said in an article quoting a US Special Operations official. The Javelin, made jointly by Raytheon Missiles and Defence, and Lockheed Martin, follow a flight path that hits targets from the top, where the armour is relatively weaker. <br /><br />Almost every tank armour is thicker on the sides, but the top is known to be weaker, and that is where the Javelin missile strikes. The Javelin can also be fired in a straight flight path mode, if needed<br /><br />Thanks For Watching<br />The Thumbnail/Videos are for illustrasion purpose only<br /><br />#usmilitary #ukrainenews #russianmilitary{% endraw %}
