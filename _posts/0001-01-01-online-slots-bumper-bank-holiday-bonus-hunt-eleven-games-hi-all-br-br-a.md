{% raw %}Hi All,<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gentlemangambler.com/promotions/the-gentlemans-exclusive-offers/">https://www.gentlemangambler.com/promotions/the-gentlemans-exclusive-offers/</a><br /><br />18+ begambleaware.org<br /><br />A small, if slightly disappointing profit on Saturday.  I really did think I was in a solid position to finish with a reasonable profit, but alas it was a succession of unspectacular results.  Still, I won't grumble with anything better than break even, plus I also made further progress towards the current wagering requirements of the bonus I am playing through.  Not long to go now on that.<br /><br />I have a huge 11 game list today, having once again picked up a lot of the bonuses very cheaply.  As a result, I am hopeful of a profit, and possibly even more so this time than last.  With a full 7 games landing for under £10 each, surely there is potential here!<br /><br />There were of course a few failures along the way, but nothing that hit too hard.  The total cost was a very, very reasonable £319 for these 11:<br /><br />Eternal Phoenix MW<br />Durian Dynamite<br />Buffalo Rising MW<br />Centurion MW<br />Misery Mining<br />Legion X<br />King of Cats (Lion)<br />Beast Mode<br />Hex<br />8 Tigers Gold<br />Razor Shark<br /><br />There are some decent games on this list, hence the optimism!  I hope  you enjoy this one.<br /><br />I will be including safer gambling information in all my videos from now on, alongside links back to my own website.  This is an important aspect of gambling, and I urge anyone affected to use all the available resources, no matter how big or small you feel the issue might be.  <br /><br />GamCare: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gamcare.org.uk/">https://www.gamcare.org.uk/</a><br />BeGambleAware: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.begambleaware.org/">https://www.begambleaware.org/</a><br />GAMSTOP - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gamstop.co.uk/">https://www.gamstop.co.uk/</a><br /><br />Please also remember that my videos are highlights of longer sessions.  A more complete picture is given with the statistics given and the profit / loss videos I post on my channel and website.  Put simply, playing these slots is a losing proposition over time, and is simply a means of paying for entertainment.<br /><br />#onlineslots #slots #bonushunt{% endraw %}
