{% raw %}Lincoln and Cadillac have had the super-sized luxury SUV market to themselves for decades, but now there’s a new option promising more of everything. More power, more LCD real estate, more features and more gadgets. The new Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer are part of Jeep’s plan to have an SUV for everyone, they would just like you to not call it a Jeep. Supposedly Wagoneer is a sub brand￼, but until there’s a separate dealer network it’ll remain a Jeep to me.<br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3qM33hHgedfi7qTKKgIApg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3qM33hHgedfi7qTKKgIApg/join</a><br />EV Buyers Guide: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/evbuyersguide">https://www.youtube.com/c/evbuyersguide</a><br />The Mountain Garden: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheMountainGarden">https://www.youtube.com/c/TheMountainGarden</a><br /><br />Buy Merch! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://aoamerch.com">http://aoamerch.com</a><br />Follow AoA on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fb.me/alexonautos/">http://fb.me/alexonautos/</a>{% endraw %}
