I know my schedule with posting has been so wild and sometimes ya'll will get 2 videos in a week then none for another 2 weeks so I'm trying to find a routine that allows me to post weekly on Fridays again! anyway I feel like its been forever since we spoke so how are we feeling?? it's the same old same old over here per usual. I have nothing much to say besides how silk sonic unironically CHEWED the Grammys up and SPIT it out and I'm living for it. Silk sonic is so amazing and makes me feel like im in a pool of warm water surrounded by nature. okay anyway this isn't a silk sonic fan page so I'll let y'all go enjoy the rest of your day! make sure to drink some water and tell your friends and family you love them!<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ouchailey/">https://www.instagram.com/ouchailey/</a><br />Business Inquiries: haileyelizabeth@weareverified.co <br />P.O. box: <br />Hailey Elizabeth<br />PO Box 8243<br />Romeoville, IL 60446<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />00:00 - INTRO<br />0:42 - RAYCON<br />2:29 - DELEN MILLARD<br />41:34 - OUTRO{% endraw %}
