{% raw %}Winner of the 2022 Player's Championship !!!<br />Cameron Smith makes his living on the PGA Tour around the greens — an impressive skill, considering how difficult that is nowadays.<br /><br />Smith’s true brilliance around the greens happens on the surface itself. The Australian ranked 10th in SG: Putting last year and is first this year, gaining a whopping 1.234 strokes per round so far this season.<br /><br />All of which is to say, it’s probably a good idea to take an especially close look at his putting.<br />Analyze his pre-shot routine... Take a look at Smith’s entire routine and notice, right before he hits the putt, how long he looks at the hole. It’s not a quick glance, like the rest of us are probably used to making. It’s a long, deliberate look.<br /><br />Most players will just glance at the hole... It’s a great example of how he uses his eyes to focus on the target and keeps them there for about 3 seconds.”<br /><br />Taking a longer look at the hole can accomplish two things: It can bring you a momentary sense of calm before you hit the putt, and more crucially, it can help sharpen your focus at your target.<br /><br />At least in theory. But if it’s good enough for one of the best putters on the planet, it’s at least worth a try for the rest of us.{% endraw %}
