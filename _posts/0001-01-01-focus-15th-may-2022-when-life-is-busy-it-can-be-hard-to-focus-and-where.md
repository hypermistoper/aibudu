{% raw %}When life is busy it can be hard to focus. And where should our focus be? Jesus got Peter to focus by asking him the same question three times in a row. And in the end it came down to love, because that's what enables us to grow and reach out and share.<br />This service is a reworking of one from a year ago. That's why Catriona's hair gets shorter and longer during the service!<br /><br />Readings are from John 21:15-25 and Psalm 23.<br /><br />invergowrieparishchurch.org/faith     CCLI license 609314<br />carsechurches.com     CCLI license 751341<br /><br />For contact details see website{% endraw %}
