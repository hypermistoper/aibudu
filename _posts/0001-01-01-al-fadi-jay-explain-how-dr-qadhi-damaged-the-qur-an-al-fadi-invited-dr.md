{% raw %}Al Fadi invited Dr Jay Smith to come on to his CIRA International YouTube channel on June 8, 2022 to help unpack and explain what happened two years earlier, on June 8, 2020, when Mohammed Hijab asked in a YouTube interview with Dr Yasir Qadhi (one of the leading authorities on the Qur'an in the English speaking world), to tell him which of the 30 official Qira'at Qur'ans was the one which was given to Muhammad in the 7th century?<br /><br />While much of the academic world knew of this problem, no one of any note from within Islam had ever admitted publicly that there were 30 different Qur'ans, nor that the differences were in the tens of thousands of variant letters and differing words.<br /><br />By admitting this problem in such a public forum, hundreds of Muslims have subsequently left Islam, and have blamed Dr Qadhi for their apostasy.<br /><br />This interview did so much damage to the integrity of the Qur'an, destroying any notion that the Qur'an has been perfectly preserved eternally, that we have decided every year to commemorate this day, June 8, as the &quot;Hole in the Standard Islamic Narrative&quot; day, and plan to remind the world of it each year as an annual celebration.<br /><br />So, enjoy this interview between Al Fadi and Dr Jay as they help explain exactly what happened that fateful day, two years ago<br /><br />Â© Pfander Centre for Apologetics - US, 2022<br />(65,500) Music: &quot;Quantum Technology&quot; by Musiclfiles, from filmmusic-io{% endraw %}
