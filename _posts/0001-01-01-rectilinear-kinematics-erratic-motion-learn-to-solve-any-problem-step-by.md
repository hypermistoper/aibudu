{% raw %}Let's look at how we can solve any problem we face in this Rectilinear Kinematics: Erratic Motion chapter. I will show you how to look at the graphs given, and how to find the equations by integrating, taking the derivative, and manipulating equations, and everything is explained step by step. <br /><br />V-T graph (snowmobile) question fully solved here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryVLj-zhvqI">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ryVLj-zhvqI</a><br /><br />A-T graph (missile) question fully solved here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NXlwFoYxTk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1NXlwFoYxTk</a><br /><br />V-S graph (gold cart) question fully solved here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJPFIm0d3to">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJPFIm0d3to</a><br /><br />V-S graph (boat) question fully solved here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWGbXxHY7GM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWGbXxHY7GM</a><br /><br />A-S graph (train) question fully solved here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1u4ed74X6k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1u4ed74X6k</a><br /><br />If you found these videos helpful and you really want to give something, it's very much appreciated.<br />Donate:<br />ðŸ”¹ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/questionsolutions">https://ko-fi.com/questionsolutions</a><br />ðŸ”¹ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.questionsolutions.com/donate">https://www.questionsolutions.com/donate</a><br />ðŸ”¹ PayPal: questionsolutions@questionsolutions.com<br /><br />Find more at www.questionsolutions.com<br /><br />Book used: R.
