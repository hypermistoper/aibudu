What kind of properties must synthetic data have for it to be useful? <br /><br />This presentation will answer these questions and will show you how you can use MlFinLab to generate synthetic correlation matrices and time series. The data generation techniques include vines (R, C, D, Partial Correlation), Extended Onion Method, Hierarchical Correlation Block Model (HCBM), bootstrapping (row, pair, block), clustered time series, and CorrGAN.{% endraw %}
