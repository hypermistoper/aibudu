{% raw %}Why is a rapist Roman Krok, convicted in Derby,  UK for the attempted rape of a 14 year old girl be allowed to walk into Ireland?<br />Why should he get a free social house, welfare, tax funded legal aid after being charged with burglary?<br /><br />All immigration to Ireland should be controlled and vetted.

Roman Krok has recently been charged with the crime of burglary....why are Irish workers being forced to pay for his Free legal aid? <br /><br />How is it safe for our kids that a convicted attempted rapist of a 14 year old girl is allowed to live  approx 200 yards from the primary school in Dunleer? <br /><br />These are all questions I have for Helen McEntee and the Government ministers. Rapist Roman Krok is another of #helensfelons A Slovak Roma...what does Roman Krok contribute to Ireland? Why is he here? Why has he not be deported yet?{% endraw %}
