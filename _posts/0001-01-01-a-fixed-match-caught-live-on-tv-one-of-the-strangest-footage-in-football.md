{% raw %}One of the strangest footage in football. In the Egyptian league Mohammed Awad ,Ismaili goalkeeper, saves the ball clearly with his hand out of the box without any kind of objection from players, or coaching stuff of the Nasr Mining Team or any kind of foul announced by the refree. The Game ended 1 -1 and was 1 -1 before that ball save.{% endraw %}
