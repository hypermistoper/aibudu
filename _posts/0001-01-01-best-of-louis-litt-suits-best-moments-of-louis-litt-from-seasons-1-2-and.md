{% raw %}Best moments of Louis Litt from seasons 1, 2, and 3 of Suits. <br />Suits is a USA Network TV drama that features Rick Hoffman playing Louis Litt - an expert in corporate finance at the Pearson-Hardman Law Firm. Though considered a very dedicated partner, Louis exhibits many comedic traits such as extreme paranoia, jealously, and vindictiveness. In my opinion, Louis makes the show. <br /><br />Canadian Viewers watch at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vimeo.com/85748437">https://vimeo.com/85748437</a>{% endraw %}
