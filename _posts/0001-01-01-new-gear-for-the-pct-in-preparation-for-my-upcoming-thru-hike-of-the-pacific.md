{% raw %}In preparation for my upcoming thru hike of the Pacific Crest Trail I have been getting some new gear! After 11,000 miles of hiking other long distance trails I definitely have a lot of what I need already, but there is always room to improve, and room to look at my past experiences to ask what I can do better this time. So these are some changes I am making for the PCT in 2022!<br /><br />Gear mentioned:<br />Wind Pants - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Lvq3eh">https://amzn.to/3Lvq3eh</a><br />Trowel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3sISA7U">https://amzn.to/3sISA7U</a><br />Nitecore NB10000 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3LnXnUy">https://amzn.to/3LnXnUy</a><br />Nitecord Charger - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/34V4lQ3">https://amzn.to/34V4lQ3</a><br />Camera - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3rM5seb">https://amzn.to/3rM5seb</a><br />Ravpower 20000 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ravpower.com/products/rp-pb201-pd-60w-20000mah-portable-charger">https://www.ravpower.com/products/rp-pb201-pd-60w-20000mah-portable-charger</a><br />Ravpower Charger - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ravpower.com/products/rp-pc144-pd-30w-dual-port-usb-c-charger">https://www.ravpower.com/products/rp-pc144-pd-30w-dual-port-usb-c-charger</a><br />Backpack - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.Palantepacks.com">https://www.Palantepacks.com</a><br /><br />When it comes to the PCT I had hiked 1,000 miles of it in 2018, as well as a large section hike of Norcal and Oregon in 2017, so I am mostly aware of what I will need or want for this hike to be comfortable and happy.<br /><br />I have been using the same Montbell Tachyon wind pants for 7 years! They are ripped beyond belief and I am so tired of sewing them. They cost 100 dollars so I am very hesitant to buy new ones when I know how easily they will rip and tear. So this year I will be carrying some budget friendly 'dance pants' instead! They are made of ripstop, and serve the exact same purpose as my old pants, but 80 dollars cheaper! They keep wind off my legs, they trap heat in, they are great for walking in without overheating, they pack down small, and they are very lightweight! The one downside is they are slightly heavier. 1.9oz compared to 3.9oz. As an extra alternative to these, I recommend checking out the enlightened equipment copperfield wind pants. Cheaper than montbell, but just as light.<br /><br />For this hike I am also bringing a trowel! I haven't used one before on any other of my thru hikes but there is a couple things I have learned. The first being that in the desert and most of the west coast, the ground is very hard and compact. A trowel will make all my hole digging needs so much easier. Also with trails like the PCT or AT, anything I can do to inspire others to make less of an impact is very important. So many people hike these trails year after year that they are being loved to death. I will be carrying the Deuce of Spades, I show the medium sized one in this video but will get the smaller one for my thru hike.<br /><br />I have also upgraded my battery bank! This Ravpower Pioneer PD battery is 20,000mah and charges at 30w. BUT I would recommend the Nitecore nb10000 for most people as it is better in literally every other way. Ravpower just charges faster, but charging speed isn't that important as you will be stopping in towns, staying in towns, hanging out at restaurants, and generally most people don't want to get in and out as quickly as I know I like to.<br /><br />I LOVE my current camera, a Panasonic Lumix G7, but I am going to switch it up for this hike! The Panasonic shoots GREAT video, but it is large, heavy, does not charge via usb, and is more of a professional camera rather than a camera you would take in the wilderness for a few months. So I have gotten myself a Sony ZV1 which is so much smaller, so much lighter, charges via usb, has great image stabilization, comes with an external mic, and all around seems much more friendly to a thru hike.<br /><br />In the off season I have been trying some new shoes! The Xero Mesa Trail's and so far they have been incredibly comfortable! Honestly they are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn. So I will continue to test and try them! Last year I wore the Merrell Trail Glove 6, and though I enjoyed them they were a little tight on my feet in a way simply sizing up wasn't fixing. They lasted a long time and were durable. They served me well, but they weren't perfect. High hopes for the Xeros!<br /><br />The last item I have upgraded is my backpack. Given my past experience on the PCT I have decided that I would like a larger backpack this time, so I am going with the 37L Palantepacks v2 in the white ultraweave fabric. This pack will allow me to go further between resupplies carrying more food, I can carry more water, it has a minimal hipbelt to help with those heavier loads, and all around I think will be great for this hike, as well as any future hikes I may need this extra capacity for!<br /><br />Hiking Essentials Shirt! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://jupiterhikes.com/product/hiking-essentials/">http://jupiterhikes.com/product/hiking-essentials/</a><br /><br />THE BACKPACKING GEAR I USE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.jupiterhikes.com/gear/">http://www.jupiterhikes.com/gear/</a><br /><br />If you would like to get access to content I create about this type of stuff I don't share anywhere else join me on my Patreon!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/jupiterhikes">https://www.patreon.com/jupiterhikes</a><br /><br />If you'd like more info about me, my hiking, or painting:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jupiterhikes.com">https://www.jupiterhikes.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jupiterhikes">https://www.instagram.com/jupiterhikes</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/jupiterhikes">https://www.facebook.com/jupiterhikes</a><br /><br />Some of the above links are affiliate links, at no cost to you using these helps to support this channel and these videos.
