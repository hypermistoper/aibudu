{% raw %}DO THIS WORKOUT TO SWEAT, DROP INCHES, &amp; FEEL GOOD!<br /><br />Todays workout is accompanied by a very special guest - my sister!<br />We are going to rock it out, jam it out, and sweat it out together. <br /><br />This workout left us sore for days, so I hope you are prepared for the challenge. <br /><br />Make sure to have a bottle of water near by - there will be a water break half way through this workout, but make sure to also hydrate as much as possible post workout and throughout the day. This workout makes you SWEAT, so be warned!<br /><br />We start todays workout with a 10 minute warm up, then we go into Tabata Style training for about 20 minutes total. There will be a nice cool down at the end of the workout as a reward for your hard work and to prepare you for your next workout!<br /><br />If you struggle at any point, its okay- just walk it out. Keep your head up, and if the full 40 minutes is too much, come back to it another day!<br /><br />Workout Stats:<br />Apple Watch Setting: High Intensity Interval Training<br />Calories Burned: 450*<br />Level of Intensity: 9/10<br />Level of Fun: 10/10<br /><br />*calorie expenditure may vary from person to person - do not be alarmed or discouraged if your calorie burn value is different from mine*<br /><br />If you get the chance, try this workout with a partner! Maybe a sister or mom or brother or hubby. If you've read this caption all the way through, make sure to leave a comment telling me if you will be doing this workout with a partner(and if so, tell me who), or solo!<br /><br />I cant wait to see you having fun with this one!<br /><br />___________________________________________________<br /><br />RESULTS<br /><br />SHARE YOUR WORKOUT VIDEOS on Tik Tok, YouTube or Instagram for a chance to be featured in my next video or on our community Youtube: @growwithjo unified<br /><br />Record a video or take a picture of you doing the workout, tag me @growwithjo #growwithjo @growwithjo_unified<br /><br />To get the BEST (AND QUICKER) RESULTS, follow a nutrition plan that supports your goals.
