{% raw %}Full Documentary of possibly, our favourite completed route through the heart of Algonquin Provincial Park. This is the complete story of our &quot;Half Nipissing Loop&quot; series.  <br /><br />We really wanted to make the original series into a single, documentary-style film, and to include some of the footage that we hadn't  used in the series. This Algonquin park canoe trip takes us right through the heart of Algonquin, to the Nipissing River.<br /><br />If you watched the original series, you will remember we encountered some difficulties along the way. With countless portages, that all seemed to be uphill, it was a trip to remember! Seeing some amazing wildlife, including moose, herons, loons and turtles all added to this canoe trip.  <br /><br />We decided to call this film &quot;Lost at Last&quot;, which describes how we felt, returning to the backcountry for the first time after pandemic restrictions were lifted in Ontario, allowing us to camp. Finally! We were able to let loose in the great outdoors again! <br /><br />We sincerely hope you enjoy the story in this documentary style format.  As always, we would love to hear your thoughts in the comment section below!<br /><br /><br />Some kind people have reached out recently to ask how they can support us.
