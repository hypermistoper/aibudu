Eye Catching Coral is a wholesale coral company located in Ohio.  They only sell to businesses and not the general public, but if you own a fish store that sells corals we highly recommend checking them out.  Even if your just a hobbyist head over to eyecatchingcoral.com anyway.  You can still browse through their collection and look at their amazing corals.  We have used Eye Catching Coral in the past, and we have never been disappointed.  They raise very healthy corals and display a great attention to detail when it comes to propagation and selling corals.  Their shiping methods are outstanding and most of the corals were fully extended upon their arrival.  Eye catching coral has one of the best customer service departments in the business and will help whenever given the chance.  Check out their Youtube channel at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2vfFFyci-hqLy9FkLkZPOw.">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC2vfFFyci-hqLy9FkLkZPOw.</a>  In the video you can see the process we use at C&amp;M Aquatics to unpack and get the corals ready for our aquariums.  We will never sell corals right away.  They first have to go through a stringent quarantine and inspection process and show signs of growth and health before going up for sale on the stores site.  We never sell wild caught corals either.  All of our corals are guaranteed to be at least second generation aquacultured corals.  It is in our experience that these corals do much better in home aquariums than their wild caught counterparts.
