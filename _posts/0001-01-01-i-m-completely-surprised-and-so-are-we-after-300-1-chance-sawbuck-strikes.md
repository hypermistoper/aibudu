{% raw %}Sawbuck earned a small slice of racing history when becoming the joint longest-priced winner ever in Irish or British horse racing as he scored at 300/1 at Punchestown.<br /><br />Beaten a combined 185 lengths on his seven career starts to date, it was no surprise to see him prove unpopular in the betting markets and return at the ceiling price of 999/1 on the Betfair Exchange.<br /><br />However, the son of Zoffany travelled smoothly throughout the race and once he bested Poker Night coming off the home turn still going well, it became apparent a huge shock was on the cards.<br /><br />Speaking to Racing TV, winning jockey Charlie O‚ÄôDwyer said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm completely surprised by him. He‚Äôs been in great form at home but if he'd just ran a nice race today I‚Äôd be very happy with him. He‚Äôs tanked and travelled everywhere and he‚Äôs done his best at the line.‚Äù<br /><br />While the victory was hard to see coming on the formbook, there was some potential on pedigree with Sawbuck hailing from a strong Ballymacoll Stud family, her dam New Morning having taken the Brigadier Gerard Stakes in 2005 and bred four previous winners for Godolphin.<br /><br />Prior to this win, Luke Comer‚Äôs He Knows No Fear held the record as the longest-priced winner in Ireland, having also won at 300-1 at Leopardstown in August 2020, but Sawbuck now shares that honour.<br /><br />#HorseRacing #Horses #Surprise #SportingShocks<br /><br />This is the official YouTube channel of Racing TV.<br /> <br />Racing TV is the UK's leading horse racing channel showing live racing from the best racecourses in Great Britain and Ireland.<br /> <br />Subscribe to Racing TV's free YouTube channel and get closer to the sport we all love.
