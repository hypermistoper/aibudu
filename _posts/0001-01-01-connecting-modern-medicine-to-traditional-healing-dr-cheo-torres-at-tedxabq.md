{% raw %}Since he was a boy growing up on the border of Texas and Mexico, Dr. Torres has been fascinated by the folk traditions of Mexico and of his Mexican-American roots. Both of his parents were versed in aspects of herbal lore and healing, and as he matured, they taught him to love and respect the history and folk knowledge of the ancient art of curanderismo, or traditional healing. Currently a VP of Student Affairs at the University of New Mexico, he's never forgotten his love for the traditions of his childhood, and students come from around the world to take his summer class on those healing arts.<br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
