{% raw %}In this episode, Perseverance chokes on a rock sample, takes some stunning images and creates the shape of a face on a Martian rock. <br /><br />MARSPAPER LIVE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=software.bitbybit.marspaperlive">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=software.bitbybit.marspaperlive</a><br /><br />Although some incredible things happened in the last 3 months, there wasn't as much to cover in this episode. Once the rover has retreated back to the landing site and starts the journey to the ancient river delta, the team at NASA should make more stops along the way, and inevitably more discoveries. Thanks for watching the series, it's such a pleasure to make! <br /><br />Help us reach 1 Million Subscribers:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZvxw99l3xDC6BIHb8nJKGg?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZvxw99l3xDC6BIHb8nJKGg?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Facebook<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/elderfoxdocs">https://www.facebook.com/elderfoxdocs</a><br /> <br />Mars Playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsaDLkF8wiRsL1Kke7FlYOS04xHGdyV9t">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsaDLkF8wiRsL1Kke7FlYOS04xHGdyV9t</a><br /><br />Space Playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsaDLkF8wiRuBEpvNFmnBpZUjY6lj86Nt">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsaDLkF8wiRuBEpvNFmnBpZUjY6lj86Nt</a><br /><br />Twitter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Elderfoxdocume1">https://twitter.com/Elderfoxdocume1</a><br /><br />Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech/MSSS/Cornell Univ./Arizona State Univ./SSI<br />Music: Epidemic Sound<br /><br />Please note: We are not affiliated with NASA in any way, we just want more people to be inspired by their great work!{% endraw %}
