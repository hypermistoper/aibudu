{% raw %}Find out how to prevent tonsil stones with these three simple remedies!<br /><br />DATA:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31370119/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31370119/</a> <br /><br />0:00 Introduction: Preventing tonsil stones <br />0:15 What are tonsil stones? <br />2:55 How to prevent tonsil stones <br /><br />In this video, we’re going to talk about how to prevent tonsil stones. Your tonsils are in the back of the throat, and they help prevent pathogens from going deeper inside of the body. <br /><br />Tonsil stones are basically biofilms. These biofilms are like little igloos for bacteria. Bacteria use these igloos to prevent themselves from being destroyed by antibiotics. <br /><br />The bacteria produce a gas that causes a bad odor. This is why bad breath is a common symptom of tonsil stones. Other symptoms of tonsil stones might be a metallic taste in the mouth and a cough. <br /><br />The stones typically develop after chronic tonsillitis or chronic antibiotic use. Factors like steroids, diabetes, sugar consumption, zinc deficiency, or vitamin D deficiency can increase the risk of tonsil stones. A high-carb diet and dairy products can also contribute to this issue. <br /><br />Natural remedies to prevent tonsil stones:<br />1. Garlic <br />2. Oregano oil <br />3. Grapefruit seed extract <br /><br />ADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description">https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description</a><br /><br />FREE COURSE➜ ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse">http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse</a><br /><br />Talk to a Dr. Berg Keto Consultant today and get the help you need on your journey.
