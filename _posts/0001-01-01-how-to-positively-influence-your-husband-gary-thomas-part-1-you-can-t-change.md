{% raw %}You can’t change your husband, but you can influence him. In this two-day Focus on the Family broadcast, Jim Daly and John Fuller talk with Gary Thomas over his book, Loving him Well. You can find his book here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2xU8waD">http://bit.ly/2xU8waD</a><br /><br />They discuss the challenges that come when you’re married to a man who seems unwilling to change. They discuss the importance of understanding who you are in Christ, how to act in a way where positive change in your spouse is possible, how to ask the “magic question” (“What things would you like me to do that I’m not doing?”), how to deal with “functional fixedness, and how understanding the differences between the male and female brain leads to greater intimacy.{% endraw %}
