{% raw %}The 1944 Kearny &amp; Trecker horizontal milling machine is not working how I'd like. What do I do with it? I need to replace it. I received a Shizuoka milling machine with both horizontal and vertical head attachments! I cut using both at the same time. How do these milling machines compare to one another?<br /><br />fireballtool.com<br /><br />How did I move this machine?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhKk-mfMlAM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhKk-mfMlAM</a><br /><br />Why do I have a giant red milling machine?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTCal8LjYTk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTCal8LjYTk</a><br /><br />What is an end mill?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi_ksADDF4E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qi_ksADDF4E</a>{% endraw %}
