{% raw %}It’s not just Democrats who are for this &quot;Ministry of Truth,&quot; it’s also influential Republicans. One said, “This is an important function of the DHS. But they put the absolute wrong person in charge of it.” Rubbish. The problem is the board’s existence, not who’s in charge of it.{% endraw %}
