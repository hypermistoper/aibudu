{% raw %}You do not have to pretend in order to seem more like someone else. <br />You do not have to lie to hide the parts of you that are not like what you see in anyone else. <br />You are unique, appreciate that uniqueness. <br />You are meant to be different. Nowhere, in all of history, will the same things be going on in anyoneâ€™s mind, soul and spirit as are going on in yours right now.<br />To be yourself, live your life for you!{% endraw %}
