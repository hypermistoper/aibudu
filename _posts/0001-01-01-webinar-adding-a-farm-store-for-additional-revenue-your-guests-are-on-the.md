{% raw %}Your guests are on the farm. They are having a good time. They love the soap in the bathroom and they have raked their fingers through the bags of wool in the barn. Wouldn't it be great if they could actually take something home from the farm to use, to display, to remember the great time they had? Of course there is the entire category of logo'd clothing too: t-shirts, sweatshirts, and hats. Free marketing on the hoof, so to speak.<br /><br />Join us as Valeria Pitoni of Stillwaters Farm in TN walks us through the set up of her farm store by converting an old silo into a gift shop. She filled it with many of her own products - soaps, candles, body lotions, and more. It's also the place where guests check in and out for her farm stay. What did it take for setup; what are the challenges; what are the benefits?<br /><br />Then we will hear from Jodi Benoit of White Oak Pastures in GA on the advent of her family's much larger farm store, with shelves of products from the farm and the surrounding area. Again - benefits and challenges - and tips for success.{% endraw %}
