Hopefully summarizing the last week or so of Quest 2 related news is useful to long standing Quest users. If you're a Quest 2 beginner maybe check out my other videos for tips &amp; tricks, life hacks &amp; Quest 2 news. <br /><br />Outro Song: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41O9PO6Zw0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B41O9PO6Zw0</a><br /><br />My channel is about VR Content (obviously lol) I've covered many topics on this channel in the past such as PC Building, PC Gaming Knowledge, Gaming News. That can be CPM rates, Industry knowledge, Business knowledge, how to edit, how to build a gaming PC, budget or not. But VR is cooler so I'm probably gonna keep doing that. <br /><br />I'm like the monkey you send into space for tests. I just come back with the results and give them to you for FREE.<br /><br />#GetHip #VirtualReality{% endraw %}
