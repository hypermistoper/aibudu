However, what if somebody asks you directions to a place? What if your phone's battery dies and you are lost? You get the idea! It's helpful to learn how to ask for and give directions in English! <br /><br />In this lesson, you will first learn the different types of streets, including avenues, boulevards, roads, lanes and ways etc. <br />Then, we'll talk about prepositions of place to say where a building is located. <br />After that, you will learn how to ask for directions (direct and indirect questions) and then how to give directions. <br />Finally, I'll show you a map and you will have to give me directions in the comments! Hope you enjoy the lesson! <br /><br />Want to receive free lesson summary PDFs? Click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pocenglish.com">https://pocenglish.com</a>{% endraw %}
