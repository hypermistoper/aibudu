{% raw %}Cyclone Fili has peaked and is now weakening - but itâ€™s likely to reform into a new storm system as it passes near - or even over - the North Island next week.<br /><br />At this stage Tuesday to Thursday sees severe weather risks in the North Island - and possibly even the upper South Island.<br /><br />Elsewhere, we have some wet weather next week for drought hit Southland and more showers in NSW where flooding again hit Sydney yesterday - but hopefully the worst is easing as we head into the weekend.{% endraw %}
