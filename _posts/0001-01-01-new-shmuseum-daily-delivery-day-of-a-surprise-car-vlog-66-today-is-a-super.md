{% raw %}Today is a super exciting day as we take delivery of a new Shmuseum team car, but before that, we've got some organising and tidying up to do in the garage.<br /><br />First things first, let's move some of the wheels, car parts and other random bits into the storage room. Although that means moving some of the model car and LEGO boxes out, and up to the 'Shmezz' where they will eventually be kept.<br /><br />A little while later, the mystery new car arrives... a MINI Cooper S Electric Shadow Edition. We cannot wait to start putting the little hatchback through it's paces as it becomes the perfect runaround for the team.<br /><br />First outing with the Shmini is to John Lewis to purchase a new laptop for Brad to edit on, he's spent the last 9 months using his own which is now 6+ years old! The weapon of choice is the latest MacBook Pro 14&quot; which so far is tackling everything that's being thrown it's way (including this video).<br /><br />Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
