{% raw %}Even though many of us are sticker-shocked at the new 2023 Toyota Sequoia pricing, David Chao explains how perception can change quickly if you compare the Sequoia to the also all-new Lexus LX 600.  The two share many major components and the Sequoia does 95% of what the Lexus LX does - at a much lower price point.  So if you think of the new Sequoia as a bargain-priced alternative to the Lexus LX, the entire scenario seems much more attractive.  In fact, the Toyota Tundra, which is a truck and not a SUV, is even cheaper than the Sequoia and offers very similar or nearly identical features, tech, and driving character.
