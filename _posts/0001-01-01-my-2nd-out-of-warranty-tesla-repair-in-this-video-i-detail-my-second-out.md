{% raw %}In this video I detail my second out-of-warranty Tesla repair on my 2015 Model S 85D. The first repair I already covered in a previous video, that was a broken glove box hinge:<br /><br />This time the intermediate steering shaft failed. Specifically the universal joint in that shaft seized up.<br /><br />The Tesla part number for my repair shown here is 1030622-00-A. The current price for the part is $280 and installation is $166.25. Those are Canadian dollar numbers. With tax I paid $504.26 total for this repair.{% endraw %}
