{% raw %}This is so important it could save you one quarter of your life, in fact it could even SAVE your life. The little annoying things we experience everyday could be symptoms of a larger problem, and if not addressed, could lead to regretful life changing situations. Organize! Do not put it off. Get rid of everything you don't need, simplify everything and learn to put everything in the exact same place. Emergencies are unexpected, and when they happen, you need to be able to act fast without thinking or looking around. Organization is key to success in business, relationships, health, everything.
