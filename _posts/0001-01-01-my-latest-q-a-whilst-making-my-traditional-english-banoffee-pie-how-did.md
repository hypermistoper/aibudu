{% raw %}In this episode I am going to be answering your questions whilst making a favourite dessert of mine - Banoffee Pie<br /><br />Banoffee Pie Recipe<br /><br />For the base:<br />225g / 2 cups digestive biscuits<br />150g / 2/3 cup butter - melted<br /><br />For the caramel filling:<br />397g can condensed milk or caramel sauce from a jar<br />200g / 3/4 cup Butter &amp; 200g / 1 cup brown sugar (if using condensed milk and not caramel sauce from a jar)<br /><br />For the topping:<br />3 small bananas , sliced<br />300ml double cream<br />1 tbsp icing sugar (optional)<br />1 square dark chocolate (optional)<br /><br />Directions<br />Crush the digestive biscuits, either by hand using a wooden spoon, or in a food processor, until you get fine crumbs, tip into a bowl. Mix the crushed biscuits with the melted butter until fully combined. Tip the mixture into a 23cm loose bottomed fluted tart tin and cover the tin, including the sides, with the biscuit in an even layer. Push down with the back of a spoon to smooth the surface and chill for 1 hr, or overnight. <br /><br /> I used condensed milk with butter and sugar to make my caramel. You could also use store-bought caramel if you wish. If you are using condensed milk, combine the butter with the brown sugar into a pan and heat until the sugar has dissolved. Add in the condensed milk and bring to the boil. Let it thicken for about two minutes and then it should be ready to pour over your biscuit base. <br /><br />Whip the cream until smooth and billowy. You can also fold in 1 tbsp of icing sugar to give a sweeter and more delicious addition to your cream (I would highly recommend doing this)<br /><br />Arrange the banana on top of the caramel, and then cover with the whipped cream. Sprinkle the shredded chocolate over the top to finish. <br /><br />More places to find me:<br /><br />My Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nicolasfairford.com/">https://www.nicolasfairford.com/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/nicolasfairford/">https://www.instagram.com/nicolasfairford/</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/nicolasfairford/">https://www.pinterest.co.uk/nicolasfairford/</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@nicolasfairford">https://www.tiktok.com/@nicolasfairford</a>{% endraw %}
