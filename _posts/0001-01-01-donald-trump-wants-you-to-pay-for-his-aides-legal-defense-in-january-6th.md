{% raw %}Donald Trump is still refusing to pay for the legal bills for the members of his staff that are facing subpoenas from the January 6th Committee - he won't even use his PAC money to support their legal fees. So instead, he's working with his old pal Matt Schlapp to use Schlapp's legal defense fund to raise money for the people who are in trouble for helping him. In other words, he wants you to donate money to protect his aides so they can protect him. Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins explains what's happening. <br /><br />Link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/24/politics/trump-january-6-legal-defense-fund/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/24/politics/trump-january-6-legal-defense-fund/index.html</a><br /><br />Become a member today!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join</a><br /><br />Support us by becoming a monthly patron on Patreon, and help keep progressive media alive!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire">https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire</a><br /><br />Find our merchandise at Teespring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store">https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store</a><br /><br />Spread the word!

See Donald Trump in spite of the fact that he is still sitting on a massive war chest, which he is raising through his political action committees, and in spite of the fact of being according to him, worth 10 billion dollars, he doesn't wanna pay any of the bills for all of his former people who are now in a lot of legal trouble for, you know, working for him during the Capitol riot. So what's happened now, as I said, he wants you to pay it, but he doesn't want you to send these people a check. No, here's what you have to do. Donald Trump has been in communications with Matt Schlapp, his good friend. Schlapp of course runs the first amendment fund, which is a legal defense fund that has been used already to pay the legal fees of several former Trump administration officials who are facing subpoenas from the January 6th committee.<br /><br />And according to Schlapp, he's having these phone calls with Donald Trump. They're working out the so-called criteria on who gets legal aid and who does not, and that's how he wants you to fund it, because you can of course give money to this first amendment fund and that money will then after careful deliberations go to people who worked for Donald Trump who have mounting legal bills because of the select committee. But that's just the surface story, right? Donald Trump doesn't wanna pay. He would rather you go donate and you pay yourself. But there's a reason Donald Trump doesn't want to pay, other than he doesn't like to spend money on things that he gets no benefit from. He is attempting to avoid any potential conflict of interest in directly paying for these individuals legal fees. Because of course, if they're about to go in front of the committee and Donald Trump says, oh, by the way, before you go in there and talk to these folks, I just want you to know I've covered all your legal bills.<br /><br />So you got nothing to worry about, you know, nudge, nudge, wink, wink type situation. He has to avoid that because that absolutely could be viewed, you know, depending on the lawyer who wanted to prosecute it, as witness tampering, as bribery. So he can't do that. But he also wants to make sure as does Matt Schlapp, I'm sure, even though he said the opposite, want to make sure that nobody who is cooperating with the committee, views it as legitimate, is getting any money. That's why he and Schlapp of course, are having these conversations. Again, according to Schlapp, that, you know, we're, we're determining the criteria. What makes somebody worthy of getting money from my first amendment fund? And again, Schlapp totally insists that cooperation with the committee does not matter. We are not taking that into consideration. No, we're just looking at who's most in need of it. You know, because not everybody's rich. So we've gotta take care of those people who just don't have the means to do it themselves.<br /><br />See, this is where the committee needs to step in and be like, hey, you know what? Don't worry about it. Because we're gonna keep your legal fees down as low as possible because we're gonna offer you some deals. Start wheeling and dealing folks because if you don't, I promise you, these individuals likely will.{% endraw %}
