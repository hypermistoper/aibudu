{% raw %}The Great Dane X Mastiff puppies got their vaccinations today. Plus little Miss Violet had her very first appointment to begin the journey to finding out what is going on. Bloods first and then we have somewhere to start with what scans etc and what we are looking for.<br /><br />She cannot see very much, it is suspected that she can only see light and shadows.<br /><br />We want to know as much as we can about little Violet so that we can help her as much as we can. Will let you all know in a few days when we know more with results.<br /><br />A very big thank you to GreenCross Vets at Tuggerah who very kindly extend their professional care at a discounted rate for rescues. Not all vets do this, and at $120 per puppy for just the consultation alone, that multiplied by all the puppies coming through a rescue is such a lot of money for them. Rescues really need the generosity of a vet like this one that makes it more affordable for charities. Whilst we’re not a charity, we just wanted to point this out as it would seriously make such a big difference to a rescue, like $1000s a year. The rescue we are working with has at least 150 puppies come through their care. It’s worth us supporting the vets that do. Thank you again.{% endraw %}
