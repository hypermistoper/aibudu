{% raw %}@As a matter of fact today we decided to look at Top 7 most dangerous army generals in East Africa. These officers are battled hardened having traversed the world in military manoeuvres either for education or actual combat.<br />They are considered dangerous in different ways, some are on the list because of their expeditions and others are on because they have done things that others can't.<br />In military stats, there are 2 countries that always stand out especially in the East and Central Africa, that is Uganda and Rwanda. However today, there are a few other countries in the mix.
