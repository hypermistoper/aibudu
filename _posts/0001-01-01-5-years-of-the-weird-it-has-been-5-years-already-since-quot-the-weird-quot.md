{% raw %}It has been 5 years already since &quot;THE WEIRD&quot; joined forces. Of course this had to be celebrated with a couple of big Murals. Mural Harbor invited the crew to Linz (Austria) to paint as much as they felt like. VIDAM, HRVB, ROOKIE and FRAU ISA painted their Version of &quot;the four seasons&quot; while LOOK, CONE, DXTR AND NYCHOS were working on their own weird concepts. Every Member had his own Mural done within 2 weeks followed by a Group Show at RABBIT EYE MOVEMENT ARTSPACE in Vienna. All in all it was a great fifth Birthday. A MAD THANK YOU to MONTANA CANS and MURAL HARBOR for celebrating with us. It was a blast!!<br /><br />Film by Christian Fischer<br />youtube.com/user/christian1fischer<br />vimeo.com/lowinio<br /><br />Music:<br />Mr. Airplane Man - Sun Sinking Low{% endraw %}
