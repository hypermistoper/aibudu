{% raw %}In my life I've always known Maserati existed, that they made some seriously cool cars, but also that they weren't cars many people were really brave enough to own. They drink like fish, depreciate like crazy and break all the time.<br /><br />Having now owned one, I figured it would be a good time to look back on my ownership experience and ask how the car met the &quot;expectations&quot; of exotic Italian cars.<br /><br />#Maserati #Quattroporte #Review<br /><br />Want to see your car on the channel?
