{% raw %}Mohs surgery is a procedure used to remove skin cancers (most commonly basal and squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma) in a way that preserves a maximum amount of healthy tissue. It is useful for skin cancers when:<br /><br />(1) the location of the cancer is near sensitive areas, like the fingers or face;<br />(2) earlier treatments have not worked;<br />(3) a skin cancer is large; and<br />(4) regular surgery is less likely to remove the cancer.<br /><br />This procedure video illustrates the procedure on 2 patients with basal cell carcinoma.
