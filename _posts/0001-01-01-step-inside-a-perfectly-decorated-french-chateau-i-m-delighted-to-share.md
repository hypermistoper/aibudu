{% raw %}I'm delighted to share this jewel box of a home with you. Sarah and George welcome us into the early 19th century Chateau de Brives, which they've turned into the perfect 21st century family home. Cutting edge for its time (with a floating spiral staircase and en suite bathrooms for every bedroom!) the chateau had fallen into a dilapidated state when Sarah and George bought it, but they've spent the last 11 years completely renovating it with style, flair and vision...<br /><br />To find out more about Sarah and George's life at their chateau, follow them on Instagram at @chateaudebrives or check out their website www.chateaudebrives.com<br /><br />Escape to the chateau with ‚ÄôThe Chateau Diaries‚Äô üè∞<br />In 'Sundays at the Chateau' Stephanie shares French chateau life and culture with you ‚ù§Ô∏è<br /><br />A very special thank you to all of you who have become Patrons of the Chateau de Lalande.
