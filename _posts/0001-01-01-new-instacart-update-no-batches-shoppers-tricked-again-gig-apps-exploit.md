{% raw %}#instacartshoppers #instacartbatches #Gigeconomy<br />INSTACART DID IT AGAIN! A new Shopper App update gone wrong, leaving veteran shoppers OUT of luck! This NEW update is another joke, but no surprise coming from a company with NO moral integrity. Watch today's rant- and I'm not holding back.<br /><br />Also- The Gig Workers Collective is a reputable organization who advocates for gig workers- yet- they meet opposition and negative, ignorant comments from other YouTubers and gig workers. &quot;If you don't stand for something, you stand for nothing.&quot; I am confronting this opposition, head on.<br /><br />Email me! jenonthego2@gmail.com<br />Instagram- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jenonthego2/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/jenonthego2/?hl=en</a><br /><br />A GREAT alternative to Gig Apps!<br />SIGN UP WITH INSTAWORK USING THIS LINK!! :  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instawork.app.link/jen-on-the-go">https://instawork.app.link/jen-on-the-go</a> <br />When you use this link AND work one shift- you will get an extra $50.00 IN ADDITION to your hourly rate.
