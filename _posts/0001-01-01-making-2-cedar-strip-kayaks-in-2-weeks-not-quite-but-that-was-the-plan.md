{% raw %}I've wanted to build a cedar strip kayak for over ten years and I say every year &quot;I'll do it this year&quot;. When I mentioned it to Corin he was super keen so we started to plan it. We only had 2 weeks which stretched a couple of days over that and I milled the timber before hand. Even though I think we did very well and had a great time. We didn't manage to finish mine but I'm keen to get to it soon and I still need to work out whether to finish the deck with kumiko or not. I'm really unsure how to make it into another video without covering what we've already shown but I'll have a think about it and see what I can work out.<br /><br />If you interested in building a kayak yourself then check out Nicks channel which shows how to build a kayak in far more detail than what we've shown in this video <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NickSchade">https://www.youtube.com/c/NickSchade</a><br /><br />And here's the link to the plans we used <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://guillemot-kayaks.com/catalog/strip-built/sea-kayak-recreational-kayak-solo/petrel-play">https://guillemot-kayaks.com/catalog/strip-built/sea-kayak-recreational-kayak-solo/petrel-play</a><br /><br />Check out Corin's Instagram here and feel free to contact him <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/corin_at_gameco/">https://www.instagram.com/corin_at_gameco/</a><br /><br />A big thanks to Darcy at Mooloo Timbers for his help.
