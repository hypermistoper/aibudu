{% raw %}Here's a look at WebComponent creation using all the latest shiny toys that are available today - some that are still experimental, but all that make creating a web component an absolute joy!<br /><br />We use CSS Shadow Parts, CSS Container Queries, Snowpack, Typescript and LitElement to create a futuristic Card Component. One day this will be useable across all browsers, but for now it's pretty limited<br /><br />Don't try to use this in production today!{% endraw %}
