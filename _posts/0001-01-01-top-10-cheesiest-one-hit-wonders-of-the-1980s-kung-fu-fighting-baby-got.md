{% raw %}“Kung Fu Fighting.” “Baby Got Back.” “Disco Duck.” What do these  very-different songs have in common? They are All monster one hit wonders, and also among the cheesiest songs of all time. It seems almost a prerequisite that if you write a one hit wonder, it should be at least a tad cheesy. And despite their cheesy 80s flare… it doesn’t mean we love them any less. It almost makes them more endearing, and most take us right back to a time when they ruled the airwaves., and things were simple… well, 1980’s Simple. ’m Nostalgic Nick for Doyouremember and today we’re queuing up some of the meltiest, most constipation-inducing songs from the “me” decade of the eighties!
