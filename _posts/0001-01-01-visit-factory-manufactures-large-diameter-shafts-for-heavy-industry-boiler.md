{% raw %}In this video we will visit a factory that manufactures large diameter shafts for heavy industry. <br />Here we will see firsthand the steps in the shaft manufacturing process from design to mold making, block casting and CNC machining. <br />0:33. The mold is put into an underground pit ready to pour molten steel into.<br />0:54. Steel is heated at a high temperature until it is melted, then it is put into a container and transferred to a casting mold.<br />2:17. The model simulates the process of molten steel being poured into the casting mold and filling the mold<br />3:11. After the steel condenses and cools, the semi-finished products will be hoisted out of the casting pit<br />3:24. And transferred to the CNC machining center where large lathes will perform the machining work to smooth the surface of the shaft.<br />7:39. Boiler manufacturing process{% endraw %}
