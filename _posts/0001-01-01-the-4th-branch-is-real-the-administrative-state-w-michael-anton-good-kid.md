{% raw %}Good Kid Productions sits down with Trump admin alum, &quot;Flight 93&quot; essayist, and Claremont senior fellow Michael Anton to discuss the SEO-maximized, viral-ready topic of the &quot;administrative state.&quot;<br /><br />Basically, there are four branches of federal government, but your history teacher only taught you about three of them. Not nice. <br /><br />That 4th branch has the power to keep us at war, overrule presidents, and micro-manage the lives of everyday Americas. It has wide and mostly unchallenged power to interpret laws however it wants (again, not nice). <br /><br />00:58 - What is the 4th branch (aka the administrative state)<br />2:53 - Does Congress even like power?<br />6:03 - The 4th branch: neurotic morons or existential threat to the republic?<br />8:46 - Could Trump have fought harder?<br />9:44 - Covid: a case study in the regime in action<br />11:37 - The Cult of the Presidency (what it is and why it's bad)<br />14:18 - The 4th branch is more powerful than any president{% endraw %}
