{% raw %}In the past 24-hour period, the Taal Volcano Network did not detect any volcanic earthquake but low-level background tremor has persisted since 20 April 2022. Activity at the Main Crater was dominated by the generation of plumes 900 meters tall that drifted southwest. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) emission averaged 6,391 tonnes/day on 22 April 2022. Temperature highs of 63.7°C were last measured from the Main Crater Lake on 25 February 2022. Based on ground deformation parameters from electronic tilt, continuous GPS, and InSAR monitoring, Taal Volcano Island and the Taal region has begun deflating in October 2021.<br /><br />Alert Level 2 (Decreased Unrest) prevails over Taal Volcano. DOST-PHIVOLCS reminds the public that at Alert Level 2, sudden steam-driven or phreatic explosions, volcanic earthquakes, ashfall, and lethal accumulations or bursts of volcanic gas can occur and threaten areas within TVI and along its coast. Entry into TVI, Taal’s Permanent Danger Zone, must therefore be strictly prohibited. Local government units are advised to continually strengthen preparedness, contingency, and communication measures, especially for previously evacuated high-risk barangays in case of renewed unrest. Civil aviation authorities must advise pilots to avoid flying close to the volcano as airborne ash and ballistic fragments from sudden explosions and wind-remobilized ash may pose hazards to aircraft. DOST-PHIVOLCS is closely monitoring Taal Volcano’s activity and any new significant development will be immediately communicated to all stakeholders.<br /><br />#taal #taalvolcano #taalvolcanoupdate<br /><br />Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AutobotTransformer/">https://www.facebook.com/AutobotTransformer/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mylyka.com/share/um/motoblader">https://www.mylyka.com/share/um/motoblader</a><br /><br />Play To Earn NFT Game:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thetanarena.page.link/RcYZkc5AqvgGtmYJ9">https://thetanarena.page.link/RcYZkc5AqvgGtmYJ9</a><br /><br />Please Hit the Like, Comment Subscribe for more Update Videos!<br /><br />Peace Yow!{% endraw %}
