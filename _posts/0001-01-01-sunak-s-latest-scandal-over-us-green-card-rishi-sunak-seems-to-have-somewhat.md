{% raw %}Rishi Sunak seems to have somewhat divided national loyalties. Despite being a British MP since 2015, and Chancellor since earlier 2020, Sunak has held a US green card until last Autumn. This means that he was officially intending to become a US citizen even as he was occupying the second most senior position in the UK government.
