With a little bit of digging, you can find out the owner of any property.<br /><br />This information can usually be found for free in the county's records, but some counties make it much harder than others to find what you're looking for.<br /><br />If you're looking for ONE single platform that has access to the vast majority of this public data, that's what I'm going to show you in this video.<br /><br />The service is called DataTree, and it's awesome.<br /><br />This is what I use when I'm trying to contact neighboring property owners to either:<br /><br />a) Ask if they want to buy my property, or<br />b) As if they want to sell their property to me<br /><br />DataTree is one of the fastest and easiest methods I know of to get the property owner's mailing address and send them a letter to start the conversation.<br /><br />#realestatewebsite #realestate #retipster #sethwilliams #realestateinvesting{% endraw %}
