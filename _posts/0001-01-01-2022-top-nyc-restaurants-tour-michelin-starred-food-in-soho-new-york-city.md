Two years ago, we decided it was time for Phil's ad agency to abandon the in-person, 5-day workweek. So they 86’d the office and work hours, allowing our own family to start traveling almost constantly. We now work, school, and explore in a different place every week—from our own mountain and beach homes to exotic villas, resorts, and yachts around the world. As we experience and support diverse cultures, we hope to inspire more families to design a life of freedom and adventure.<br /><br />Because there’s a new American Dream. It’s one that’s void of templated expectations, templated career paths, templated education, templated families, templated homes, and templated lives. Freedom is no longer an American tagline—it’s just the new, global way of life.<br /><br />Every day that you spend doing something that doesn’t fulfill you to your core, you’re living your life on pause. You’re deferring genuine family time with no guarantee that there will be a tomorrow or a someday. Some people follow that mentality their entire lives. We’ve chosen to never live that way again.<br /><br />We appreciate you following our journey. The more our channel grows, the more time we can spend traveling to more locations, contributing to these cultures, highlighting local businesses, and sharing inspiring stories from these communities. So please consider liking, commenting, and subscribing so that you can stick with us for the long haul.{% endraw %}
