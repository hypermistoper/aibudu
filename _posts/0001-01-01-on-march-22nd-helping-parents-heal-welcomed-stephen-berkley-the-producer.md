The story idea came with the death of Stephen’s father when — shortly afterwards — his mother began reporting interactions with whom she believed to be Dad's ghost — a real-life Mrs. Muir situation — which naturally begged the question: Are ghosts a real phenomenon or are they merely symptomatic of profound grief? Living With Ghosts is the culmination of a seven-year investigation into the nature of love, death and ghosts and features three survivors' quest for answers.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ZpRNfo2zjYQ">https://youtu.be/ZpRNfo2zjYQ</a>{% endraw %}
