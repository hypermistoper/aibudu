{% raw %}How to stain a wooden floor like a pro:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://howtosandafloor.com/how-to-stain-a-wooden-floor-like-a-pro/">https://howtosandafloor.com/how-to-stain-a-wooden-floor-like-a-pro/</a><br /><br />In this video I demonstrate the basic method of staining a wooden floor. Starting from the back of the room (furthest away from the door), staining 3 boards at a time (not more than a full arms length). Moving from right to left,either way is ok, so long as you keep going back to the side you started and moving to the side you finished.<br /><br />You use the brush against the back edge first, as long as a metre from the corner, then to the ends of, say, 3 or 4 boards. Rag the stain on thickly with one rag and dry off the excess with another.<br /><br />If the drying rag becomes too sodden, replace with a new rag.<br /><br />This is only a quick description of how to stain your wood floor, but I go into much more depth in the article linked above.<br /><br />WOOD FLOOR STAIN LINKS (Amazon Affiliate Links):<br />-UK- Morrells Light Fast Stain (New Medium Oak, the colour used in this video)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ENbBgw">https://amzn.to/2ENbBgw</a> You can just browse through to other colours<br /><br />-USA- Minwax Wood Finishes Penetrating Stain (Red Oak, browse around for the other colours)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Q9k2s6">https://amzn.to/2Q9k2s6</a><br />-----------------------------------------------------------<br />BONA TRAFFIC HD LINKS (you can change the sheen level you want)<br />-UK- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/370RXK8">https://amzn.to/370RXK8</a><br />-USA- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/34M9Nz2">https://amzn.to/34M9Nz2</a><br />------------------------------------------------------------<br />LINKS FOR ACCESSORIES<br />Roller For Lacquer<br />-UK- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Zl6OfV">https://amzn.to/2Zl6OfV</a> (the same roller used in the video for lacquering)<br />-USA- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/34J4xfL">https://amzn.to/34J4xfL</a><br /><br />Roller For Stain<br />-UK- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35NMTbL">https://amzn.to/35NMTbL</a><br />-USA- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/34LAu71">https://amzn.to/34LAu71</a><br /><br />Rags For Stain<br />-UK- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2EG1pXg">https://amzn.to/2EG1pXg</a><br />-USA- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Q721um">https://amzn.to/2Q721um</a><br /><br />Respirator (face mask)<br />-UK- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/39gcqg8">https://amzn.to/39gcqg8</a><br />-USA- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2USdr7s">https://amzn.to/2USdr7s</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://howtosandafloor.com">https://howtosandafloor.com</a>{% endraw %}
