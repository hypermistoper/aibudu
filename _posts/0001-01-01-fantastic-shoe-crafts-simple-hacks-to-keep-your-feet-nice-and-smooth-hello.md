{% raw %}Hello, crafty people! We prepared lots of unusual DIY ideas that will help you save old or broken shoes and make them look even better :)<br />First of all, we will show you a fantastic tutorial on making a unique pair of shoes from gypsum. You will need to dip your toe in alginate mix and fill the hole with gypsum. Let it harden, and then cover with hot glue (we chose glue sticks with glitter). Let it dry, and now you have a base for your fabulous shoes. Cover the ‚Äúnails‚Äù with nail polish and wear these cute foot accessories with your sandals :) It‚Äôs a super trendy and fun element that will make you stand out from the crowd ;)<br />If you broke a heel, don‚Äôt rush to throw away your shoes! You can use almost anything instead of your heel! Just don‚Äôt forget to cover it with epoxy resin. For example, we used little corn cobs, and you can see the full tutorial in the video. <br />Stay tuned to learn lots of helpful shoe hacks for both you and your kids! We also prepared a couple of tips on keeping your feet nice and smooth :)<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />00:01 ‚Äî Amazing craft for your feet<br />00:44 ‚Äî How to fix broken heels<br />01:35 ‚Äî Smart hack for kid‚Äôs flip flops<br />02:19 ‚Äî How to keep your feet smooth and soft<br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
