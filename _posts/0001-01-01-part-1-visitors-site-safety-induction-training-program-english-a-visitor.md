{% raw %}A Visitor induction animated video gives organizations the advantage of training the visitors on basic safety rules that need to be followed during their visit to the premises. The big benefit of having an animated induction is that one is able to show consequences of not following the rules and thereby grabbing the attention of the audience. Visitor inductions are the gateway to showcasing the importance of safety and are a great tool for increasing an organization’s “Reputation Capital”.<br /><br />While most visitor inductions use simple images, slides and text, our animated visitor inductions give a 360o view of holistic safety. Find out from our website as to how you can club visitor induction and ID badging software together to make a productive combination of best safety practices.<br /><br />For more information, please visit:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ask-ehs.com/animation/animated-safety-videos.htm">https://www.ask-ehs.com/animation/animated-safety-videos.htm</a>{% endraw %}
