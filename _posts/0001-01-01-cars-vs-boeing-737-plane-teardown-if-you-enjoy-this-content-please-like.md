{% raw %}If you enjoy this content, please like and Subscribe! It really helps a lot :)<br />Also, come say hi on discord!<br />I wanted to do something else for the thing that the cars attack since I've been doing so many character models. This time we have cars vs Boeing 737 Plane and both the cars and the plane are actually flying! All sorts of cars as usual, from military vehicles, to rocket carrying vehicles, to explosive vehicles, to speed racers, to public transport, to taxi cabs and police cars! They seek to destroy the plane and they must take out both of its engines. Watch till the  end to find out what happens! I hope you enjoy :)<br /><br />Join Discord Server :)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/333ktuSe3B">https://discord.gg/333ktuSe3B</a><br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFHJ50h0N_dyUr9aSm_7vBA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFHJ50h0N_dyUr9aSm_7vBA/join</a><br /><br />If you're feeling generous you can buy me a coffee!
