{% raw %}When a task that you have delegated to an employee comes back to you - and then you finish it. This is called reverse delegation or monkey business.<br />If you, as the boss, work on delegated tasks, then you do the work that your employees should actually be doing. This is fatal because then you have no time for your actual tasks.<br /><br />Has it ever happened to you that a task that you have delegated to an employee ends up back on your desk again? Does this happen to you a lot? Then you keep walking into the same trap again and again.<br />In this video, I'll show you how to avoid this back delegation in the future.{% endraw %}
