{% raw %}Sorry for the delay again everyone! There was quite a lot of editing that went into this one compared to the last one. I attempted to reduce the run time of the video but it still came out pretty long, but I still had a blast making the video as well as doing the run itself. Fourth Challenge run with the Coil Shield!<br />Took me a bit of time to do the video I just hope you guys enjoy this one just as the previous one!<br />Please comment, like, share, and subscribe. Every little bit helps. Thanks for watching!<br /><br />Music used:<br /><br />Hive Knight - Hollow Knight<br />Venice Fight - Assassin's Creed II<br />Escaping the Ruins - Ori and the Blind Forest<br />Dung Defender - Hollow Knight<br />Undying Shores - Dead Cells<br />Escaping the Sandworm - Ori and the Will of the Wisps{% endraw %}
