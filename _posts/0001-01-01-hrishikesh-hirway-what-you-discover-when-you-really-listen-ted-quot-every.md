In this profoundly moving talk, he offers a guide to deep conversations and explores what you learn when you stop to listen closely. Stay tuned to the end to hear a performance of his original song &quot;Between There and Here (feat. Yo-Yo Ma).&quot;<br /><br />Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://TED.com">http://TED.com</a> to get our entire library of TED Talks, transcripts, translations, personalized talk recommendations and more.<br /><br />The TED Talks channel features the best talks and performances from the TED Conference, where the world's leading thinkers and doers give the talk of their lives in 18 minutes (or less).
