{% raw %}To get one for a hospital near you: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aebox.finiteloop.io">https://aebox.finiteloop.io</a><br /><br />The COVID-19 pandemic exposes doctors to high risk of infection due to Sars-cov-2 aerosolis that may occur during Endotracheal Intubation. This procedure is routinely performed (outside of COVID-19 cases too) in hospitals around the world to open the airway of a patient and provide them respiratory support.<br /><br />AeBox (Aerosol Box) enables doctors to safely perform this procedure while trapping the dangerous aerosols inside the box. Inspired by solutions that surfaced on the internet at the beginning of the pandemic, we have refined the design and made it available for manufacturers around the world.<br /><br />We hope this finds a place in every ICU and Operating Theatre around the world and helps keep our frontline workers safe. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aebox.finiteloop.io">https://aebox.finiteloop.io</a>{% endraw %}
