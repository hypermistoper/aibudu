{% raw %}Although all killers are disturbing enough, children who murder are in a whole new league of their own. In other murders, most of the time there is some sort of motive or driving force that compels the individual kill, whether it is an abusive upbringing, mental health issues or a life of crime. Of course, killing is always wrong, but in most cases, we can get an insight into the mind of how they got to that point. But with children, it’s much harder to understand as we all relate the idea of innocence to children and consider them people that need protecting.<br /> <br />Well, as proven in today’s case, it doesn't take a lifetime of turmoil and abuse to become a cold-hearted killer. Welcome to Twisted minds, my name is James and today we take a look at the case of Eric Smith, a 13 year old who went on to kill a four year old in one of the worst ways imaginable.{% endraw %}
