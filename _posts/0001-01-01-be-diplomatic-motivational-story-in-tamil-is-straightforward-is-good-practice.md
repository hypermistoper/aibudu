For many of us, I'm proud to say, Stright Forward. and remember it's something heroic.<br /><br />Stright forward is not a good quality to be proud of ... There is no hero ... There is no hero for the spinner who closes his eyes and shouts on the battlefield ... The hero is the hero for the spinner who is calm and how to spin calmly ...<br /><br />Straight forward Don't be hurt by words ... &quot;Be Diplomatic&quot;<br /><br />Any Queries Please contact:<br />mindpagebox@gmail.com{% endraw %}
