{% raw %}In this video, five people with hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome run through the hEDS diagnostic criteria from 2017! Hypermobile EDS is a painful genetic connective tissue disorder that makes connective tissues abnormally weak, fragile, and stretchy, leading to chronic joint and muscle pain, joint instability and dislocations, dysautonomia, fatigue, and GI tract dysmotility, among so many other symptoms. While the diagnostic criteria help to diagnose, it barely scratches the surface of the impact of this disease. <br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL ‚ñ∂ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2M4Ko0c">http://bit.ly/2M4Ko0c</a><br />üì∏ Instagram ‚ñ∂ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/izzy.kornblau/">https://www.instagram.com/izzy.kornblau/</a><br />‚è∞ TikTok ‚ñ∂ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@izzykornblau?lang=en">https://www.tiktok.com/@izzykornblau?lang=en</a> <br />üëâ MERCHANDISE ‚ñ∂ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/izzy-kornblau">https://teespring.com/stores/izzy-kornblau</a> <br />üíã EDS/POTS ETSY STICKERS ‚ñ∂ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://etsy.me/3scgtTs">http://etsy.me/3scgtTs</a><br /><br />WANT TO BUY ME A COFFEE? üíô<br />buymeacoff.ee/izzykornblau<br /><br />HEDS DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA 2017: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ehlers-danlos.com/wp-content/uploads/hEDS-Dx-Criteria-checklist-1.pdf">https://ehlers-danlos.com/wp-content/uploads/hEDS-Dx-Criteria-checklist-1.pdf</a><br /><br />DONATE TO MUSC NORRIS LAB (EDS research in regenerative medicine): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://connect2.musc.edu/com">https://connect2.musc.edu/com</a> <br /><br />FOLLOW EVERYONE'S INSTAGRAM!<br />Sofia: @SofiaLuzbetak<br />Roman: @_rofenner_<br />Izzy (her channel): @izzy.kornblau<br />Deatra: @deatrabear<br />Katherine: @kg_singleton<br /><br />WHAT‚ÄôS EHLERS-DANLOS SYNDROME?<br />The Ehlers-Danlos Syndromes are a group of more than 13 genetic connective tissue disorders that make connective tissue abnormally weak, fragile, and stretchy. Connective tissue is found in all parts of the body, including your organs, ligaments, and joints. As a result, people with EDS can be affected in all of these areas, as well as others. The most common symptoms and co-morbidities include chronic joint pain, dysautonomia, dislocations, GI tract dysmotility, and severe joint instability, among many others. The most common type (and the type that I have) is hypermobile EDS (formerly known as Type III), which is estimated to affect around 1 in every 5,000 people. However, it's speculated by many to not be as rare as we once believed. <br /><br />MORE INFO ABOUT EDS: <br />üß¨ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/eds-types/">https://www.ehlers-danlos.com/eds-types/</a><br />üß¨ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2N95xTE">https://bit.ly/2N95xTE</a><br />MORE INFO ABOUT POTS: <br />üíì <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.potsuk.org/what_is_pots2">https://www.potsuk.org/what_is_pots2</a><br />‚ù§Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cle.clinic/2p1lByR">https://cle.clinic/2p1lByR</a><br />MORE INFO ABOUT GASTROPARESIS: <br />üíö <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mayocl.in/2BRQTuR">https://mayocl.in/2BRQTuR</a><br />MORE INFO ABOUT MUSCLE TENSION DYSPHONIA:<br />ü§ç <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2MLUYXI">https://bit.ly/2MLUYXI</a><br /><br />NEW TO MY CHANNEL?
