{% raw %}Featuring RJ Maccani, Priya Rai, Rachel Herzing, and Esteban Kelly.<br /><br />Survivor-centeredness is an important value in transformative justice. But what does it actually mean to center the needs of survivors? In this 2-part video, people with years of experience facilitating community accountability processes with survivors of harm and people who have caused harm address whether centering survivors means that survivors define or drive transformative justice processes. This video considers the complexities of honoring and upholding survivors' agency while balancing other concerns and interests. How do facilitators give survivors the time, space, and support they need while also making sure that other considerations are also incorporated into transformative justice and community accountability processes?<br /><br />Join us for an online discussion on Friday, April 10, 2020 at 4pm EST.

The Building Accountable Communities Project promotes non-punitive responses to harm by developing resources for transformative justice practitioners and organizing convenings and workshops that educate the public.<br /><br />Created by Project Nia and the Barnard Center for Research on Women.
