{% raw %}Hauling water from the creek is time-consuming.  Getting a professional rig out in the woods is problematic and expensive.  Time for some DIY well digging.  I made mistakes and it was really hot but it eventually worked out.  I will post information about the actual gear I used in the comments.  It would have been better to have a partner help and you could relay the pounding.  Overall, it was a gratifying experience to produce water. I was lucky that the water table was nice and high.  If there is anything I could have done to make the process more efficient for others please comment below.  If we can save people time or money, great.  Thanks for watching.<br /><br />Here is the model # for the sand point: Watersource Stainless Steel Well Point - For 1 1/4in. Pipe, Model# WP3680{% endraw %}
