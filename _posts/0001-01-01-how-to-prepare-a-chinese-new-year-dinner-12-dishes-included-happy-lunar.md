{% raw %}Happy Lunar New Year! The reunion dinner is the biggest event out of the entire year. I want to show you how to prepare a traditional dinner for new year's eve. We filmed an entire process of the food making, the culture behind it, and the traditions. Make sure to get a cup of coffee or tea before watching - hope you can enjoy it. <br /><br />🥢BUY MY CLAY POT - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/soupeduprecipesclaypot">https://geni.us/soupeduprecipesclaypot</a> <br /><br />🥢BUY MY CHOPSTICKS - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/Ceramic-Chopsticks">https://geni.us/Ceramic-Chopsticks</a> <br /><br />🥢BUY MY CARBON STEEL WOK - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geni.us/carbon-steel-wok">https://geni.us/carbon-steel-wok</a><br /><br />🥢BUY THE CERAMIC GARLIC GRATER - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://curatedkitchenware.com/products/ceramic-grater-for-garlic-giner-wassabi-and-more">https://curatedkitchenware.com/products/ceramic-grater-for-garlic-giner-wassabi-and-more</a><br /><br />🥢BUY THE CAT GARLIC CHOPPER - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://curatedkitchenware.com/products/electric-garlic-blender-usb-rechargeable">https://curatedkitchenware.com/products/electric-garlic-blender-usb-rechargeable</a><br /><br />🥢THE HAND-CRAFTED CARBON STEEL FRYING PAN IS NOT AVAILABLE YET.
