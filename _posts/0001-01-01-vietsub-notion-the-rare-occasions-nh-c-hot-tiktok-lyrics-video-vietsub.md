{% raw %}Vietsub | Notion - The Rare Occasions | Nhạc Hot TikTok | Lyrics:<br /><br />Sure it's a calming notion, perpetual in motion<br />But I don't need the comfort of any lies<br />For I have seen the ending and there is no ascending<br />Rise<br />Oh, back when I was younger, was told by other youngsters<br />That my end will be torture beneath the earth<br />'Cause I don't see what they see, when death is staring at me<br />I see a window, a limit, to live it, or not at all<br />If you could pull the lever to carry on forever<br />Would your life even matter anymore?<br />Sure it's a calming notion, perpetual in motion<br />But it's not what you signed up for<br />I'm sure there won't always be sunshine<br />But there's this momentary beam of light<br />You don't have to wait those salty decades<br />To get through the gate, it's all in front of your face<br />I'm sure there won't always be sunshine<br />I'm sure there won't always be sunshine<br />But there's this momentary beam of light<br />I could cross the ocean in a fit of devotion<br />For every shining second, this fragile body beckons<br />You think you're owed it better believing ancient letters<br />Sure it's a calming notion, but it's a lie<br /><br />#vietsub #Notion #TheRareOccasions #NhạcHotTikTok{% endraw %}
