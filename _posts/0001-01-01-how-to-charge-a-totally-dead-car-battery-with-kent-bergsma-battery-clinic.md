{% raw %}Watch Kent's complete Car Battery Clinic Series: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtRKk64pu2wrnK0uW_n2ubDHVdviYunPg">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtRKk64pu2wrnK0uW_n2ubDHVdviYunPg</a><br />In part 5 of this series, Kent will demonstrate a good way you can charge a super dead battery. Some battery chargers will not work unless there is some good voltage in the battery. You will need another battery and some jumpers to do this. In lieu of another battery you can also use a battery booster.{% endraw %}
