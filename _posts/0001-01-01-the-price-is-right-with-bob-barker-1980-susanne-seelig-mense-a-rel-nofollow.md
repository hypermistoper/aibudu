The idea was to get on The Price is Right. What a graduation gift!  I think it was for her more at the time... but thats ok. <br /><br />The is how the story goes. Being from Montreal, we sent away for studio audience tickets. The first day at the show my mom and I stood in line and we were interviewed by the producers. The entire studio audience was interviewed one by one. You had 5 seconds to convince them you would be fun on the show. I tried to be sophisticated and classy. That didn't work! I was not selected to be on the show the day. I guess I was too boring!<br /><br />We skipped the next day and went to Universal studios instead.<br /><br />Our strategy changed for the following day! I remember one of the producers was watching the people lin line.  (Phil) I acted wild and crazy in the line this time and  he noticed. I was so shocked to find out I was picked when they called out my name! What a thrill!!!<br /><br />It is totally legit! I had no idea!!!! By the way I still have the prizes  won!<br /><br />Great time! A wonderful memory with my mom. Cant believe how young I was at the time.I still have the prizes and its been 40 years. Bob Barker was wonderful!!!<br /><br />Susanne.{% endraw %}
