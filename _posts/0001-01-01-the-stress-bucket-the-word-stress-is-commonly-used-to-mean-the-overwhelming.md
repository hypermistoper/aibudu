{% raw %}The word 'stress' is commonly used to mean the overwhelming feeling of anxiety we experience when problems or pressures are just too great and we don't think we can cope.<br /><br />A moderate level of stress can be useful in situations where we need to perform well such as working to a tight deadline or competing in a competition.<br /><br />The point at which we might start to struggle is very personal - everyone's perception of what is stressful is different and everyone has different problems and demands.<br /><br />Watch this animation of the 'stress bucket' - the water being poured into the bucket represents stress. Too much stress and the bucket fills up and overflows.<br /><br />www.mindwell-leeds.org.uk/stress{% endraw %}
