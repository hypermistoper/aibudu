{% raw %}This is an urgent job to repair a cylinder rod for a 988 Loader on stand down AND a new machine for the workshop arrives! Watch to find out what it is. In this video we show a job we did to make a new hydraulic cylinder rod for a Caterpillar 988G Wheel Loader. The rod has damage to the chrome and the machine is on stand down, every day that is costing our customer money so this one is an urgent repair. This shows the step by step process to make the new cylinder rod including machining and welding. We machine the eye off the old rod before machining up the new cylinder rod using a 5‚Äù inch diameter induction hardened chrome bar. We need to machine both ends of the cylinder rod, the first end we machine through the induction hardened chrome layer before turning down the OD to fit the piston and cutting the 12tpi external thread for the nut. Then we machine the other end of the rod to weld prep for the rod eye by machining a bevel and drilling a hole for the eye spigot. We complete the job by welding the eye to the rod using our WIA 500i weldmatic welder with dual shield flux core wire.<br /><br />In this video we are using:<br />- TM-26120G Centre Lathe<br />- WIA 500i Weldmatic welder <br /><br />Join our channel:<br />We upload new videos every Friday at 5pm AEST!
