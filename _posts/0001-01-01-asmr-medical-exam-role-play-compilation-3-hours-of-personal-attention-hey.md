I was a BetterHelp customer myself before partnering with them and I had a great experience, I have a close friend who currently uses BetterHelp and absolutely loves it, and I have another good friend who works as a therapist through the BetterHelp platform. While different therapy options will be better or less suited to different people, BetterHelp may be the most affordable, most accessible, and most flexible option for many people. Please know that I take your trust and well-being very seriously, and I would not recommend this service if I didn‚Äôt feel confident about doing so. However, I encourage you to do your own research about the different therapy options available to you, since there is no one-size-fits-all best choice, and ultimately you know you best.‚ù§Ô∏è<br />PLEASE NOTE: Since I have a paid partnership with BetterHelp, signing up for their service via my unique link does help support me and this channel.<br />üíöüíÅ‚ú®TRY ONLINE THERAPY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tryonlinetherapy.com/Jellybeangreen">https://www.tryonlinetherapy.com/Jellybeangreen</a><br /><br />‚ñ∫Patreon: Viewer contributions are a huge help in allowing me to create regular, high quality content.
