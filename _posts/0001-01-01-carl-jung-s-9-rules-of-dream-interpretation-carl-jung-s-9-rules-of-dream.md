{% raw %}Carl Jung's 9 Rules of Dream Interpretation<br />In this video, I explore Carl Jung's ideas around dream analysis and dream interpretation. Jung was very open and flexible in approaching the mysterious nature of dreams in his psychiatric sessions with patients. Although there always has to remain an openness to the interpretation of dreams, Jung has outlined quite a few 'rules' that are based on his experience and conceptualization of the unconscious. These dream interpretation rules are like guidelines to keep us from getting lost in the mysterious nature of the unconscious psychic activity - that receive as dreams.<br /><br />Other videos on Carl Jung and Dream Analysis from other channels:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpDPHXIPq1Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VpDPHXIPq1Q</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZQ5nx7-i8A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bZQ5nx7-i8A</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0KzUS0b_uc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0KzUS0b_uc</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5frV6KrNsL0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5frV6KrNsL0</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDfgHcCKlX4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDfgHcCKlX4</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K5OuTVcdF8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8K5OuTVcdF8</a><br /><br />My other video, Carl Jung: Introduction to Dream Analysis:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtH-jassAaQ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtH-jassAaQ</a>{% endraw %}
