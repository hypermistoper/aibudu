{% raw %}An ancient Japanese boulder that's 'Imprisoned a demon for 1,000 years' has mysteriously split in two with fear that dark forces have been unleashed.<br /><br />The Sessho-seki aka The Killing Stone, is a volcanic rock that supposedly houses an evil spirit and sits on an active volcano in central Japan, not far from Tokyo.<br /><br />According to Japanese mythology, the stone is believed to have hosted an evil spirit and be so powerful that it kills anyone who comes in contact with it<br /><br />After the stone's split in two on March 5th, Japanese locals and online users have raised concerns of the stone continually spewing out poisonous gas.<br /><br />The stone is believed to be the transformed body of Tamamo-no-Mae, a beautiful woman who was exposed as a nine-tailed fox working for an evil daimyō plotting to kill Emperor Konoe and take his throne.<br /><br />According to the otogi-zōshi, when the nine-tailed fox was killed by the famous warrior Miura-no-suke, its body became the Sessho-seki.<br /><br />Later, a Buddhist priest called Genno stopped for a rest near the stone and was threatened by the spirit of Tamamo-no-Mae.<br /><br />Genno performed exorcism rituals and begged the spirit to consider her salvation. Tamamo-no-Mae relented and swore never to haunt the stone again.<br /><br />Officials in the region said there had been a crack in the stone for some time and that rain and freezing temperatures may have led to the splitting of the stone.<br /><br />Masaharu Sugawara, chairman of the Nasu Kogen Yumoto Guide Club, said: &quot;It's natural, so it can't be helped but it's a shame because it's a symbol of the local area.&quot;<br /><br />The stone was registered as a local historic site in 1957 and was mentioned in Matsuo Basho's seminal work The Narrow Road to the Deep North.<br /><br />Music: Today's Plan - Dj Freedem<br />Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://patrynworldlatestnews.blogspot.com">https://patrynworldlatestnews.blogspot.com</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/patryn.worldlatestnews">https://www.facebook.com/patryn.worldlatestnews</a>{% endraw %}
