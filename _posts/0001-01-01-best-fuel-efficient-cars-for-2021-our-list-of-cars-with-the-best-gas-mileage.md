{% raw %}Our list of cars with the best gas mileage consists of only hybrid vehicles.<br /><br />We based our list on 2020 combined city/highway fuel economy estimates provided by the EPA. We did not include any fully electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, though a few automakers offer these cars in plug-in hybrid and all-electric configurations, so we’ve noted that where necessary. Any ties in fuel economy will be broken by each vehicles’ MSRP, with the lower-priced car taking the higher rank.<br /><br />Chapters-<br />0:00 Intro<br />1:27 Kia Optima Hybrid<br />2:14 Ford Fusion Hybrid <br />3:20 Lexus ES 300h Hybrid <br />4:20 Toyota Avalon Hybrid <br />5:26 Honda Accord Hybrid <br />6:08 Toyota Camry Hybrid <br />6:55 Toyota Corolla Hybrid <br />7:45 Honda Insight Hybrid <br />8:29 Toyota Prius <br />9:23 Hyundai Ioniq{% endraw %}
