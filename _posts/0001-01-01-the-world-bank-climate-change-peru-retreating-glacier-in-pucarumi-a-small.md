{% raw %}In Pucarumi, a small community in the foothills of the snow-capped Peruvian Andes, Felipe mulls the fate of the life-giving Ausangate glacier. Year after year, the great white glacier of his boyhood has receded and slowly turned black.<br /><br /><br /><br />World Bank in Peru:<br /><br />www.worldbank.org/peru<br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;We are feeling the effects of climate change,&quot; says Felipe, an alpaca herder whose animals graze on pastures irrigated by Ausangate's waters. &quot;This loss of snow means we receive less water. This climatic factor is causing us great danger.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />Less water has meant less pasture and more difficulty raising livestock. Animals such as alpaca and sheep aren't eating enough, &quot;so their wool doesn't grow as well,&quot; forcing people to turn to synthetic wool to weave hats, sweaters, and scarves.<br /><br /><br /><br />The World Bank{% endraw %}
