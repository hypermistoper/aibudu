{% raw %}Global Warming Policy Foundation Director Dr Benny Peiser says most Australians are probably &quot;not aware&quot; of the &quot;disastrous energy crisis&quot; in Europe.<br /><br />&quot;Energy bills have doubled in the last 12 months and are threatening to triple - a quarter of UK households won't be able to afford paying their bills,&quot; he told Sky News host Peta Credlin.<br /><br />Dr Peiser said Europe is facing the &quot;worst energy crisis since World War Two&quot; and it is &quot;only getting worse&quot; as the war in Ukraine intensifies.<br /><br />&quot;People in Australia should be very aware of what happens if you are not careful with your energy policy. &quot;{% endraw %}
