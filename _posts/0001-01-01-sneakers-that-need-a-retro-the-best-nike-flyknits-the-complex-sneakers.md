{% raw %}The Complex Sneakers Podcast is co-hosted by Joe La Puma, Brendan Dunne, and Matt Welty. This week, the three hosts talk about sneakers they want to see come back, like Arnold Schwarzenegger's Nike lifting shoe, the Nike Air Burst, and the Joe-favorite Air Zoom Citizen. They also reflect on the early days of Nike Flyknit, which launched 10 years ago now. Joe gives a breakdown of the latest Kith trip, Brendan explains Treefort Music Fest in Boise, and Welty starts laying out plans for the Complex Sneakers Glizzy Tour. <br /><br />Looking for the Complex Sneakers Podcast Dad Hats?
