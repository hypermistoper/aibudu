{% raw %}Hi everyone, this was my first completed model of 2021, and I'm glad that in 2022 I'm finally able to present this kit to you. This is an older model, and this boxing was the last time it was produced. Given its age, this is still a really fun model, and one that I hope to build a few more times in the future.<br /><br />Decals were purchased from Leading Edge Model:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://lemdecal.com/">http://lemdecal.com/</a><br /><br />Music:<br />Scott Buckley - Solecism<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/2020/11/solecism/">https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/2020/11/solecism/</a><br /><br />Scott Buckley - Snowfall<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/library/snowfall/">https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/library/snowfall/</a><br /><br />Scott Buckley - Falling Together<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/library/falling-together/">https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/library/falling-together/</a><br /><br />Scott Buckley - Inflection<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/library/inflection/">https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/library/inflection/</a><br /><br />Scott Buckley - Omega<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/library/omega/">https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/library/omega/</a><br /><br />Scott Buckley - The Miracle of Flight<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/library/the-miracle-of-flight/">https://www.scottbuckley.com.au/library/the-miracle-of-flight/</a><br /><br />#harvard #texan #rcaf{% endraw %}
