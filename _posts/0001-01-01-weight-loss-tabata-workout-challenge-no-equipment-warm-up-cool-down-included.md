{% raw %}I know what youre thinking: TABATA FOR 40 MINS?!?! COME ON JO! haha but here's the secret; this workout is 40 minutes long, but only 19 minutes of it is true tabata style.<br /><br />We have an extended warm up and cool down in this workout to make sure that you get the most out of todays' session. Honestly I think this workout may be your new favorite as all the exercises are fun but also challenging, and we ease in and ease out with the same enthusiasm.<br /><br />Here is the structure of the workout<br />10 mins warm up<br />9 mins tabata<br />1 min rest<br />10 mins tabata (with bonus finisher)<br />10 mins cool down<br /><br />This method has helped me tremendously during my weight loss journey, and can be down by combining some of my other videos (dance party to warm up, tabata/HIIT session to workout, cool down session to get your body prepared for tomorrows session), or you can do it all in one video here!<br /><br />If you read this entire caption through, make sure to comment below something you have accomplished this month in your health and fitness journey.
