{% raw %}This video highlights just some of the physical consequences, social challenges and profound emotional experiences of people affected by epilepsy.   Some of the people we work with speak candidly about the wider effects that epilepsy has had on their life.  <br /><br />Epilepsy can provoke strong emotions including depression and suicidal thoughts, and feelings of bereavement can result from the thought that epilepsy has robbed you of the person you were and completely changed your plans for the future.<br /><br />We hear of two experiences, one in public with colleagues in the workplace and one with a friend in a social setting, where knowledge about epilepsy would have made a difference.  <br /><br />We also hear how individuals affected by epilepsy can sustain severe injuries including burns, but injuries commonly sustained during seizures can range from cuts and bruises to serious head injuries.  In themselves the physical impacts of epilepsy can be life changing.  <br /><br />Please be aware that the DVD footage contains graphic images of injuries resulting from seizures. <br /><br />If you are affected by any of tonight's stories and want to talk in confidence about your own experiences, call our Freephone helpline on 0808 800 2200.{% endraw %}
