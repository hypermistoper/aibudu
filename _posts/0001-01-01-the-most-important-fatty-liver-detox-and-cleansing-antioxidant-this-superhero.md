Find out why!<br /><br />DATA:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10566232/">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10566232/</a> <br /><br />0:00 Introduction: The most important fatty liver detox and cleansing antioxidant<br />1:48 What is glutathione? <br />2:22 Benefits of glutathione for your liver<br />4:39 What causes low glutathione? <br />5:43 How to increase glutathione <br />7:14 Key takeaways  <br />8:00 Check out one of my other videos on the liver! <br /><br />In this video, we’re going to talk about the most important fatty liver detox and cleansing antioxidant: glutathione. <br /><br />On a standard American diet, you overload your liver with carbs. This causes many liver problems, including a fatty liver. The body runs best on ketones, which are also great for your liver health. <br /><br />Many people have spent years on an unhealthy high-carb diet that causes serious damage to the liver. <br /><br />How can you promote the health of a damaged liver with nutrition? The answer is glutathione. <br /><br />Glutathione is a superhero antioxidant that helps protect and repair the liver. <br /><br />There are more than 100,000 peer-reviewed papers on glutathione in scientific journals. Low glutathione is linked to at least 75 major diseases. <br /><br />According to research, glutathione:<br />• Prevents liver damage, including a fatty liver<br />• Detoxifies the liver and reduces oxidative stress<br />• Reduces exercise fatigue<br />• Counters insulin resistance <br />• Helps protect your mitochondria <br /><br />There are nine common things that deplete glutathione:<br />1. Alcohol<br />2. Trauma<br />3. Stress<br />4. Toxins<br />5. Infection<br />6. Junk food<br />7. Aging<br />8. Overtraining <br />9. Sugar and refined carbs<br /><br />The best ways to boost your glutathione are:<br />• Beef<br />• Fish<br />• Cruciferous vegetables<br />• Garlic<br />• Onion<br />• NAC<br />• Curcumin<br />• Melatonin<br />• Vitamin D3<br />• SAMe<br />• Alpha-lipoic acid<br /><br />ADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description">https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description</a><br /><br />FREE COURSE➜ ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse">http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse</a><br /><br />Talk to a Product Advisor to find the best product for you!<br />Call 1-540-299-1556 with your questions about Dr. Berg's products.

His use of “doctor” or “Dr.” in relation to himself solely refers to that degree.  Dr. Berg is a licensed chiropractor in Virginia, California, and Louisiana, but he no longer practices chiropractic in any state and does not see patients so he can focus on educating people as a full time activity, yet he maintains an active license.

It should not be used to self-diagnose and it is not a substitute for a medical exam, cure, treatment, diagnosis, and prescription or recommendation.  It does not create a doctor-patient relationship between Dr. Berg and you.  You should not make any change in your health regimen or diet before first consulting a physician and obtaining a medical exam, diagnosis, and recommendation.
