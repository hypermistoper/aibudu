We're also getting slightly philosophical here by  asking what they would do differently if they had the chance to live their lives again. <br />---<br />PRODUCED BY:<br />Easy Languages is an international video project aiming at supporting people worldwide to learn languages through authentic street interviews and expose the street culture of participating partner countries abroad. Episodes are produced in local languages and contain subtitles in both the original language as well as in English.<br />---<br />Host of this episode: Janusz Hamerski/Carina Schmid <br />Camera &amp; Edit: Rawad Sabbagh<br />Translation: Ben Eve{% endraw %}
