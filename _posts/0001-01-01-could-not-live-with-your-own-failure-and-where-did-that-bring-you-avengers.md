His casual clothes transform into his armour and cape, with his beard getting some braid treatment. Let's kill him properly this time.<br /><br />The Big Three (Avengers) walk over to confront Thanos face to face<br /><br />THANOS: You could not live with your own failure. And where did that bring you? Back to me. I thought by eliminating half of life, the other half would thrive. But youâ€™ve shown me thatâ€™s impossible. And as long as there are those that remember what was, there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. They will resist.<br /><br /><br />THANOS: I will shred this universe down to its last atom. Thanos puts on his helmet. And thenâ€“ With the stones you've collected for me, create a new one. Teeming with life, but knows not what it has lost but only what it has been given. <br /><br />The fighting starts, and Thor and Tony go straight at Thanos. Meanwhile, Hulk is under all of the mess trying to hold up the structure. Rhodey and Rocket are breathing for their lives.<br /><br />Avengers: Endgame is a 2019 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures.
