{% raw %}As gas and other energy prices continue to soar, Americans are desperate for relief. The question is, what does Congress plan to do about it?<br /> <br />Rep. Debbie Lesko, a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has some answers on today’s edition of “The Daily Signal Podcast.”<br /> <br />Lesko, R-Ariz., pledges that if the GOP regains the majority in Congress, lawmakers will act swiftly to reduce gas prices and increase America’s energy independence.<br /> <br />“Republicans will introduce legislation to codify into law some of the rules and regulations that the Trump administration put forward … to reduce the time for permitting of new production facilities, reduce the time of permitting for new pipelines, and help Americans increase U.S. oil and gas production,” Lesko says.<br /> <br />“When Republicans come into control, we want to put America first,” she says.<br /> <br />Lesko discusses the Biden administration’s failure to manage gas prices, and what congressional Republicans see as the solutions.{% endraw %}
