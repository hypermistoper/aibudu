{% raw %}The River Thames is a giant liquid history book. Each object can reveal some fascinating events from the past.  This was the case with a brass tag stamped with letters and figures. It has laid undiscovered wedged deep in the mud between two bricks for 130 years.  And then I found it, and on researching it, it uncovered the story of the first submarine cables laid beneath the atlantic, leading to the first ever telegraph.   This of course revolutionised communication - when the first transatlantic cable was laid in 1856.    <br /><br />I also could do with some ID on my finds so please take a look and see if you can help.<br /><br />And don't miss out on adopting a Tideline Art Thames Orphan. I have found so many lost toys during my mudlarking outings and it's time to put a few up for adoption. You can find them at:-<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/nicolawhitetidelineart/shop">https://ko-fi.com/nicolawhitetidelineart/shop</a><br /><br />In my video you will also meet Kevin Dyer who has a youtube channel which is definitely worth a watch.
