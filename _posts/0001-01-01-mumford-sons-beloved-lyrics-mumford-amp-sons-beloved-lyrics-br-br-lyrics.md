{% raw %}Mumford &amp; Sons - Beloved (Lyrics)<br /><br />(Lyrics)<br />Austere enthroned in white grandeur<br />But tired a shift<br />A whisper of where you sailed ahead<br />From your eyes<br />I'd never seen you unkempt before<br />As you whispered &quot;Darling close the door&quot;<br />Well how, have I not made a note of every word<br />You ever said<br />Time, is not on our side<br />But I pretend that it's alright<br />She says the Lord has a plan<br />But admits it's pretty hard to understand<br /><br />[Refrain]<br />Before you leave you must know you are beloved<br />And before you leave, remember I was with you<br /><br />[Verse 2]<br />Are you afraid<br />How ever could you not be<br />In this rosy light<br />This is strange<br />I feel a hand come through the mirror<br />Pointing at the light<br />Pointing at the light we never see<br />As you put your feathered arms over me<br /><br />[Refrain]<br />Before you leave you must know you are beloved<br />And before you leave remember I was with you<br />And as you leave<br />I won't hold you back beloved<br /><br />[Bridge]<br />You sit<br />And talk the stars down from the sky<br />Down there, forget the chaos in your eyes love<br /><br />[Refrain]<br />And as you leave you must know you are beloved<br />And as you leave I can see the wild has come for you<br />And as you leave I won't hold you back beloved<br />And as you leave see my children playing at your feet<br /><br />Subscribe and press (üîî) to join the Notification Squad and stay updated with new uploads<br /><br /><br /><br />Follow Matrix Sound:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuWxaXJSg3T9cdVrRfbFLA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnuWxaXJSg3T9cdVrRfbFLA</a><br /><br />¬©Ô∏è If any producer or label has an issue with this song or picture, please get in contact with us and we will delete it immediately.<br /><br />#BelovedLyrics{% endraw %}
