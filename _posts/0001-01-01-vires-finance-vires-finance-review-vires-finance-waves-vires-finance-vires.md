Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to take a loan in an overcollateralized manner.<br /><br />About Vires Finance<br />Vires.finance utilises common pool-based mechanics where all the funds deposited participate in interest-bearing activities equally. The greater the demand for borrowing an asset is, the greater APY lenders get in return.<br /><br />Why use vires.finance?<br />Vires.finance utilizes common pool-based mechanics where all funds deposited participate in interest-bearing activities equally.
