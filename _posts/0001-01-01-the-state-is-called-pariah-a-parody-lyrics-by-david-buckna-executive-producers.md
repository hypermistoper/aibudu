Lerner and music by Frederick Loewe for their 1951 Broadway musical, Paint Your Wagon, which is set in the California Gold Rush. Rufus Smith originally sang the song on Broadway, and Joseph Leader was the original singer in London's West End. It quickly became a runaway hit, and during the Korean War, the song was among the &quot;popular music listened to by the troops&quot;. Vaughn Monroe and his Orchestra recorded the song in 1951, and it was among the &quot;popular hit singles at the record stores&quot; that year. It has since become a standard, performed by many notable singers across several genres of popular music. A striking feature of the song in the original orchestration (also used in many cover versions), is a driving, rhythmic pattern, played on the string instruments, that evokes a sense of restless motion.<br /><br />It has been referred to as Paint Your Wagon's &quot;best known song&quot; and &quot;rousing but plaintive.&quot; Musicologist Stephen Citron wrote, &quot;Perhaps the most unusual song in the score is a beautiful ballad of lonely prospectors hungering for their women, &quot;They Call the Wind Maria&quot; – not chauvinistic in this case, for each man is yearning for his own girl.&quot;  Lehman Engel wrote that the song &quot;has a cowboy flavor&quot;, and commented that &quot;In the lyric, its folk quality is accentuated.&quot; Engel concluded that &quot;Lerner has invented an interesting kind of narration&quot;. Princeton University historian Robert V. Wells wrote that it is &quot;a sad and wistful song about being far from home&quot;. Theater historian Don B. Wilmeth called the song &quot;haunting&quot;, and said that it evokes &quot;emptiness&quot;.<br /><br />Members of the Western Writers of America chose it as one of the Top 100 Western songs of all time.{% endraw %}
