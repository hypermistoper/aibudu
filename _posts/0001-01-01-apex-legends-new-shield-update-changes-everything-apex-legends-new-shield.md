{% raw %}Apex Legends New Shield Update Changes Everything<br /><br />In today's video I go over a new item known as the shield capacitor, and this is going to be one of the biggest shield updates we've had in a while as it's something quite game changing if it works the way we are predicting it to. That's why I share my thoughts on how it might work as well as answer some questions other people have had on this. Once again we see something that can change the way we play the game, quite exciting! Hope you enjoy :)<br /><br />Reddit Post With Leak: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ApexUncovered/comments/sz20dj/medium_shield_capacitor/">https://www.reddit.com/r/ApexUncovered/comments/sz20dj/medium_shield_capacitor/</a><br /><br />Discord:<br />The Bruddahood Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/XjKDPaB4">https://discord.gg/XjKDPaB4</a><br />(If The Link Doesn't Work, Check The One On My Newest Vid)<br /><br />Health Bar Overlay Made By Cobalt: Coba1t # 8904{% endraw %}
