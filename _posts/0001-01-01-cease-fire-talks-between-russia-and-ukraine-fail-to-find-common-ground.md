{% raw %}Ukraine and Russia made &quot;no progress&quot; towards agreeing on a 24-hour cease-fire after talks in Turkey, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said after a meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. &quot;It seems that there are other decision-makers for this matter in Russia,&quot; Dmytro Kuleba said, in a thinly veiled reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin, suggesting the decision was out of Moscow Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's hands. Kuleba described his meeting with Lavrov in Antalya as &quot;difficult&quot; and accused his opposite number of bringing &quot;traditional narratives&quot; to the table. &quot;I want to repeat that Ukraine has not surrendered, does not surrender, and will not surrender,&quot; Kuleba said.<br /><br />In a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French President Emmanuel Macron called for a halt to military action in Ukraine. Macron and Scholz also told Putin on Thursday that any resolution to the war in Ukraine needed to come through negotiations between Ukraine and Russia, an official said.<br /><br />Russia's Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said he did not believe that Russia's standoff with the West over Ukraine would lead to nuclear war. &quot;I don't want to believe, and I do not believe, that a nuclear war could start,&quot; he told a news conference After meeting Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. Lavrov also dismissed the prospect of an attack on any Baltic nation, saying the suggestions from the West are &quot;old hoaxes.&quot; The Russian diplomat made no indication of any concessions to Kyiv, reiterating Russian demands that Ukraine be disarmed and accept neutral status. He also blamed the West for intensifying the conflict by arming Ukraine. Thursday's meeting between the top diplomats was the first since Russian invaded Ukraine on February 24. There had been previous talks between officials in Belarus, and Lavrov said the door for negotiations had not closed. &quot;Today's meeting has confirmed that the Russian-Ukrainian format in Belarus has no alternative,&quot; he said. Lavrov did not rule out a possible meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy to discuss &quot;specific&quot; issues.<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />For more news go to: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dw.com/en/">http://www.dw.com/en/</a><br />Follow DW on social media:<br />►Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/">https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/</a><br />►Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/dwnews">https://twitter.com/dwnews</a><br />►Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dwnews">https://www.instagram.com/dwnews</a><br />Für Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch">https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch</a><br />#Ukraine #Russa #Cease-Fire{% endraw %}
