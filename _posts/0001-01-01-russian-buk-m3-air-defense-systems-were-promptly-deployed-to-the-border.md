{% raw %}Russia has deployed its latest Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missile systems to the border with Ukraine.<br /><br />Due to the threat of an attack on Russia and the self-proclaimed republics, Russia promptly deployed its latest Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missile systems and an ultra-long-range radar from the S-400 air defense system to the border with Ukraine. The deployment of these weapons on the border with Ukraine indicates an extremely high level of danger, especially considering that we are talking about at least an entire division.<br />On the presented video frames, published on the Web a few days ago, you can see the process of transferring the Buk-M3 anti-aircraft missile systems. On the latter, you can notice the absence of missiles, however, the Buk-MZ may well be additionally deployed to the places of combat deployment of these weapons. It is noteworthy that these systems are considered among the best in the fight against unmanned aerial vehicles and tactical missile weapons of the enemy. This indicates that Russia plans to fight the Ukrainian Bayraktar TB2 strike drones.<br />In addition, Russian 91N6 radars were also seen in the Belgorod region, capable of detecting any air targets at distances up to 600 kilometers. This allows you to control the airspace in most of Ukraine, and if necessary, the Buk-M3 complexes can be integrated with this radar.<br />It should be noted that S-300V complexes were also identified in the border region, which will also have to ensure the security of the Russian borders and cover the airspace over the Donbass.{% endraw %}
