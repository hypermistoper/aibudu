{% raw %}They say there is some positive that comes from every negative. Whether this is believable is to be seen but I can tell you that it does appear to be true on today's episode where I&quot;m hauling in a big spruce tree that broke off landed on one of my snowmobile trails. Although I never like to see such a big tree just snapping off like this, all things happen for a reason and it seems like that reason was for me to make beautiful lumber out of it. First things first, I&quot;m making my way through the woods to the location of this big spruce tree in order to take off all the limbs and cut the tall tree into sections with my trusty Husqvarna chainsaw. Just getting to this location through the deep snow and across a little creek turns out to be a task but the reward of having a 22&quot; diameter tree to mill is worth it. After much cutting with my 60cc chainsaw, I get my 40hp Kioti tractor into position along with my Wallenstein FX85 skidding winch in order to pull the big logs out of the woods and onto my skidding trail. Watch as I maneuver these 4 logs in a way that looks easy despite the challenging terrain. After getting the logs across the creek and through the snow to the landing, I skid all 4 logs to my sawmill uphill on snowy trails with the help of my studied tire chains. Glad you're all here to watch this go down and hope everyone has a chance to get out to the woods before long! Here we go!<br /><br />Tractor shown in this video: 2012 Kioti DK40se HST<br />Skidding winch shown in this video: Wallenstein FX85  <br />Tractor Tire Chains: Trygg Fast-Trac <br />Chainsaw shown in this video: Husqvarna 555 auto-tune{% endraw %}
