{% raw %}Let's draw with me Ornament Ball Christmas Tree and learn how to draw Happy New Year and Christmas drawings! It's very easy art tutorial, only follow me step by step, if you need more time, you can make pause. <br /><br />I use a black marker to show the drawing better, but it will be easier to begin drawing with a pencil, so that you can correct it with an eraser. Then the drawing is ready, you outline it with a black marker and then color it with colored pencils or oil pastel. <br /><br />Thank you for watching!
