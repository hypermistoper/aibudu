{% raw %}I've been told by an extended member of my family that  I'm selfish for ranting about losing my family's freedom to travel for extended periods, work, live and plan to retire in Europe …instead of honouring the public vote based on a fraudulent referendum funded with Russian money... It was just a privilege and I have a blinkered vision and am not seeing the bigger picture… that's what they say... The problem is - no one can tell me what the bigger picture is?  Anyone else experienced this please leave it in the comments down below. What is this &quot;bigger picture&quot;?...<br />The bigger picture is an insular isolated backward leaning country, led by shabby, lying, self-serving over-privileged Tory posh boys cheered on by a mean spirited xenophobic public minority...<br />Blue passports &amp; sovereignty. And free British fish. And no more brown people… and deep-seated hatred for the Tampon Tax...<br />They told me it's So much more important than freedom to travel &amp; work &amp; live in a multicultural set of countries...<br />Constantly. I'm told this is short term pain for long term gain… and the troubles in Dover are teething troubles...But no one has been able to provide me with one tangible benefit of Brexit not one...just waffle...and when I say that they hate brown people all I get is...Not all those who voted leave were racists…but we known all racists voted leave...<br />So what is the bigger picture…?<br />The bigger picture is some dude in a hedge fund connected to a bunch of politicians is making loads of money and the politicians will all be taken care of and this has been exposed and subsequently covered up...<br />The right for the rich rightwing elite to continue offshoring their wealth and evading/avoiding paying tax, oh and the same elite disaster capitalists profiting from the economic disaster Brexit is/will be whilst avoiding/evading tax…<br />So yet again what is the bigger picture?...<br />A Shrunken economy...<br />Trade barriers/red tape...<br />Reduced influence on the international stage…<br />Excluded from Science<br />Loss of 800million a week<br />Restricted travel/study/living <br />Hard-working souls forced to leave<br />opportunities...<br />Shortage of key workers…<br />Exports slashed…<br />Neonicotinoids in our food <br />Roaming charges...<br />Fishing and farming industries have thrown under the Brexit bus… <br />Northern Ireland outcasted...<br />Scotland ignored but Ian Blackford has something to say about that...<br />Empowerment of racists...<br />Bunch of liars in government during a global pandemic….<br />No tangible benefits unless the Crown stamp on the pint glass, blue passports and the Tampon Tax...<br />You're really not seeing the bigger picture… would be most so kind as add to the list?...<br />Oh I have another...Nigel Farage is offering Valentine's Video messages via Thrillz are you excited...<br /><br />Let's Re-wild and 'BUY A TREE' Phase 1<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gofund.me/f578238f">https://gofund.me/f578238f</a><br /><br />Please Check out our other Videos as YouTube does not always send out NOTIFICATIONS<br /><br />SUPPORT US HERE:<br />BUY ME A COFFEE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/allshorts">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/allshorts</a><br />PATREON <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/allshorts">https://www.patreon.com/allshorts</a><br /><br />With your support, I won't add mid-roll adverts<br /><br />SUPPORT US HERE:<br />BUY ME A COFFEE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/allshorts">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/allshorts</a><br />PATREON <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/allshorts">https://www.patreon.com/allshorts</a><br /><br />Follow us Here:<br />TicTok <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@allshortsexposed">https://www.tiktok.com/@allshortsexposed</a> @allshortsexposed<br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/wallybois">https://twitter.com/wallybois</a><br />Wallybois Woodworking Channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/WallyboisWoodworking">https://www.youtube.com/c/WallyboisWoodworking</a><br />Wallybois Woodworking Site <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wallybois.com/">https://www.wallybois.com/</a><br />Website will all videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.allshorts.eu/">https://www.allshorts.eu/</a> <br /><br />COOL T-SHIRTS and other  Merchandise on Teespring<br />GO BACK.
