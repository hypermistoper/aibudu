That takes a lot of guys.<br /><br />But this Startup looks to be doing exactly that. Or at least that's what they want to make us think they are doing. <br /><br />For years, the world has been looking for a great alternative to fossil fuels. Sadly, none of the available alternatives have been able to really prove themselves as feasible alternatives to fossil fuels. <br /><br />Green hydrogen, for example, is one of the leading contenders looking to take the place of fossil fuels in our society. Unfortunately, even green energy has its problems.<br /><br />Green hydrogen is a gas with low volumetric energy density. This means that it's extremely expensive to store, transport, and use. Coincidentally, this isn't a problem that green hydrogen alone has. <br /><br />It's a problem that every alternative energy source, from wind power to solar power, has. <br /><br />However, what if a startup suddenly discovered and patented a technique that made it possible for us to store hydrogen as a solid. . .and do it cheaply too? <br /><br />That would totally revolutionize the system, wouldn't it? Of course, it would. <br /><br />Let's start at the very beginning. <br /><br />Hydrogen is already a key part of fuel cell electric vehicles. Many of these vehicles, including trucks and ships, run on fuel cells because they require a level of power that regular batteries cannot match yet. <br /><br />However, these fuel cell EVs cannot scale because of a lot of reasons, chief amongst them being the fact that these vehicles are simply too expensive to make and operate because of the difficulties that come with getting access to ready green hydrogen. <br /><br />The cheapest FCEV, for example, is the Toyota Mirai and it costs around $57,000, while there are Tesla's that go for less than $40,000.<br /><br />Of course, one could argue that FCEVs have a shorter charging time than regular electric vehicles and even have a longer range, but EVs are currently cheaper and use fuel a lot more efficiently than FCEVs.<br /><br />___________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />ü§© The Tesla Domain is the Number 1 channel to go when you want to be up to date with the latest Tesla news, rumors, and insights.
