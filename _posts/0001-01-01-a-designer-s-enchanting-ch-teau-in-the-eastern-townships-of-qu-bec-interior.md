{% raw %}Interior Designer Scott Yetman gives us a tour of his enchanting French country home named Fox Hill. Step into a rotunda entrance with 22-foot-high ceilings, black and white checkerboard floors and an ethereal mural that soars to the ceiling. Antique doors lead into the great room, where a dining room and living room overlook the beautiful Lac-Brome. Scott’s signature black and white palette can be seen throughout, such as in the moody bar area and expansive cook’s kitchen that features a walk-in fridge, charcoal BBQ, and two types of ovens. The laundry room gets a dose of color with yellow wallpaper designed by Kit Kemp in London.<br /><br />Design, Scott Yetman Design, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sydinteriors.com">https://sydinteriors.com</a><br /><br />----------<br /><br />MORE DESIGN INSPIRATION<br />• Subscribe to H&amp;H's YouTube Channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/IZae51">https://goo.gl/IZae51</a><br />• Beautiful photo galleries <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://houseandhome.com/galleries/">https://houseandhome.com/galleries/</a><br /><br />----------<br /><br />CONNECT WITH HOUSE &amp; HOME!<br />• Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/houseandhomemagazine/">https://facebook.com/houseandhomemagazine/</a><br />• Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/houseandhomemag/">https://instagram.com/houseandhomemag/</a><br />• Pinterest <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pinterest.com/houseandhome/">https://pinterest.com/houseandhome/</a><br />• Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/HouseandHome">https://twitter.com/HouseandHome</a>{% endraw %}
