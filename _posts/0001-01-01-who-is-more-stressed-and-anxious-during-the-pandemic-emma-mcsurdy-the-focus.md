{% raw %}The focus of this research was the effects COVID-19 had on stress and anxiety levels in extroverts and introverts. Twenty-three individuals participated in this study and completed a survey online about their stress and anxiety levels before and after the pandemic. The results of the paired sample t-test showed significance in that stress scores after the COVID-19 pandemic were higher than before the pandemic. The repeated measures ANOVA resulted in significance in that anxiety scores after the pandemic were higher than before the pandemic. The results were consistent with the hypothesis that stress and anxiety levels would be higher after the COVID-19 pandemic. These findings call attention on the fact that peopleâ€™s mental health is suffering because of the COVID-19 pandemic. This realization can help people to seek professional help for their mental health.{% endraw %}
