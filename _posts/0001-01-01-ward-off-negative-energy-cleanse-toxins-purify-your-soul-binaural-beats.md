Listening to this music which is composed of this frequency (444 Hz) helps to get rid of all negative energy from mind, body, and soul. It gives you a sense of security and helps you to have a peaceful life.<br /><br />🔆(Note: To experience the best sound, Use a pair of headphones. Listen to this music in a quiet place for at least 20 / 25 minutes daily &quot;If Possible&quot;. If you are a beginner then don't try to fit too much at once)<br /><br />🔆 Are there any side effects of listening to our music?<br /><br />This question has been asked frequently by our subscribers. So, here is the answer. There aren't any side effects of listening to our music. But we suggest the sound level coming through your headphones shouldn't be set too high, otherwise, it can cause hearing loss. It could also be a problem if you have epilepsy, so before trying it, you should speak to your doctor.<br /><br />Love From Good Vibes❤<br />#goodvibesofficial #wardoffnegativeenergy #binauralbeats #cleansetoxins #purifyyoursoul<br /><br />PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO OUR CHANNEL &amp; Click the bell icon (🔔) to get the notification of regular updates...<br /><br />Download our app to listen to our music offline<br /> 📱Download Android App: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2Fk1qAe">http://bit.ly/2Fk1qAe</a><br /> 📱Download Our IOS APP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apple.co/2Vvk0A1">https://apple.co/2Vvk0A1</a><br /><br />Connect with Us<br />    Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2yGkp8x">https://bit.ly/2yGkp8x</a><br />    Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/34hH4DK">https://bit.ly/34hH4DK</a><br />    Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3c480tp">https://bit.ly/3c480tp</a><br /><br />The elements used in this video are licensed from, Videoblocks, Freepik, and have been re-edited by us.<br /><br />© Good Vibes all rights reserved.{% endraw %}
