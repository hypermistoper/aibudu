{% raw %}ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi has dismissed Mathira MP Rigathi Gachagua's remarks that he will not be picked as Deputy President William Ruto's running mate.<br /><br />In a statement on Monday,  Mudavadi, through his Secretary-general Simon Gikuru, said Gachagua has no powers to speak for their Kenya Kwanza Alliance.<br /><br />&quot;Rigathi Gachagua has no authority to speak for Kenya Kwanza on the matter hence his sentiments are premature, untimely and unwarranted, &quot; he said.<br /><br />Mudavadi added that the alliance has not decided on its presidential and running mate candidates.<br /><br />&quot;This will happen and be unveiled at an appropriate time by our principals Musalia, Ruto and Moses Wetangula.&quot;<br /><br />On Monday morning, at an interview with Citizen TV,  the Mathira MP said Rutoâ€™s running mate will come from the Mt Kenya region and the deal was already sealed.<br /><br />Gachagua said the ANC party leader was privy to the fact before joining the Ruto camp.<br /><br />&quot;When they came for discussion we were very fort-right because we are honest people. They were told that we agreed that running mate is from the mountain (Mt Kenya region),&quot; he said.<br /><br />&quot;We don't want to con someone. They will not be running mates.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Gachagua said the UDA party will unveil Ruto as their presidential candidate on March 15.<br /><br />&quot;We have our NDC on March 15 to unveil our candidate William Ruto and other things will follow,&quot; he said.<br /><br /><br />&quot;But as far as I'm concerned Ruto is a presidential candidate and the running mate will come from the mountain at an appropriate time.&quot;<br /><br /><br />Welcome to Bahari News Kenya.
