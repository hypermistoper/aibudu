{% raw %}From the album: 'Turn on the sun'  - 1970<br /><br /><br />The wind blows chilly, my bag is empty<br />The road runs narrow and it's full of holes<br />I've seen fine cities, and fields of plenty<br />But none so lovely as the ones at home<br /><br />And home is far, far across the ocean<br />My house is nothing more, now, than a song<br />Oh, come kind brothers, and sing a song for me<br />It's been a long long time that I've been gone<br /><br />I've traveled here and I traveled yonder<br />I've journeyed far and wide and up and down<br />But still the pathway is love to wander<br />Winds down the starry field to my hometown<br /><br />My friends are far, far across the ocean<br />If they've forgotten me, It's only fair<br />Oh come, kind brothers, we'll send the dove to them<br />And we will drink good health to them and theirs<br /><br />The wind blows chilly, my bag is empty<br />Though fortune smiled at me a time or so<br />There's no denying she's a fine lady<br />It's your own doing if you let her go<br /><br />And free's the grass and sweet grows the jasmine<br />Though hard times often last a lenghty spell<br />The sky is light now, the morning's risen<br />Oh, come, kind brothers, now, bid me farewell<br />Oh, come, kind brothers, now, bid me farewell{% endraw %}
