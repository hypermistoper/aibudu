{% raw %}Here's the article about Slave I:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thedirect.com/article/boba-fett-ship-name-change">https://thedirect.com/article/boba-fett-ship-name-change</a>  <br /><br />As for the Lucrehulk, what can I say?  I get the rationale for using an existing spaceframe as the basis for your combat vehicles, but sometimes it just doesn't work out that well.  Apparently these were reasonably effective, but that's only because almost every other capital ship in the Star Wars universe is larger, steamier pile of suck and fail.  <br /><br />Also, we now have a Wikitubia presence, for what nothing that is worth!  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/Sacred_Cow_Shipyards">https://youtube.fandom.com/wiki/Sacred_Cow_Shipyards</a> <br /><br />Podcast duplicate feed:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://anchor.fm/sacred-cow-shipyards">https://anchor.fm/sacred-cow-shipyards</a> <br />Patreon:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/sacredcowshipyards">https://www.patreon.com/sacredcowshipyards</a><br />SubscribeStar:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.subscribestar.com/sacred-cow-shipyards">https://www.subscribestar.com/sacred-cow-shipyards</a><br />(Also, Patreon/SubscribeStar are your gateway to the Discord.)<br />Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SacredCowShipyards">https://www.facebook.com/SacredCowShipyards</a><br />Twitter:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/SCShipyards">https://twitter.com/SCShipyards</a><br />Reddit:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sacredcowshipyards/">https://www.reddit.com/r/sacredcowshipyards/</a>{% endraw %}
