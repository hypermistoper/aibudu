{% raw %}#lettinggoofyourwesternlifestyle #sellingallyourstuffandstartingover #yoursecondchanceinlife #thephilippines #thefilipinapea<br />Letting go of your western lifestyle can be traumatic, but many of you who intend to stay in the Philippines will be selling all your stuff and starting over - and you'll find it can be liberating.  But don't retire in the Philippines now - not until you've done your homework and research, and realized there are many things to consider when retiring in the Philippines.  Letting go of your stuff in the west to live in the east isn't as hard as you might thin, but ... can you do it?  Are you ready for a new life in the Philippines?<br /><br />👉My videos and the effort I put into them are 100% free for everyone to enjoy, and all I ask is that you leave a thumbs-up on any videos that you like and subscribe to my channel - I have never, and will never, ask you for anything else.
