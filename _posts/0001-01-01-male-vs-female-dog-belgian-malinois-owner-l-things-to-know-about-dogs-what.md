{% raw %}What dog is right for me? What should I get male or female? I hope my video will help you to understand what is right for you.<br />Males and Females they are so different. It's a different type of life style. I had Pitbull and German Shepherd males before and never females. I'm glad I have experience with my Belgian Malinois Ayva female.<br /><br />Instincts<br /><br />It is claimed that female dogs tend to make better personal guardians than males, due to maternal instincts, but all dogs are individuals. My Ayva is so protective in the house and outside, I can say more than any male dogs.<br /><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE OUR CHANNEL, LEAVE A COMMENT, SHARE IF YOU LIKE IT<br />INSTAGRAMM PAGE<br />@lenochka__burke<br />@malinois.ayva<br /><br />#Belgianmalinois #malinois #dogs #malevsfemale #protectiondog{% endraw %}
