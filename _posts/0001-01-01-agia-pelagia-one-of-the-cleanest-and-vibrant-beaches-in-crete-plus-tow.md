{% raw %}Once a traditional fishing village, Agia Pelagia is now known as a seaside resort. Its narrow beach, set in a protected bay, is filled with lounge chairs and is popular for jet skiing and scuba diving. Souvenir handicraft shops, beach bars, and seafood restaurants are scattered around the waterfront. Inland, whitewashed Ekklisia Agia Pelagia is a former monastery that dates back to the Venetian period.<br />#kreta #beaches #greece{% endraw %}
