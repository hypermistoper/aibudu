{% raw %}Bad news if you thought BMW might tone down the looks of its mega-grille cars for 2022: it's doubling down on the controversy, and the new 7 Series is possibly the most divisive yet. Leading the charge for BMW’s rival to the Mercedes S-class and Audi A8 is the all-electric i7, a 544 horsepower e-limo that also has the Tesla Model S and Lucid Air in its snouty sights. <br /><br />But whooshy performance and silent refinement are only part of the story here – the real action happens in the backs seats, with the fold-down Theatre Mode screen for the most cinema-like experience ever in a car. <br /><br />Join Top Gear magazine’s Ollie Kew for a thorough look around the controversial outside – and ultra-lux inside – of the new i7.<br /><br />Chapters <br />00:00 - 01:06 Intro<br />01:07 - 02:59 Looks<br />03:00 - 04:27 Battery and Performance <br />04:28 - 06:28 Rear Interior and Theatre Mode<br />06:29 - 06:56 BMW Rivals<br />06:57 - 08:47 Front Interior<br />08:48 - 09:27 Outro<br /><br />Subscribe to Top Gear for more videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear">http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear</a><br /><br />MORE ABOUT TOP GEAR:<br />Want to watch a bit of Top Gear on the internet?
