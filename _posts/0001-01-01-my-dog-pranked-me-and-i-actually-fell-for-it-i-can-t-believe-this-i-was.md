{% raw %}I can’t believe this. I was having a perfectly normal, peaceful day… until Skaya pranked me! Not only is she sassy, but she’s a real trickster too! 😅<br /><br />I guess I should have expected it… it is April Fools’ Day, after all! And after all the little tricks I’ve played on Skaya, it’s only fair that she get me back! That said, what many of you may not realize is that she’s always messing around with me off camera… so this was absolutely normal behavior for her!  😂<br /><br />Hope you enjoy this silly April Fools’ video! 💕<br /><br />And hey, maybe there’ll be more pranks in the future? 👀<br /><br /><br />☆TOP ITEMS FOR HUSKIES or DOGS☆ <br />Treats:<br />Chicken Breast Treats - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3nkRFqv">https://amzn.to/3nkRFqv</a><br />Beef Liver Treats - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3jLr6Ze">https://amzn.to/3jLr6Ze</a><br /><br />Brushes:<br />Dematting Dog Rake (Brush Comb) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3iHsuem">https://amzn.to/3iHsuem</a><br />Slicker Brush (Self-cleaning) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/33EZfEE">https://amzn.to/33EZfEE</a> <br /><br />Dealing with Pet Hair and Messes:<br />Lint Rollers (essential for clothes!) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3lmF1FI">https://amzn.to/3lmF1FI</a> <br />Stain and Odor remover - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/311UAuC">https://amzn.to/311UAuC</a> <br />Pet Hair Remover Roller (for carpets) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/33Dam0U">https://amzn.to/33Dam0U</a><br />Best Vacuum for Pet Hair - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3iKGkwh">https://amzn.to/3iKGkwh</a><br /><br />☆ COME SAY HI! ☆ <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/skaya.siberian">http://instagram.com/skaya.siberian</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tiktok.com/@skaya.siberian">http://tiktok.com/@skaya.siberian</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/skaya.siberian">http://facebook.com/skaya.siberian</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/skayasiberian">http://twitter.com/skayasiberian</a>  <br /><br />If you’re reading this, just know that Skaya loves you! ❤<br /><br />My Dog Pranked Me and I Actually Fell for It…<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: This video is NOT sponsored.
