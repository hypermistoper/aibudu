{% raw %}In this makeover, I transform a vintage hutch into a modern cane door cabinet, with MCM style legs and handles made from scratch.<br /><br />The hutch was split into two parts; the bottom half was refinished in charcoal black, and this video shows the process for the top half. Both were sold for a profit!<br /><br />If you enjoyed this makeover, please like and subscribe to see more. And if you have any questions, I would be happy to answer your comments. <br /><br />Thank you for watching :) <br /><br />- Andy from Modern Makeovers<br /><br />----------<br />Below is a list of the tools and products that I used. <br /><br />Cane (Canada only): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.levairscaningsupplies.ca/">https://www.levairscaningsupplies.ca/</a><br />Bondo Body Filler: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3bGhFZb">https://amzn.to/3bGhFZb</a> <br />Rustoleum Chalked Paint: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3f2wVlj">https://amzn.to/3f2wVlj</a><br />Zinsser Shellac: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3v3qBiR">https://amzn.to/3v3qBiR</a><br />Saman Wood Stain: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3hBzRqD">https://amzn.to/3hBzRqD</a><br />Elmer's Wood Filler (Natural): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3hFy7wS">https://amzn.to/3hFy7wS</a><br />Varathane Satin Floor Finish (Clear Satin): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3is36wq">https://amzn.to/3is36wq</a><br />Minwax Polyeurathane Spray (Clear Satin): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3eZa6Pw">https://amzn.to/3eZa6Pw</a><br />Kreg Pocket-Hole Jig: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2TBoBk8">https://amzn.to/2TBoBk8</a><br />California Air Compressor (15 gal): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3fuZK98">https://amzn.to/3fuZK98</a><br />Spray Gun Holder: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3cuH4Wn">https://amzn.to/3cuH4Wn</a><br /><br />As a disclaimer, the above links may be affiliate links, so if you make a purchase with the links provided, I may receive a small commission.
