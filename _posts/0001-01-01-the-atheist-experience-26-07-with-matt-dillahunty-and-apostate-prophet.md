The fact that something may have happened doesnâ€™t tell us why it happened.<br /><br />Next up is Aaron from FL who wants to know if telling those struggling with severe mental health issues that God wants them to live is a beneficial technique. One of main issues with this is that their reason for living is not tied to reality, and if their belief wavers they are back to where they started or worse.<br /><br />Next is Jacob from NJ who wants to pick a fight with Apostate Prophet. Is this relevant to the truth of Islam? No, it's petty and fallacious.<br /><br />Next is Joel who believes that the universe was created by God. Since no one has an evidence based explanation yet for the cause of the universe, any conclusion is premature and unfounded.<br /><br />Up next is Kerim from Turkey who is concerned about Turkish Muslims who give up the Hadiths in favor of only embracing the Quran. Without the Hadiths, the Quran becomes merely a compilation of secondary sources.<br /><br />Next is Rivalvo from Norway who presents a prophecy where Muhammad claims that a warrior wonâ€™t die in battle, and despite fighting in many, they didnâ€™t. Just because a prediction comes true, doesnâ€™t explain why it came true.<br /><br />Up next is Marlo from TX who discovered Sufism and believes that they had a supernaturally influenced spiritual experience. The caller unfortunately has no evidence that their conclusion is anything more than a feeling.<br /><br />Our final call of the day is Guy from GA who wants to ask if Muslims believe that only Allah can create life, or if they believe that humans may eventually become capable of doing so.<br /><br />WHAT IS THE ATHEIST EXPERIENCE?<br /><br />The Atheist Experience is a weekly call-in internet show in Austin, Texas geared at a non-atheist audience.
