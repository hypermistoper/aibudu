{% raw %}This record (that I wrote &amp; produced) is a feel good summation of what life has been over the last few months. I feel like dealing with adversity not only makes us stronger when dealing with negative things but can also help us appreciate the positive ones; even increasing our overall satisfaction with life. It’s allowed me to be more empathetic to others, build self efficacy, &amp; also reassess stress as more of a challenge to problem solve rather than be discouraged. The air feels fresher. Food has been tasting better. My skin has been glowing. The hard work has been paying off. The gratitude is real as fuck. The intention is sincere. The vision is clear. And the future feels very bright; as of recent.<br /><br />Stream &quot;As Of Recent&quot; 2-Pack On All Platforms: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://li.sten.to/asofrecent">https://li.sten.to/asofrecent</a><br /><br />Written &amp; Produced by Heno.<br />Mixed &amp; Mastered by Jose &quot;Soberseas&quot; Soberanes <br />Creative Director, Editor - Soberseas<br />Assistant Director - Luis &quot;Bubba&quot; Gutierrez<br />Stylist - Karim Ali c/o BadNews Design<br />Artist MGMT - Wesley Flores<br /><br />FOLLOW HENO.<br />WEBSITE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mynameisheno.com​">https://www.mynameisheno.com​</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mynameisheno​">https://twitter.com/mynameisheno​</a><br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mynameisheno">https://www.instagram.com/mynameisheno</a><br />FB: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/mynameisheno">https://www.facebook.com/mynameisheno</a><br /><br /><br />LYRICS<br /><br />As of recent<br />I don't associate if it ain't decent<br />I rather hold the weight than break into pieces<br />I been roaming states and making some ETH quick<br />Had to go away to shake the leeches<br />I control my faith with more than grace my soul awake but hate elitists <br />Got so many to thank for the way I stay eating<br />I got so many to thank for the (yeah, look)<br /><br />Just cuz we went to school together <br />Don’t mean that we’re cool forever<br />I'm on some new endeavors<br />Seeds planted in June bloomed in December<br />You can Google my efforts<br />So make some room when I enter<br />Feeling improved, even better<br />Than where I was in the past with a gun to my head<br />I was ducking the feds<br />Had some fumbled regrets<br />Now having fun collecting funds with no discussions <br />Told my brothers &quot;I’ll be done when Im dead&quot;, fuck what was said<br />Come from where staying inside <br />The same as you staying alive<br />I ain't glorifying it….<br />I ain't claiming no sides…<br />My city made me the villain these pictures painted in lies<br />This is my origin story <br />I'm breaking curses in my fam, hope for more of them surely<br />Some were laid in the dirt I learned bout remorse very early<br />Some got played in the game coming home in their 30s<br />What a shame such dismay seen what’s gorgeous turn dirty<br />I Pray the lord don't desert me<br /><br />But As of recent…<br />But As of recent<br />I don't associate if it ain't decent<br />I rather hold the weight than break into pieces<br />I been roaming states and making some ETH quick<br />Had to go away to shake the leeches<br />I control my faith with more than grace my soul awake but hate elitists <br />Got so many to thank for the way I stay eating<br /><br />That’s how I feel as of recent (2x){% endraw %}
