After supper, Mrs. Buxton showed Jocelyn to a room where she could be accommodated. The room was beautiful and comfortable, but in the corridor in front of the door Jocelyn saw a wooden staircase that led to the top, she asked: &quot;Tell me, please, where does this staircase lead?&quot; “This staircase leads to the attic, there is another room. My daughter Bridget used to like to spend time in it. She often climbed up there, made tea for herself, and read books. She loves to read,” Mrs. Buxton answered. &quot;Where is your daughter now?&quot; asked Jocelyn. - &quot;She is already an adult, 8 years ago she met her love, her future husband, and moved to live with him in Spain. They already have 3 children, and when there is such an opportunity, they come to visit us with their whole friendly and happy family.&quot; said Mrs Buxton. &quot;What a touching story! In the name of love, your daughter Bridget did such a brave thing, she decided to move to another country. This deserves respect!&quot; - Said Jocelyn. - &quot;Yes, such an act really deserves respect. Jocelyn, if you want, you can spend the night in this room in the attic. I did not initially suggest this to you because I thought it would not be polite to offer the guest to sleep in the attic!&quot; After the last words of Mrs. Buxton and Jocelyn laughed together. &quot;I'd really like to stay in this room if you don't mind, I've never slept in an attic before.&quot; Jocelyn climbed up the old wooden stairs and saw a very beautiful and comfortable room. Here she felt like the heroine of a fairy tale. The atmosphere of this room was just magical, it was very warm here as the fireplace warmed the room well. There was a beautiful view of the forest outside the window, and the sounds of a blizzard, combined with the sounds of a fireplace, created a feeling of comfort and safety. Jocelyn lay down on the bed, and a few minutes later fell asleep sweetly... &quot;<br />First part of the story: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/y3o5i9caP4g">https://youtu.be/y3o5i9caP4g</a><br /><br />Share this video with your friends and family.
