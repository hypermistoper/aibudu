{% raw %}We kick off the new season of A Cook's Tour with a trip to southeast Asia. Expect fresh flavours, a bit of heat, and a wealth of culinary knowledge of the region from this rising star, Chef John Chantarasak. Participants will learn about the unique cuisine of Northern Thailand, home to a plethora of dishes seldom known outside of their domestic homeland, hone new skills like how to perfectly balance sweetness and spice, and discover special ingredients such as makrut lime leaves. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://acookstour.co.uk/discover-northern-thailand-with-john-chantarasak/">https://acookstour.co.uk/discover-northern-thailand-with-john-chantarasak/</a>{% endraw %}
