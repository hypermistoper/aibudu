{% raw %}The universe operates with the decorative design of algorithms because systems from biology, physics, computer science and neuroscience can have the same architecture or processes.<br />Algorithms follow steps, even if the steps are exponential it cannot deviate from the process. <br />Earth started off as water, carbon and energy that went through processes and evolved into life as we know it.<br />So what is the difference between life as a process and being alive?<br />Algorithms cannot feel the warm embrace of inspiration or recognize truth.<br />Things that run off algorithms cannot predict by itself if it will go into an infinite loop, but the universe is different. <br />Scientists are proving that the universe is always learning, it does not only follow steps and processes, it can adapt, model, predict and evolve.<br />D Morgan said“The road you choose to travel means the difference in the dance” <br />Discovery is a gift of truth from the universe explaining itself and the difference between information and discovery is perspective.<br />Perspective is the gift of sight from the mind giving vision that leads to understanding.<br />All things are temporary but that which is eternal and that which is eternal evolves{% endraw %}
