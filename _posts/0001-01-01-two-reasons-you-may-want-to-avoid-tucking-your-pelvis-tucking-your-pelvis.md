{% raw %}Tucking your pelvis does not actually protect your spine, in fact it could be hurting your spine. Our spines form secondary curves when we are infants because they must adapt to be weight-bearing and function with us standing upright... our spines do not stay flat, as they are when we are born, to protect us... please don’t fight against your spines natural curves by tucking your pelvis🙏<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sterlingstructuraltherapy.com/sterling-method/">https://sterlingstructuraltherapy.com/sterling-method/</a>{% endraw %}
