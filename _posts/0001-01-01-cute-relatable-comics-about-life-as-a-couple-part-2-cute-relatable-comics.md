{% raw %}Cute Relatable Comics About Life As A Couple (Part 2)<br /><br />Everyone's significant other is unique, but that doesn't mean that people don't have similar experiences when in a relationship. It's good to realize how your relationship is special, but it's also good to realize that you're not the only couple doing their own thing: actually, in some sense, it is even therapeutic to realize you're not the only &quot;crazy&quot; couple out there, and in fact, the &quot;bizarre&quot; things that you love to do are actually pretty normal.<br /><br />Which is why we may thank Anjali Srivastava for making comics that reflect the everyday life and the relationships with your partner in a very relatable way. Without further ado, let me introduce to you &quot;Anjali Comics&quot;!<br />✅More info: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/anjali_comics/">https://www.instagram.com/anjali_comics/</a><br />✅ I do not own the image or the music in my video.
