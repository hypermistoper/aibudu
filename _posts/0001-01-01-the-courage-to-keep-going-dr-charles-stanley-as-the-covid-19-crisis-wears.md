{% raw %}As the COVID-19 crisis wears on and continues to interrupt our lives, it’s easy to become discouraged and want to give up. But as a believer, you have God’s presence to lead and sustain you through your difficulties. In Part 4 of the &quot;The Courage to Stand&quot; series, Dr. Stanley points you to key biblical principles that can give you the boldness and courage to press on.<br /><br />This sermon was recorded before COVID-19. For the protection of our staff members and the community, we are currently following safety guidelines by practicing social distancing. We appreciate your understanding.<br /><br />For more messages from Charles Stanley, including this week's broadcast, go to intouch.org/tv.{% endraw %}
