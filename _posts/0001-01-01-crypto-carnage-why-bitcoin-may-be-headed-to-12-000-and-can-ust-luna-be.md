{% raw %}&quot;Bitcoin shining during inflation was always a myth,&quot; claims Gareth Soloway, president and CFO of InTheMoneyStocks.com. He tells our Daniela Cambone that Bitcoin has never experienced an era without quantitative easing stemming from the Fed, and has a $20,000 high-end and a $12,000 low-end target for the digital asset. &quot;Terra's collapse was insane,&quot; Soloway exclaims, saying that it will be very hard for it to bounce back significantly since they keep minting, &quot;more and more coins.&quot; Soloway asserts that bitcoin is still viewed as, &quot;digital gold,&quot; but the precious metal gold is a very mature asset in comparison. &quot;Even after a pretty dramatic pullback recently, gold is still having a positive year,&quot; he states when comparing the safe haven to other forms of stored wealth. &quot;Gold should start its next leg up soon,&quot; he predicts, as the precious metal saw a downturn over the weekend. He concludes that we are in a &quot;Fed-induced bear market, with a recession coming later in 2022,&quot; so it's important to be a nimble investor.<br /><br />⭐️  Try Stansberry Research FREE for 7 days.
