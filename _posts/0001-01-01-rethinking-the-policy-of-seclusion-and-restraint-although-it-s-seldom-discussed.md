{% raw %}Although it’s seldom discussed, the policy of seclusion and restraint is applied throughout the American education system. Should school officials deem it necessary, they can isolate students alone in locked rooms or restrain them.<br /><br />But rather than safely deescalating agitated children, these interventions are deeply traumatizing.<br /><br />Join Mona Delahooke, therapist and author of Beyond Behaviors, and Guy Stephens, founder and director of the Alliance Against Seclusion and Restraint, for a discussion about alternative methods for working with neurodivergent kids who are seen as misbehaving.<br /><br />This conversation is a can’t miss for clinicians who work with children, caregivers, and educators. You’ll discover an alternative way of looking at behaviors: one that centralizes a child’s need and provides the support needed even during the most challenging outbursts.{% endraw %}
