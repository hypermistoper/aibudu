I'm Alebrazil! Nice to meet you. I'm a 14 year old Male Hypixel/Lunar content creator! Nice to meet you! Hopefully you do enjoy my content and do stick around for more in the future. Below there will be some fun facts about me and also some frequently asked questions! If you wanna talk to me or have anything you wanna ask me, please do join my discord server. (which is in the top of the description!) <br /><br />üåä Fun Facts<br /><br />1Ô∏è‚É£ - I have one of the highest amount of Hypixel leaderboards. Some include #1 in 2v2v2v2 Bridge, #3 in Grinch Simulator and #9 in Halloween Simulator.<br />2Ô∏è‚É£ - I love coffee. Like REALLY love coffee. A lot. And cats too! :3<br />3Ô∏è‚É£ - I love Hypixel &amp; Lunar client, but you probably could guess from above! :p<br /><br />00:00 - 00:25 - Hypixel News<br />00:25 - 00:40 -  @Armegon 30k &amp; Pack<br />00:40 - 01:00 -  @Infernally YT Rank<br />01:00 - 01:33 - Stranded Skyblock<br />01:33 - 02:15 -  @James Charles and @Wemmbu<br /><br />‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions:<br /><br />1 - What is &quot;Rock Collecting Club&quot;?<br /> - It is a group channel i made with some of my friends!<br />2 - How old are you?<br /> - I am 14 years old as of right now.<br />3 - Are you a boy or a girl?<br /> - I am a boy.<br />4 - Do you duel?<br /> - I don't duel. A lot of people try to &quot;flex&quot; beating me but I'm actually really bad. Even if you might not do that, I am just insecure and don't duel.<br />5 - Do you friend on Hypixel, discord or follow on Twitter?<br /> - If I don't know you, no. Even if I know you I might not friend/follow, sorry!<br />6 - Will you play with me?<br /> - Probably not, I am very picky with who I play with and shy as well, sorry!<br /><br />üíò It should go without saying, but Lego Maestro and I do not have anything against each other. After speaking to Lego a bit after his response video, I am happy to say that there is no &quot;drama&quot; between me and Lego, and never has been. I do wanna thank Lego for reaching out to me however, as it gave me a much better perspective on everything.<br /><br />üíû Hey! You've made it to the end of the description!<br />#hypixel #hypixelnews #minecraft{% endraw %}
