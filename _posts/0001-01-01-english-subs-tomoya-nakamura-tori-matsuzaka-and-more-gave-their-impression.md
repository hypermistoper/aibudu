{% raw %}#HajiKoi #YokohamaRyusei #RyuseiYokohama<br /><br />[ZIP, 06.07.2019]<br />Ryusei Yokohama served as ZIP's Friday Personality in June 2019. This episode also showed his impact right after HajiKoi. In addition, four senior co-stars gave their impression of Ryusei-kun.<br /><br />Credits to 小哲丨瀚瀚 for the video. Link to his/her profile here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://space.bilibili.com/1415711">https://space.bilibili.com/1415711</a><br /><br />PS. Been working on this video for months. It's only now that I was able to finish it 🙈 Hopefully I could translate other videos that I previously wasn't confident of translating as well. After all, good things (like learning) take time. 💞<br /><br />++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />Disclaimer: Please take note that the translations aren't 100% accurate. Also, normally, I could only translate those with Japanese texts. If you found any errors / corrections, feel free to reach out : )<br /><br />More interviews and translations in my blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://watadoucouple.wordpress.com">http://watadoucouple.wordpress.com</a>{% endraw %}
