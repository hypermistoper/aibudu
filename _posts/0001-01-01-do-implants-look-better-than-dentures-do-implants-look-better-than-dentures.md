{% raw %}Do implants look better than dentures? No! Removable dentures can be made to look just as attractive as dental implants. My current Hybrid Denture, which is just a type of denture that screws into implants, has Ivoclar Vivadent's Phones II teeth in them. These teeth can also be used in a fully removable denture. So if implants are a long term goal that you're not quite ready for just yet (implants are expensive!), you can still have achieve beautiful results with a removable denture! <br /><br />This video is sponsored by Ivoclar Vivadent.
