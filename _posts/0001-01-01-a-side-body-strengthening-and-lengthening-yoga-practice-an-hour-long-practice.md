{% raw %}An hour long practice targeting your obliques and the deep core, alongside lengthening the side body and creating some space in the ribs, lats, and QL (lower back). Props needed: You may like to have a pair of blocks, and if knees get tender in low lunging and knees-down positions, have a blanket or some extra cushioning available. Vinyasas optional- I am 6 months pregnant and keep it mellow with cat/cows to neutralize the spine between sequences. Enjoy!{% endraw %}
