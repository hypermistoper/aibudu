{% raw %}LYRICS:<br /><br />Fuck off you fuck your violent threats your attempts to control the nation<br />Fuck off you fucked up fascist cunt, understand the situation<br />Back off you slimy worthless prick, you ain't got a clue what you are facing<br />Eat bricks you het up bastard shits, scabs; you'll get what you are creating<br />Who the fuck do you think you're pushing, &quot;stay in place or get it&quot;<br />I would think again to save your skin, because if you come too close you'll fucking regret it<br />You whine on all the hell you like, repeat your warnings of plastic bullets<br />The gas, the batons, the water cannon -the more you oppress the more we will resist<br /><br />Riots, there ain't been a riot, but one's knocking at your door<br />You have seen nothing yet but household pets but you'll soon feel the lion's claws<br />Proclaiming laws last victory, of containing rebel shower<br />When the time is right you'll get the fight that will totally test your power<br />Inciting, provoking trouble that you know can easily be beaten<br />To maintain the image that we need you, so thus re-confirm your position<br />You might trick some you scheming scum, but you'll never get our obedience<br />You can batter, beat us, even imprison us, yet still you will never ever never defeat us<br /><br />Belfast...Brixton...Toxteth...Tottenham...St Paul's...Handsworth...<br />Reclaim the streets, reclaim the towns, reclaim the nation<br /><br />What revolution? This revolution, we all wanted a peaceful solution<br />But this institution, that institution, smashed all hope of getting through to them<br />Confrontations, escalating violations of the law<br />Repercussions of the mass destruction which in the end is sure<br />To mean them pumping out the bullets, their protection from the poor<br />We will win because we have to; we ain't got nothing to loose no more<br />And what they lose they undoubtedly will forfeit forever<br />&quot;They've got the guns, but we've got the numbers&quot;<br />And we give no apologies ever!{% endraw %}
