{% raw %}Often, we dream too faraway to appreciate what is in our own backyard. The simplest way to explore is to look around you. Mobilized by this philosophy and the sensory experience of snowboarding, Patagonia ambassador Nicholas Wolken spent the past two seasons enjoying what nature had to offer only a train ride away from the town where he grew up. The result is Close to Home. The eight-minute short follows Nicholas and fellow Patagonia ambassador Forrest Shearer as they stay in a family friend’s alpine hut in Fideriser Heuberge and surrender to simplicity. As Nicholas puts it, “In snowboarding, less is more.”{% endraw %}
