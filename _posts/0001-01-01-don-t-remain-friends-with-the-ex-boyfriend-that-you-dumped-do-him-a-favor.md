It only makes it harder for them to get over you.<br /><br />Sure, you want to keep them as friends because they might be awesome people, but that's just selfish on your part. You're only thinking about your own needs. You fail to notice that if you stay friends with an ex, it makes it harder for them to get over you. <br /><br />They may act like they want to stay friends, but they only do it with the off-chance of getting back with you. If you don't believe me, then you might just be a little naive about how things work.<br /><br />This is being demoted from boyfriend to the friend zone and trust me, it's something that's not worth it. <br /><br />Some women stay friends with an ex because they're not sure about their decision, and that means that you're just thinking about yourself and that you're sabotaging your next relationship. <br /><br />Here's what you have to do: break it off. Implement the no contact rule. Delete the guy from all your social media, and phone and don't let him contact you no matter how much he begs. He needs the time to heal. IF he gets any form of attention from you, he's going to take it as a sign and it might encourage him to pursue. Don't give him the time of day and dump him completely. This will help him get over you because he might move on to the next girl. Yes, he might move on.<br /><br />Here's a link to the article version: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mindfulattraction.org/blog/2019/8/3/dont-remain-friends-with-the-ex-boyfriend-that-you-dumped-do-him-a-favor-amp-go-no-contact-forever">https://mindfulattraction.org/blog/2019/8/3/dont-remain-friends-with-the-ex-boyfriend-that-you-dumped-do-him-a-favor-amp-go-no-contact-forever</a><br /><br />Check out my course on The Psychological Game of Attraction so youâ€™ll learn how to get a guy to love you from start to finish. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dalexis-school.thinkific.com/courses/the-dark-arts-of-attraction">https://dalexis-school.thinkific.com/courses/the-dark-arts-of-attraction</a><br /><br />JOIN MY FB GROUP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/mindfulattraction20">https://www.facebook.com/groups/mindfulattraction20</a><br />Follow me on twitter for updates: Twitter.com/dalexispe<br />Follow me on instagram: @dalexisp{% endraw %}
