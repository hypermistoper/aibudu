{% raw %}have | have got | got | gotta | English grammar<br /><br />Hi Everyone! <br /><br />In this lesson, we are going to look at some grammar which I think is pretty...special. Why is this grammar so special? Because there are 3 different ways to say the same thing. Yes, one of the forms is incorrect, but you WILL hear native English speakers using it. <br /><br />Can you give me any examples using today's grammar in the comments below? What's something you HAVE TO do later? <br /><br />üî•You might like these other video lessons on other confusing verbs/phrases: <br /><br />‚úÖLOOK SEE WATCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ccgOiXzD0Tc">https://youtu.be/ccgOiXzD0Tc</a><br />‚úÖLIKE, LIKELY, UNLIKE, LIKELIHOOD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/omrDFwGbpSc">https://youtu.be/omrDFwGbpSc</a><br />‚úÖBECAUSE, AS, SINCE, FOR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/T2Y6Js_52Rk">https://youtu.be/T2Y6Js_52Rk</a><br />‚úÖEITHER vs. NEITHER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/w81zxKdz4Ns">https://youtu.be/w81zxKdz4Ns</a><br /><br />üî•OR visit my blogpost to read more about this topic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://arnelseverydayenglish.com/i-have-vs-i-have-got-vs-i-got-vs-i-gotta-english-grammar-lesson-with-video/">https://arnelseverydayenglish.com/i-have-vs-i-have-got-vs-i-got-vs-i-gotta-english-grammar-lesson-with-video/</a><br /><br />üöÄIf you SUBSCRIBE to my channel and turn on those NOTIFICATIONS, you'll never miss a lesson. <br /><br />Would you like to SUPPORT my channel?  ‚òïÔ∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/arnel">https://ko-fi.com/arnel</a><br />(a big THANK YOU to all of you who have supported me ü•∞.
