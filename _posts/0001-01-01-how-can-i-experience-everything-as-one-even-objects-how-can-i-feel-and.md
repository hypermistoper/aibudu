{% raw %}How can I feel and experience everything as one, or see God's presence in everything? The woman who asks this can feel the being in herself, but asks how can she also see it in animals and even objects like a pen? Rupert guides the woman to experiencing the feeling of oneness with everyone and everything. <br /><br />The idea that our being is finite is just a belief. And this belief – that we are individual, separate beings – is what causes all the pain, suffering, hostility and judgement in the world. <br /><br />Seeing the unity of being in all people, animals and objects, or one infinite being, is the understanding that can change the world. <br /><br />This clip is taken from one of Rupert's Online Retreats at Home from 6-10 November, 2020.<br /><br />––<br /><br />ACCESS FULL VIDEO ARCHIVE <br />You can watch or listen to 1000s of hours of teachings, guided meditations and answers in Rupert's full video archive here: <br />▸ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rupertspira.com/subscriptions">https://rupertspira.com/subscriptions</a><br /><br />––<br /><br />RETREATS <br />Rupert holds regular retreats, roughly once per month, both in-person and online.
