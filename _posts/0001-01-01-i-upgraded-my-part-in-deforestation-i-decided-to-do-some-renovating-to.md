{% raw %}I decided to do some renovating to my Deforestation part from 2020, one of my first collab parts I ever built, but also one of my most beloved. I wanted to do this part justice because I love it so much. Most of it had terrible structuring, block design, and ground spikes, so I refurbished those aspects. Hopefully yall like it more and we can hope to see this level out in the very near future!<br /><br />MAIN CHANNEL: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ZhM0fDxU9bqqlwWRMHwuw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3ZhM0fDxU9bqqlwWRMHwuw</a>{% endraw %}
