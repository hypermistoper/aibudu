From the wild west days of “download brand new games from direct links on this website, no one will care!” to the modern day mindset of “if you play 6 seconds of a clip of our song in your YouTube we'll pursue legal action!”, there MUST be a happy medium. If there is, Eric Clapton's not going to be the one to find it, as he and his legal team sued a 50 year old German woman who was trying to sell ONE single CD on eBay that her late husband bought in the 80s. Buckley looks at the insanity of this case, the aftermath, and the history of companies deciding to go after individuals for ridiculous amounts of money instead of trying to solve the real issue.<br /><br />#Music #Copyright{% endraw %}
