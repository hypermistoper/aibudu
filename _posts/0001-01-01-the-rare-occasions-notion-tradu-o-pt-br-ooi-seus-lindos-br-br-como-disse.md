{% raw %}ooi seus lindos<br /><br />como disse no outro vídeo, vou tentar trazer vídeos regularmente. Então é provável que poste um dia sim e um dia não. Vou atualizando vocês conforme precise.<br /><br />Estou aceitando sujestões de músicas, podem me mandar no Instagram ou aqui mesmo, e vou estar fazendo enquetes de músicas para vocês votarem.<br /><br />•Ig: starvkkj<br />obrigado:))<br /><br />Lyrics<br /><br />Sure it's a calming notion, perpetual in motion<br />But I don't need the comfort of any lies<br />For I have seen the ending and there is no ascending<br />Rise<br /><br />Oh back when I was younger, was told by other youngsters<br />That my end will be torture beneath the earth<br />'Cuz I don't see what they see, when death is staring at me<br />I see a window, a limit, to live it, or not at all<br /><br />If you could pull the lever to carry on forever<br />Would your life even matter anymore?<br />Sure it's a calming notion, perpetual in motion<br />But it's not what you signed up for<br /><br />I'm sure there won't always be sunshine<br />But there's this momentary beam of light<br />You don't have to wait those salty decades<br />To get through the gate it's all in front of your face<br /><br />I'm sure there won't always be sunshine<br />I'm sure there won't always be sunshine<br />But there's this momentary beam of light<br /><br />I could cross the ocean in a fit of devotion<br />For every shining second this fragile body beckons<br />You think you're owed it better believing ancient letters<br />Sure it's a calming notion but it's a lie{% endraw %}
