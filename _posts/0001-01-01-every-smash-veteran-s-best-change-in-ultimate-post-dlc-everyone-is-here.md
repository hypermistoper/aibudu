{% raw %}Everyone is here! But...not quite how they used to be. Super Smash Bros. Ultimate brought back every character in Smash history, from Smash 64 to Melee to Brawl to Smash 4, which meant decades of designs that all needed to be adapted for the new game engine. I originally looked at the best change for each character over on MockRock when the game was brand new, and now that the balance patches are all done, it's time to take a retrospective look back at how those changes panned out.<br /><br />______________________________________________<br /><br />Main channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/mockrocktv">https://www.youtube.com/mockrocktv</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MrMockRock​">https://twitter.com/MrMockRock​</a><br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/mockrock​">https://www.patreon.com/mockrock​</a><br /><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/mockrocktwitch​">https://www.twitch.tv/mockrocktwitch​</a><br /><br />Business email: MockRock@inf1uence.com<br /><br />Teespring: teespring.com/stores/mockrock<br /><br />______________________________________________<br /><br />TimeBolt: I used TimeBolt on this video to massively increase the speed of editing, it's a program that essentially creates your jump cuts for you.
