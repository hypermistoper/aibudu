{% raw %}J. Krishnamurti - Washington DC 1985 - Public Talk 1 - In the present is the whole of time<br /><br />Summary:<br /><br />Why are we, after this long evolution, perpetually in conflict?<br /><br />Being absorbed in a poem, a face, is that beauty?<br /><br />Why has humanity, each one of us, accepted fear as a way of life?<br /><br />Why do we live, act on the basis of thought? What is the relationship to time of thought?<br /><br />Can there be total mutation now, in all our behaviour, way of living, thinking, feeling?<br /><br />If you had no memory at all, could you think?<br /><br />Memory arises from knowledge, experience. Is experience different from the experiencer? If there is no experiencer, is there experience?<br /><br />---<br /><br />This channel is managed by the Krishnamurti Foundation Trust​​, UK​, and by the Krishnamurti Foundation of America.<br /><br />The role of the foundations was described by Krishnamurti when he said,​ ​'The foundations will see to it that these teachings are kept whole, are not distorted, are not made corrupt. They will not give rise to any sectarian spirit in their activities... nor create any kind of place of worship around the teachings or the person.​'​<br /><br />We maintain extensive archives of Krishnamurti's original works and all four Krishnamurti foundations are actively engaged in the publication of material in various forms.<br /><br />Our videos contain thousands of subtitles in more than 25 languages, translated by volunteers from all over the world. If you would like to help us with translating subtitles, please contact us at digital@kfoundation.org<br /><br />For more information about J.
