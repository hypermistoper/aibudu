{% raw %}The biggest day of the week, THE FINAL. Didn't quite have the practice I wanted, made a few silly mistakes which I hoped to fix in the final but sadly that was all taken away from me with a stupid flat tire. Absolutely gutted to get one at this UCI Downhill World Cup, felt happy on the bike and really wanted that sub 3 minute time but it sadly wasn't to be. Just gotta try at the next one and show everyone that I've still got the skill at my wise old age. <br /><br />Watching the final from the bottom was insane, the top boys putting out insane times and all so insanely close to each other, was an awesome watch. Loved every second of being back on the World Cup circuit and can't wait for the next one already.{% endraw %}
