{% raw %}A #Narcissist Explains- How you end up chasing after a narcissist. The changing relationship dynamic of being with a narcissist. This is after the love bombing or idealization stage of a narcissistic relationship<br /><br />If this is your first video, my name is Lee and I am a self aware narcissist. I've been in therapy for my personality disorder since 2017 and it has definitely changed my life because without it, I would have lost everything. <br /><br />The point of these videos is to help bring awareness from the other side of the narcissistic abuse spectrum. All my videos give perspective on why many narcissists do what they do and the possible different reasons behind them. The abuse victims get validation and the Narcissists (those that are willing) get to see that you can get help and that you are not alone. <br /><br />1 on 1's and all my links - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://beacons.page/mentalhealness">https://beacons.page/mentalhealness</a> <br /><br />You can find me on <br /><br />Tiktok MentalHealness - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mentalhealness?lang=en">https://www.tiktok.com/@mentalhealness?lang=en</a><br />Insta- Mentalhealnesss - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mentalhealnesss/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/mentalhealnesss/?hl=en</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MentalHealness85">https://www.facebook.com/MentalHealness85</a><br /><br />For more detailed videos find me on www.wisio.com search mental healness.
