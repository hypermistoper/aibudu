{% raw %}Andrew Haaheim teaches general and college level biology at Fridley High School. In addition, he is a musician and performs improv comedy in the Twin Cities area.<br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
