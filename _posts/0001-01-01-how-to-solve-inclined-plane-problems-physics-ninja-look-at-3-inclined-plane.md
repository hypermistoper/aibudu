{% raw %}Physics Ninja look at 3 inclined plane problems.   1)  Determine the speed at the bottom of the ramp and the time is takes to get to the bottom.   2)   Given an initial speed up the ramp find the max distance up the ramp (includes kinetic friction) 3)    Find the tension in the rope if the block is in equilibrium.{% endraw %}
