{% raw %}I actually know how to make a pretty good looking gift basket for Christmas, a New Baby, Birthdays, Thank You's and other gift giving events. I've actually made 100's and they're great as gifts but also as give away's to charities, golf tournaments &amp; other fund raising events in silent auctions. My first gift basket story will explain how I started making these beautiful gift baskets. It's a craft but also a labor of love. Filled with chocolates &amp; other items they are sure to please one or many in an office, family or group. Although this channel has viewers over 50 this DIY video on how to make gift baskets could appeal to men or women in their twenties, thirties or forties too. I find that making these can save you money if you're on a budget and need to give gifts that impress. They'll be a one-of-a-kind gift and even more special because they were made by YOU!<br /><br />By the way...
