{% raw %}Is your office space encroaching on your chill space? Is it taking over your room or dining room? Does the mere sight of all your work make you feel stressed? Simply close the door on it, take a deep breath and relax.<br /><br />Milestone Kitchens’ newest venture, the Office in a Cupboard or KINK (Kantoor in ‘n Kas), is the perfect solution for you. Keep all your work and office paraphernalia in a neat, compact cupboard so that when you need a break or are done for the day, all you need to do is stand up, tuck your chair in and close your KINK doors. Out of sight, out of mind.<br /><br />Houses and apartments are becoming smaller, people are working from home more and more and thus the need to have an elegant, compact solution to your office space is becoming more pressing. Hence, our Office in a Cupboard concept was born.<br /><br />The KINK has just the right amount of space required for a productive work environment, whether you are a student, work from home or often need to take your work home with you. The ergonomical desk design allows for an eye level screen, it has plenty of shelving designed for textbooks, files, paper and even the ever necessary tea pot. There is a slide out shelf for a printer, drawers for your stationary, important papers or that sneaky slab of chocolate you need to keep you going. We know how annoying it can be when there are cables all over your desk, so we have also included a cable hole in the desk to keep them out of your way. <br /><br />Then, when your friends arrive for a drink or you want to have a clutter free dining room table for a lovely meal with your loved ones or you simply want to go to sleep without having to stare at your pile of unfinished work, simply fold up the extra desk space, tuck your chair and close the cupboard doors.<br /><br />Milestone Kitchens Office in a Cupboard’s dimensions are 1200mm wide x 650mm high x 2100mm high. It is available in all three of our ranges, the African Allure, French Flair and Swedish Style in their standard colours or as a customised unit to suit your space and colour scheme.<br /><br />Order your Office in a Cupboard today: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.milestonekitchens.co.za/2.Contact-Milestone-Kitchens.htm">https://www.milestonekitchens.co.za/2.Contact-Milestone-Kitchens.htm</a>{% endraw %}
