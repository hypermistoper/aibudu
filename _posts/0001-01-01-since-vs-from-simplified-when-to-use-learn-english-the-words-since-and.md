{% raw %}The words since and from both are used to denote the starting time of an action. Yet, these words are used in very different contexts.<br /><br /><br /><br />Use of Since<br />The word since is used to present the starting time of an action that continues in the present till this date. For example:<br /><br /><br />Simple Example <br />Mr. Roy has been teaching quantum physics since 1995.<br /><br /><br />The above-mentioned sentence conveys that M. Roy started teaching quantum physics in 1995, and he continues to do so in the present time.<br /><br /><br />Simple Example <br />They have worked in this company since they finished their college.<br /><br /><br />This example sentence conveys that they started working in the company from the day they completed their college. And they still work in the same company<br /><br /><br />Use of From<br /><br /><br />The word from is also to present the starting point of an action.<br />Simple Example <br /><br /><br />The interview will start from 9 am tomorrow.<br /><br /><br />The above-mentioned sentence conveys that starting time of a particular interview is 9 am tomorrow.<br /><br /><br />Simple Example <br />On Sundays, the restaurant is open from 2 pm.<br /><br /><br />This example sentence presents the opening time of a restaurant on Sundays.<br /><br /><br />Since vs From – Point of Difference<br />The point to note about the usage of since and from is that with the usage of since, present perfect or present perfect continuous tense verbs is used as usage of since presents the starting point of an action that still continues. This is not the case with the usage of from.<br />Although both these words present the starting time of an action, they cannot be used interchangeably.<br />The doctor will be here from 10 am tomorrow – Correct<br />The doctor will be here since 10 am tomorrow – Incorrect<br /> The doctor has been waiting for you since 10 am – Correct<br />The doctor has been waiting for you from 10 am – Incorrect<br /><br /><br />Since vs From – Takeaways<br /><br /><br />Since is used to present the starting point of an action that continues in the present and takes the usage of present perfect or present perfect continuous tense verb.<br />From is used to present the straying point of an action.{% endraw %}
