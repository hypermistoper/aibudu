Please visit<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.PhoenixKeiaTarot.com">https://www.PhoenixKeiaTarot.com</a><br />I work with live energies only<br /><br />🔞AGE RESTRICTIONS<br />Please be aware that some of the decks I use contain graphic content &amp; I might sometimes swear.  This channel and it's videos are set to 18 and over with reason ;)<br />Personal readings are available to those 18 yrs and above<br /><br />⚠️ABOUT THE READINGS<br />Time is fluid, your message may not resonate with you straight away.  Please take from the messages what does resonate and leave what doesn't behind.  With the collective videos, they can not and will not resonate with everyone.  The readings on this channel are all made with good intent<br />Energy is interchangeable - If it fits, claim it.  If not, leave it be<br />The oracle cards work in the same way as the Tarot - it is for the viewer to decide what oracle cards are meant for them and what ones refer to their person/persons of interest Readers do not control what comes out in the cards!  Their job is just to pass on the message, it is for the viewer to decide if it's for them or not 🙂<br /><br />🔔HOW I READ<br />Please visit my ABOUT page to view my ethics t.ly/1vaz  (copy/paste short link into your browser) All my cards are cleared and shuffled thoroughly before filming. My own energy is also cleared between every read, therefore - no projection in the general readings<br />Every reader has their own way of interpreting &amp; laying the cards.  I prioritise the Hellenistic technique of distributions - which divides the year into 36 10-day segments<br />This technique also takes into account the planetary influences<br />A huge portion of the reading will be missed out if it's restricted only to the Zodiac<br />The Zodiacs already have their major Arcana, the planets have their own cards, the seasons have theirs and the Decans also have theirs<br />I also do not read one card energy.  I look at the other cards near each other - I also intuit a huge proportion and channelling during readings is not unusual<br />I do try to honour the system that each deck uses where possible; in fact one of my decks I actually use as a hybrid between two systems  Some decks will also have runes, others will have Hebrew letters, which I also try to include in the readings<br />There are so many different techniques for Tarot Reading and each one used is personal to the reader<br />Tarot is for everyone<br /><br />⚖️LEGALITIES<br />I am bound by Law to inform that readings are provided on an entertainment basis.  You must never make any major life changing decisions based on a read from any reader.  The final choice is yours. You do have free will<br /><br />💖CHANNEL SUPPORT<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/PhoenixKeia.">https://www.paypal.me/PhoenixKeia.</a><br />Another amazing way to show your support is to allow an advert to run, or you could visit my Teespring store at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnKpDX3M4lcvjMPmOY9JKkg/store">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnKpDX3M4lcvjMPmOY9JKkg/store</a><br />all support is massively appreciated<br /><br /> 🔮Please like, share and (or) subscribe - every interaction on the channel really does help<br />Thank you 🔮<br /><br />😍WHERE DID YOU GET THAT?<br />Due to lack of typing space here, I'll put links to interesting things seen in this video in my pinned comments below<br /><br />©️ 2022 Phoenix Keia Tarot.All Rights Reserved<br />You may NOT download this content and upload to your channel as if it's yours{% endraw %}
