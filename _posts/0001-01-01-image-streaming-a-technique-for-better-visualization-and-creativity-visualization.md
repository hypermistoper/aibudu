{% raw %}Visualization is a far more powerful tool than most people realize for problem solving, creativity and even physical performance. Our cognitive 'workspace' is essentially what gives us the ability to manipulate concepts in our mind and to make plans. It's essentially synonymous with our working memory.<br /><br />Einstein demonstrates the power of using visualization to solve problems. He visualized what it might be like to travel on a beam of light and used this to 'intuit' the workings of the universe. <br /><br />I'm not saying you'll be able to do that, but using a technique called 'Image Streaming' you can enhance your ability to visualize images, sounds and concepts and to work with them in your mind. Not only that, but you may improve verbal fluency and develop key brain regions related to visuo-spatial problem solving.
