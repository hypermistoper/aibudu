{% raw %}This one is for our EV nerds! Join Kyle as he starts to break down and analyze the DC Fast Charging profiles for the IONIQ 5. This is a bit trickier than other EVs as there are almost infinite charging curve possibilities based on starting State of Charge, battery pack thermals, and exterior ambient conditions (not to mention charging hardware). Hope you enjoy! <br /><br />We would really appreciate it if you subscribe to our channel! The more subscribers we have, the more awesome opportunities we will be able to bring to you! <br /><br />Kyle on Twitter: @itskyleconner<br />Kyle on Instagram: @Virtualkyle<br /><br />For more behind the scenes content:<br />Twitter: @Out_of_Spec<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/outofspecreviews">https://www.facebook.com/outofspecreviews</a><br />Instagram: @OutofSpecReviews<br /><br />Inquiries: info@outofspecstudios.com<br /><br />If you liked this video, we recommend checking out some of our other channels!<br />Out of Spec Motoring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/outofspecmotoring">http://youtube.com/outofspecmotoring</a> <br />Out of Spec Reviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/outofspecreviews">https://www.youtube.com/outofspecreviews</a><br /><br />#hyundai #ioniq5 #charging{% endraw %}
