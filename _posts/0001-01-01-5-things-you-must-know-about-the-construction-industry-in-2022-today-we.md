It is more important than ever to make sure procurement logs are up to date and the logistics of materials is completely understood.  It's not enough just to know the lead times of the products, you need to know fabrication times, where each step of delivery goes to and understanding how certain parts of the world may affect your material deliveries.  The risk may be on the contractor at this point to deal with supply chain issues, even if it's out of the contractor's control.  Provisions need to be made and proper planning and communication are necessary to address the supply chain issues. <br /><br />5:57 Construction Labor Shortages <br />With the US really pushing the college degree as the main path to success, there has been a shortage of younger people going into the construction trades.  It's also tough work which some may say is not suited for the younger generation, especially when you can find jobs that can work from home.  Developers want to build, but it is so tough to find the qualified individuals to run the field.  The construction industry needs to make a concerted effort to show the younger generation the possibilities a career in the trades can bring and make sure we are training the future leaders properly in the industry. <br /><br />7:53 Construction Technology<br />Especially with a labor shortage, it has become so important for the technology in construction to meet the needs of the industry.  The industry has been notorious for lagging in efficiency as every job can almost be thought of as a prototype.  With more people wanting to have WFH jobs, the industry should take some strides to fill more roles.  BIM modeling helps <br /><br />10:58 Work From Home? <br />It is very tough to build a construction project from your home.  However, there are more job opportunities opening up for WFH.  Some construction contracts require personnel to be on site, so be wary of that requirement.  Companies are likely upgrading their infrastructure to help employees work from home anyway, which may help with home life and create more flexibility.  The industry still requires a lot of hours, but at least you're not completely confined to the job site. <br /><br />13:22 Construction Industry Outlook 2022-Strong<br />With developers and the world beginning to cope with the illness, work will be opening up towards the end of the year and I foresee the construction industry remaining strong.  <br /><br />*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Kienen Koga will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
