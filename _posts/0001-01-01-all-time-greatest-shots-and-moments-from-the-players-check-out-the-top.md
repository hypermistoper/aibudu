{% raw %}Check out the top 40 shots throughout the history of THE PLAYERS Championship at TPC Sawgrass, featuring all-time shots by Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, Jordan Spieth and more.<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh">http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh</a><br /><br /><br /><br />The PGA TOUR heads to the iconic Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass for the 2022 edition of THE PLAYERS Championship. The top 30 golfers in the FedExCup standings, including 2017 FedExCup winner and defending champion Justin Thomas, will tee it up this week. World No.1 Jon Rahm, Rory McIlroy, Viktor Hovland and Collin Morikawa are just some of the biggest names in golf battling it out for the $3.6 million winner’s share. Hovland remains one of the hottest players in the game, leading at the halfway point of the Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard. Hideki Matsuyama is also in impressive form after winning the Sony Open this year. In 2020, Matsuyama tied the TPC Sawgrass scoring record (a 9-under 63) in the opening round and following the cancellation of that tournament, he'll be aiming to go all the way for the first time this year. The reigning FedExCup Champion, Patrick Cantlay, is looking to continue his excellent start to the season - he’s finished outside the top 10 in just one of his five starts so far. <br /><br /><br /><br />Welcome to the official YouTube channel of the PGA TOUR.
