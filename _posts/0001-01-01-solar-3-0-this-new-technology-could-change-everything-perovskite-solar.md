{% raw %}Perovskite solar cells might revolutionize how humans generate energy from sunlight. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://brilliant.org/ElectricFuture">https://brilliant.org/ElectricFuture</a> <br />First 200 people get 20% off annual premium subscription. <br /><br />In this video we’ll explore the world’s fastest improving new solar technology, and provide an exclusive peek inside the lab of a team working on this breakthrough material.<br /><br />Imagine an inexpensive solution of perovskite crystals that can make a photovoltaic cell so thin, that just half a cup of liquid would be enough to power a house. A solar panel so lightweight, that it can be balanced atop a soap bubble. That is known as the holy grail of solar energy. So when will we see perovskite solar panels used for a solar power system for your home? Maybe sooner than you expect.<br /><br />Currently, only 2% of global electricity comes from solar power. And 90% of that, comes from crystalline silicon-based solar panels, the dominant material technology.<br /><br />While abundant, silicon has downsides related to efficiency, manufacturing complexity, and pollution that prevent it from being an absolute no brainer. Emerging thin films like perovskites present a bright future. Imagine solar cars like a solar tesla, solar yachts, or a solar plane.<br /><br />Solar cell technologies can be classified into two categories, wafer-based or thin-film cells. Perovskites are the leading contender in emerging thin films. Topics covered in this video include applications, perovskite crystal structure, working principle of perovskite solar cells, efficiency limits, multi-junction solar cells, shockley-queisser limit, how solar works, solar simulator, band gap, manufacturing, vapor deposition, how solar panels are made, and the future of solar power.<br /><br />Thanks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.swiftsolar.com">http://www.swiftsolar.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/animagraffs">https://www.youtube.com/animagraffs</a>{% endraw %}
