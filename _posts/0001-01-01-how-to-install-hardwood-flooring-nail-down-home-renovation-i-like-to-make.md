{% raw %}Anyone can install nail down hardwood flooring and it looks AWESOME!<br /><br />Last time on my home renovation series, we laid down some floating hardwood floor in our bonus room conversion. It's a great product but a bit too expensive to carry throughout the entire house. For the rest of the home, we decided to nail down hardwood floor so that we could spend the money on a harder, nicer looking wood.<br />Nailing down flooring is something that ANYONE can do and it not only makes the rooms look nicer, but also adds value to the home over all!<br />The first step is to clean up the subfloor, getting it free of all debris including staples. Then add a layer of underlayment as a moisture barrier.<br />When laying the actual floor, the first few rows will need to be nailed down by hand. After you get far enough from the walls, you can use a pneumatic nailer to make the process go MUCH faster!<br />This entire room took me about a day an a half to complete.<br /><br />TOOLS &amp; SUPPLIES:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.builddirect.com/p/Mazama-Hardwood-Andes-Collection--15146274">https://www.builddirect.com/p/Mazama-Hardwood-Andes-Collection--15146274</a> - The flooring I used<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2wrbS6t">http://amzn.to/2wrbS6t</a> - Underlayment<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2xvQoCs">http://amzn.to/2xvQoCs</a> - Flooring nailer &amp; Mallet<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kit.co/iliketomakestuff/my-woodworking-tools">https://kit.co/iliketomakestuff/my-woodworking-tools</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://kit.co/iliketomakestuff/shop-safety-gear">https://kit.co/iliketomakestuff/shop-safety-gear</a><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/ILikeToMakestuffSubscribe">http://bit.ly/ILikeToMakestuffSubscribe</a><br />Check out my TopVideos!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/ILikeToMakeStuffTopVideos">http://bit.ly/ILikeToMakeStuffTopVideos</a><br /><br />Learn 3d modeling, get digital plans, and cool merch at <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://iliketomakestuff.com">https://iliketomakestuff.com</a><br /><br />Want to support ILTMS?
