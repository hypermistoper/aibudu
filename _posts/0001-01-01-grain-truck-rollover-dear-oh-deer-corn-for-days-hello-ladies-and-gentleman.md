{% raw %}Hello Ladies and Gentleman and as always Thank You for watching.   Today our crew tackles a grain truck that has rolled over while it was hauling a load of feed corn.  Some viewers may recognize the location.  We were very close to where a Semi truck loaded with leaking barrels of  Hazardous Materials rolled over last year.  We also drive past a job site where we worked an overturned tanker that was also leaking Hazardous Materials.   Seems as though this is a dangerous stretch of road, even though it's flat ground.   We use the Rotator, our 2015 Peterbilt 389X with a Miller Industries 1150R, our 2006 Western Star with a Vulcan V70, our unit#15, our Service truck #9 with HazMat cleanup materials and barrels, as well as a few extra hands to help clean up this mess.    All in all it went well.  Nobody was injured during the crash or the recovery.  <br />Again, I wish to thank everyone who has expressed their prayers and/or condolences for the death of my Dad.  The outpouring of support from my viewers has been tremendous and has helped in this difficult time.  May God bless each and every one of you.   Also, thank you for your patience.   I am still making videos, but I took a couple weeks off-call after my dad passed, so I wasn't doing very many jobs.  This is another job trying to get to the new normal without Dad.  I will continue to perform jobs and create videos, as long as God allows.  Things will be different moving forward.  I have to trust that God will guide me and this channel.  <br />Again, a very special thank you to all my viewers, family, and friends who having taken the time to show their support.   May God bless and protect you all!!   <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/RotatorRon">https://www.paypal.me/RotatorRon</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.guardianangeldevices.com/m/towtruck-safety-light/?code=122">https://www.guardianangeldevices.com/m/towtruck-safety-light/?code=122</a> Follow the link for special pricing on the Guardian Angel Elite seen in this video.
