Near London.<br />Where do you go to university? ~ Minerva Schools at KGI. I spent my first year in San Francisco, my second semester in Berlin, and now I'm in Seoul :)<br />Did you take a gap year? ~ Yes! From 2018-2019, I interrailed Europe, worked in London, backpacked Australia, did a French language immersion in France and spent 3 months in Uganda.
