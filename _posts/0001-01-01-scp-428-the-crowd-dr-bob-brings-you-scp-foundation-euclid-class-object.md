While huddled in a circle, SCP-428 is to be considered in a ‘dormant’ state. In this state, the crowd moves with a gentle sway and can be heard audibly mumbling. The ‘people’ of SCP 428 closest to a person will attempt to grab and pull them into the middle of the crowd. After contact is made for more than ten seconds, the person will become a new member of SCP428. <br /><br />Watch ALL of DrBob's videos including SCP 150 The Body Stealing Parasite and SCP 3700 Tides of War here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHxBeJ7z3xRleoXfcoFZxHgqji3jKgWwV">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHxBeJ7z3xRleoXfcoFZxHgqji3jKgWwV</a><br /><br />Watch TheRubber videos if you like these, this video was inspired by The Rubber animation style:<br /><br />SCP-096 The Shy Guy (SCP Animated)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEjrSZLFxUY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XEjrSZLFxUY</a><br /><br />SCP-682 Indestructible Creature (SCP Animated)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dGt63SML_8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2dGt63SML_8</a><br /><br />This video, being derived from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-428">https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/scp-428</a> written by DrScooter, is released under Creative Commons Sharealike 3.0. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/</a><br /><br />Narrated by Joe Cliff Thompson<br />#drbob #scp #animation{% endraw %}
