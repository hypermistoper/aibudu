{% raw %}Jack takes a look around the new GV60, the maiden EV from Korean luxury brand, Genesis. If you’ve never heard of them, that’s understandable - they only came to the European market last year. Typically, new brands who try to encroach on the posh family car space that the German trifecta of BMW, Audi and Mercedes has dominated for decades don’t fare especially well - just ask Infiniti. But Jack suspects this new upstart may be in with a better chance of success. Check out the video to find out why.<br /><br />Jack's blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fullycharged.show/blog/can-hyundais-genesis-brand-succeed-in-europe-were-cautiously-optimistic/">https://fullycharged.show/blog/can-hyundais-genesis-brand-succeed-in-europe-were-cautiously-optimistic/</a><br /><br />Fully Charged LIVE is BACK!
