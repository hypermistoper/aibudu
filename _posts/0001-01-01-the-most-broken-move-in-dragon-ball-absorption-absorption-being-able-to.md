{% raw %}Absorption. Being able to absorb your opponent in Dragon Ball was probably the most broken ability. This had to be what made Majin Buu The Ultimate Menace (yeah i saw the vid). Think about it If you're losing to someone, you can just yoink their abilities and get rid of them altogether. Naturally, I had to do my best to make something like that work in Xenoverse 2 throught my Absorption Series with Kyushu.<br /><br />FULL SERIES PLAYLIST:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFqVyRXKJ0WMGNjzwHvxuao5ZGA_OWGAU">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFqVyRXKJ0WMGNjzwHvxuao5ZGA_OWGAU</a><br /><br />Thanks as always for the support.
