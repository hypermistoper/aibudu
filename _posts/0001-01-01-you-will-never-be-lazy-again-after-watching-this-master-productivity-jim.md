He is the Founder and CEO of Kwik Learning, an online brain training and learning firm where he teaches people how to get the most out of their minds. Jim suffered a brain injury at the age of five, which led to slow brain performance and left him struggling in school. As the years wore on, he undertook a journey to learn about his brain – why it was “broken” and what he could do to fix it.<br /><br />That journey led him to discovering different learning habits, including accelerated learning systems and tactics. He spent years training his brain for speed-reading and memory improvement. Companies like SpaceX and Virgin, owned by billionaire geniuses like Richard Branson and Elon Musk, have trained with him. He’s also trained major celebrities and political leaders such as Will Smith, Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey, and many others.<br /><br />Jim just released his new book Limitless: Upgrade Your Brain, Learn Anything Faster, and Unlock Your Exceptional Life on April 28th, 2020. As a kid, Jim loved superheroes and comic books inspired him to reach for greatness, even when people told him it was impossible. Over the years, Jim unlocked his greatest superpower – his mind – and you can too.{% endraw %}
