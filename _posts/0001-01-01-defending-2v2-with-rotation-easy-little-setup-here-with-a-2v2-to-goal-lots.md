{% raw %}Easy little setup here with a 2v2 to goal. Lots of opportunities to not only practice those 1v1 defensive skills but also the role of the covering defender (2nd defender). <br /><br />I recommend giving each game a time limit of about 10-15 seconds as we also want to reward the defenders for slowing the attackers down to a point where their attack loses momentum.<br /><br />Adapt to a 3v2 making this a touch harder for the defensive pair.{% endraw %}
