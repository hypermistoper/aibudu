{% raw %}Every foreign-owned disregarded U.S. LLC must file a Form 5472 with a proforma Form 1120 every tax year.  However, it is not always so simple.  The topics covered in this video are the following:<br /><br />1. Who needs to file Form 5472.<br />2. What is a U.S. Trade or Business (USTOB) and how does that change the filing requirements?<br />3. When might your LLC be subject to U.S. taxes?<br />4. Example of Form 5472 with proforma Form 1120. <br /><br />WARNING:  Failure to properly identify whether a USTOB exists can result in massive tax consequences and penalties.  Always consult an international tax advisor before completing your Form 5472.<br /><br />What is Reportable Transaction:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/x9LT8A2KuNI">https://youtu.be/x9LT8A2KuNI</a><br />Cost Sharing Arrangements:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/KukAdb8C3Rw">https://youtu.be/KukAdb8C3Rw</a><br />Do I Need Form 1040-NR:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/VjwjoewQ4x4">https://youtu.be/VjwjoewQ4x4</a><br /><br />If you want to learn more information in a course format, please check out my Form 5472 course below:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.udemy.com/user/jason-knott-2/">https://www.udemy.com/user/jason-knott-2/</a><br /><br />Check out our website for more posts:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lawofficesofjasonknott.com/blog/">https://www.lawofficesofjasonknott.com/blog/</a><br /><br />Need more help?
