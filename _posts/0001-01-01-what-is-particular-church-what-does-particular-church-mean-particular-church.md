PARTICULAR CHURCH meaning.<br /><br />In Catholic canon law, a particular church (Latin: ecclesia particularis) is an ecclesiastical community headed by a bishop or someone recognised as the equivalent of a bishop.<br /><br />There are two kinds of particular churches:<br /><br />    Local particular churches. A diocese or eparchy is the most familiar form of such local particular churches, but there are other forms, including that of a territorial abbacy, an apostolic vicariate and an apostolic prefecture.<br /><br />    Autonomous particular churches, also known as particular churches sui iuris. In this context the descriptors autonomous (Greek) and sui iuris (Latin) are synonymous, each meaning &quot;of its own law&quot;. These are aggregations of local diocesan churches that share a specific liturgical, theological and canonical tradition. They have also been called &quot;particular Churches or rites&quot;. The largest such autonomous particular church is the Latin Church. The others are referred to collectively as the Eastern Catholic Churches. The larger Eastern Catholic churches are headed by a bishop who has the title and rank of patriarch or major archbishop.{% endraw %}
