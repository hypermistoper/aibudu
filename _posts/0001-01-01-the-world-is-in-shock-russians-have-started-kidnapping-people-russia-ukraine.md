{% raw %}The ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine was Dec by the Victory Day celebrations held on Red Square yesterday. While Putin's speeches in which he tried to justify his war on Ukraine drew attention, an allegation from the United States stirred up a stir. When Pentagon officials announced what Russia had done to countless Ukrainians, it almost moved the place. Allegations have been made before that Russia forcibly took Ukrainians to Russia during the ongoing war. This time, the same things were raised by Pentagon Spokesman John Kirby. Kirby said the U.S. has found signs of a ‘mandatory evacuation’. Reports on the matter had previously revealed that many Ukrainians had been sent to camps in Russia. It was reported that Ukrainian citizens taken to such camps were interrogated, subjected to naked searches, fingerprinted, and their phones and official documents were checked by Vladimir Putin's forces. According to the United States, the number of Ukrainians taken to Russia against their will is one million 200 thousand people. Kirby, the Pentagon Spokesman, did not characterize these deportations as ethnic cleansing and stressed that it is not the Pentagon's job to make such determinations. But he said there was plenty of evidence of 'Russian brutality' during the war.{% endraw %}
