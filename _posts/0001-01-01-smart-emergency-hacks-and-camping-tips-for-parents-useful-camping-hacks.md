{% raw %}Useful camping hacks and first aid tips for smart parents<br /><br /><br /><br />Hey crafty moms and dads! If you decide to go camping with your family, take a look at these useful hacks and valuable gadgets to make your trip perfect. If you saw a splinter under your kid's skin, you can easily remove it with a syringe. When you are on the road and your kids are bored, they will undoubtedly ask you to grab their toys and gadgets from the trunk. If you don’t want to spend too much time opening the trunk when your kids want toys, then we will show you a clever way to store all the toys and devices in a car (right next to the back seat). When getting ready for a car trip, don’t forget about getting a small portable toilet for your children. It will make traveling for your kids way more comfortable and less stressful. <br /><br />In addition, you will see some random emergency hacks for parents. For example, if your kids get a slight injury while playing at the playground, you can use a tampon to stop the blood. If it happens at home, you can freeze a pack of marshmallows or other snacks and use it to reduce the bruise. <br /><br /><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br /><br />00:22 - How to remove a splinter<br /><br />00:36 - Smart emergency hacks for parents<br /><br />01:39 - How to protect your kid from mosquitoes<br /><br />03:25 - DIY pool for your child<br /><br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
