{% raw %}In this video, I would like to share with you all the exercises I do to practice speaking skills by myself. They are based on the shadow boxing method that you can practice every day even if you don't have native speakers around. I basically use them to get a basic level of conversation before trying to talk to native speakers, like talking with a language exchange partner. <br /><br />This video is meant to share my experience and give you some inspiration. If you have better methods, please share them with us in the comments. Much love to you! <br /><br />⭐️Photogaphy: Zoe <br />⭐️Editing: Zoe<br />⭐️Subtitles: Zoe{% endraw %}
