{% raw %}Lyrics:<br /><br />Oh, the devil's inside<br />You opened the door<br />You gave him a ride<br />Too young to know, too old to admit<br />That you couldn't see how it ends<br /><br />What did you do to my eyes<br />What did you sing to that lonely child<br />Promised it all but you lied<br />You better slow down baby soon<br />It's all or nothing to you<br /><br />The glow of Hollywood signs<br />They sold you a bridge<br />They fed you a line (they fed you to lions)<br />You always confused your servants for friends<br />But you couldn't see how it ends<br />It's all or nothing to you<br /><br />What did you do to my eyes<br />What did you say to my only child<br />Promised your love but you lied<br />You better slow down baby soon<br />It's all or nothing to you<br /><br />What did you do to my eyes<br />What did you sing to that lonely child<br />Promised it all but you lied<br />You better slow down baby soon<br /><br />---<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS SONG IN ANY WAY!
