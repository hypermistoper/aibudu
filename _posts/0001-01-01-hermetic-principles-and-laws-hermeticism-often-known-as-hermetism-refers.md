{% raw %}Hermeticism, often known as Hermetism, refers to a philosophical ideology based mainly on the reputed teachings of Hermes Trismegistus. It comprises the legendary Hellenistic combination of the Greek God Hermes and the Egyptian God Thoth.<br />These teachings can be found in the various texts assigned to Hermes (the Hermetica). These scripts were written over a longer period (c. 300 BCE â€“ 1200 CE) and may differ materially in both content and depth.<br />One of the most prominent contexts of the term refers to a particular subsection of Hermetic texts regarded as the 'philosophical' Hermetica. The most noteworthy sub-group is the Corpus Hermeticum (an assemblage of seventeen Greek Hermetic treatises recorded between c. 100 and c. 300 CE).{% endraw %}
