{% raw %}Watch as Tyler shares 5 steps in loading your dishwasher correctly.  Plus a few extra tips to get those dirty dishes clean as a whistle. <br /><br />Step 1: Should you clean all the food off your dishes before you place them in your dishwasher?<br />* Yes and No - You should scrape all the food off but do not rinse.  Dishwasher soap needs something to cling to and if all the food it washed off already then the soap will cling to your dishes and weaken them. This could cause them to crack later on.  This could also lead to glasses becoming hazy with a film. <br /><br />Step 2: Dish placement:   On the bottom rack you should put larger items in the back.  This is not just for convenience but many dishwashers place more jets and will clean the larger more soiled pots and pans. Do not place glasses over the tines. This could cause the cups to move around and scratch and damage.  Do not overlap the dishes either.  <br /><br />Step 3:  Loading the utensil basket.  Take advantage of what the manufactures provides you.  You should then ad your utensil's half up and half down so it eliminates some of the tendency for the forks and spoons to nest together and not receive the required water to clean.  Knifes should always be placed down for safety reasons.   <br /><br />Sept 4:  Don't Block the wash arms are not blocked.   Usually it is some time of handle or utensil that may be blocking the wash arms from turning. <br /><br />Step 5:  Don't over load the dishwasher.  This is the number 1 way to make it so your dishes do not clean. <br /><br />Bonus:  If there is a hazy film on your dishwasher.  You may be using to much detergent.  Try a lesser amount or a different type.  You can also use rinse aid and this would help!  <br /><br />Bonus Tip #2: If your cycle did not clean check to make sure the soap dropped into the dishwasher.  Many times large items can block the soap door from opening and it that happened the soap was never allowed to do its job.  <br /><br />Thanks for watching!
