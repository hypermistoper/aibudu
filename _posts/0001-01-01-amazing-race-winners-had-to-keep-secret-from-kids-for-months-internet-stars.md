{% raw %}Internet stars Kim and Penn Holderness are the newest winners of “The Amazing Race.” The season was like no other, as it had a 19-month gap in production due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Kim and Penn are in their mid-forties, making them the oldest couple to ever win the show’s competition. Inside Edition viewers might recognize Kim from her time as a reporter for the show. The couple had to keep their win a secret from their children, who only found out at a special viewing party of the finale.{% endraw %}
