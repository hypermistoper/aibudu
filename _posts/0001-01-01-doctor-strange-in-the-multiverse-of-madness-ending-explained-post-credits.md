The film follows him as he goes toe to toe with Wanda in the Marvel Magic version of Civil War and we culminate with him meeting a brand new character that teases an upcoming threat come the end of the film.<br /><br />That's as far as I wanna get before we go spoiler heavy so if you haven't had a chance to check it out then check out now. There will be no memory spells from this point on but please hit the thumbs up button and don't forget to subscribe for unforgettable breakdowns.<br /><br />With that out the way, thanks for clicking this, now let's get into Doctor Strange In The Multiverse of Madness.<br /><br />Ok so the movie opens with Defender Strange attempting to protect America Chavez from a giant demon attempting to steal her powers. Attempting to get to the book of Vishanti, this seems like the only way to stop whatever it is that's chasing them. Incase you don't know, the book of Vishanti in the comics is described as being a text comprised of pure light that has the ability to counter it's opposite The Darkhold. Wanna got her filthy little black fingers on this during Wandavision and we learn throughout the film that it's slowly started corrupting her over time.<br /><br />Now America has similar powers to how she does in the comics except for she can't really control them here which becomes a big character arc that she goes on. When feeling scared her powers come into affect and she's able to open up multiversal portals that appear like stars, similar to the source material. However she hasn't quite come to grips with these yet and the movie actually paints Defender Strange out as quite a bad guy because he tries to kill her in order to strip her of these powers early on. Much in the same way that the MCU one said he would be happy to sacrifice Peter and Tony to protect the timestone in Infinity War, this guy literally says 'f**k them kids.' However the demon stabs and America manages to escape into the MCU main universe along with Defender Strange who dies just after freeing her from it's grasp.<br /><br />In the film we learn that America got scared once by a bee and she opened a portal which sucked her mothers through. America believed that this killed them however Strange does say that he thinks they're alive which is in keeping with the comics.<br /><br />► Artist Attribution<br />Music By KaizanBlu<br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/KaizanBlu​">https://www.youtube.com/c/KaizanBlu​</a><br />Licence: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/</a>{% endraw %}
