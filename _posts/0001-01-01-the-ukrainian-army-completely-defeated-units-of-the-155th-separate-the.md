{% raw %}The Ukrainian army completely defeated units of the 155th Separate <br /><br />The Armed Forces of Ukraine inflicted another devastating defeat on the Russian occupants. According to Ukrainian journalist Roman Tsimbalyuk on his page on Facebook, as a result of combat operations units of the 155th separate brigade of marines of the Russian Armed Forces, which is permanently stationed in the city of Vladivostok (military unit 30926), were almost completely destroyed.  According to the journalist, the occupants lost about 600 servicemen killed and an equal number of wounded. Such great losses were caused by a rash decision of the brigade command. <br /><br />It is also reported that the brigade personnel have no access to food and housing. The journalist does not specify in which direction the mentioned brigade of the occupants acted.{% endraw %}
