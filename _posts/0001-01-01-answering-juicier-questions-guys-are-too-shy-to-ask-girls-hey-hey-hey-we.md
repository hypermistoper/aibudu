{% raw %}Hey hey hey, we are back!!!<br /><br />Due to popular demand- hubs and I are at it again with even JUICIER questions! This time, itâ€™s his turn to ask me questions guys are too afraid to ask girls. Tbh, it got heated! For me at least! This is probably the first time I got real sweaty in a Q&amp;A!!! Itâ€™s not for the faint of heart and definitely not for kids. He asked me some really intimate stuff like being a virgin, what my turn offs are and if size matters. Hmmm girls... what do you think? lol Share some laughs with us? Sit back, grab a cup and enjoy!<br />---<br />Music from EPIDEMIC SOUND: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/38jRSq">http://share.epidemicsound.com/38jRSq</a><br />(free 30 day trial with link above!)<br /><br />Follow ME:<br />www.kryzuy.com<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/kryzzzie">http://instagram.com/kryzzzie</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/kryzzzie">http://twitter.com/kryzzzie</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/kryzzzie">http://facebook.com/kryzzzie</a>{% endraw %}
