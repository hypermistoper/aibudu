{% raw %}In amongst the joy of coming together, we were guided to stand as one - to bring visibility to the message of this song. To stand up for our children and face the adversities that risk their well-being. <br /><br />Before and after what you see, we held each other in circle. Speaking, being, loving, crying, mourning - in the name of all children. Together we rise. <br /><br />To anyone out there who feels alone in the stand against harm for our children, you are not on your own. We all stand side by side, by your side, protecting our children.<br /><br />This song belongs to you too, this is our collective truth. The power of our unity strengthens our voice. It is our way of reclaiming the freedom of parents and guardians right to choose and to protect. <br /><br />So together we say “Hands Off our Children”<br /><br />Spotify:  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/75gPezOqyKVkYTJpM9x1BX?si=7_DeWcPtQRWrA28H8Kic-Q">https://open.spotify.com/track/75gPezOqyKVkYTJpM9x1BX?si=7_DeWcPtQRWrA28H8Kic-Q</a><br />IG : @handsoffourchildren_nz<br /><br />Donate Here :<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://joydahmae.com/gofundme">https://joydahmae.com/gofundme</a><br /><br />Hands off our Children T-shirts available here <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://joydahmae.com/handsoffourchildren">https://joydahmae.com/handsoffourchildren</a><br /><br /><br /><br />art by @anakayla <br />video by @cadbykong <br /><br />#handsoffourchildren #handsoffourkids #ourvoiceourchoice #freedom #defendingourchildren #aotearoa{% endraw %}
