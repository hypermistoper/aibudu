{% raw %}The year is 1943. Polkovnik Vishnevskiy receives an order from the government to train a group of diversant soldiers to stop the actions of a German army group called &quot;Eidelveis&quot;. The mission is a top-secret one. Vishnevskiy trains young (14-15 year old) boys from juvenile detention facilities because he knows they will never return. The boys also know that if they survive the mission they all will be eliminated.{% endraw %}
