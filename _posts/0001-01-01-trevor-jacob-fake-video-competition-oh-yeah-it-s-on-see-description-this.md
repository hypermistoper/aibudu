{% raw %}THIS IS A TEST!<br /><br />Ok so we tried to use the green screen and make the banjo scene look real just to see how many people would buy into it.   The banjo scene was shot in the hangar with the front end jacked up and engine running so I could make it look like I was driving.<br /><br />Next, I made it look like I issued a DC-3 type rating at a chili lunch fly in where the pilot flies a Lockheed in and we aren’t anywhere near a DC-3!<br /><br />How many people will actually believe either?!?!{% endraw %}
