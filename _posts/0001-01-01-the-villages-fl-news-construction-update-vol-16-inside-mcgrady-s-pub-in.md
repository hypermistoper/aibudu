{% raw %}In this episode of Continuing the Dream, Jennifer Morse Parr takes us inside the much-anticipated McGrady’s Pub at Sawgrass Grove for a tour with Spencer Novak, Executive Director of Hospitality at The Villages, and Troy Anderson, McGrady's General Manager.<br /><br />As they prepare to open the doors, take a peek inside at the cozy dining spaces, the kitchen that will turn out authentic Scottish cuisine, and the bar, which will have 35 Scotch whiskies, plus a limited-edition mug club for the draft beer-lovers in town.  <br /><br />No doubt, McGrady's will quickly become a popular neighborhood bar where everyone knows your name.
