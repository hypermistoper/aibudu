From the early 2000s to this day, the alternative and metal music genres have been a major part of both our lives. Countless songs by badass bands and artists - they were always there for us when we needed them. They empowered and encouraged us, helped us deal with pain and hardships, they were a way to vent and a way to find out there were people in this world like us, with thoughts and feelings we could relate to. And today we want to bring you a soundtrack for the reality you are living, no matter where you are in life, if you ever feel like nobody cares what you do or who you are, just put your headphones on. We want you to have something to carry with you, and to tune into whenever you most need it. We want you to feel confident; we want you to feel strong.<br /><br />Lead guitar, bass by Nicholas Standing<br />Written and produced by Vladimir Kuznetsov<br />Special thanks to: Speeder for his support in making and promoting this album, Marica Vilibic for lending her incredible voice for Revolt and everyone who bought our music in the past making this project possible.<br /><br />#metal #alternative #naftsidi #worldbeyond{% endraw %}
