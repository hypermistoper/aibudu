{% raw %}To kick start the 2022 metal detecting season with a Colonial era farm field flanked by old houses on each side. We had access to the fields but after meeting the friendly homeowners and setting up some machines for them to join us we got access to the houses as well. Incredible old copper coins, early US coins, and even a massive silver coin that almost gave Doug a heart attack right on the spot. I have a feeling its gonna be a good year...<br /><br /> ==========================================<br />Are you thinking about trying out metal detecting for yourself?
