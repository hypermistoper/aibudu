{% raw %}Action plans answer the question, how will we achieve our goals? They often garner less attention than the strategic planning process which takes a large share of our time. The steps in developing an action plan deserve just as much attention. <br /><br />We create action plans for an initiative. We roll initiatives throughout an organization in three steps.<br /><br />The first is determining what we must achieve. What problem are we solving? When will we complete the initiative? We also need to define what is in and out of scope. This step solidifies the initiative and accelerates action.<br /><br />Second, be clear on what you need to be successful. Think of this step as a checklist. Do we have the budget, capabilities, dependencies, or any roadblocks? If we don’t have the tools we need or are unable to clear any obstacles in our way, then completing the initiatives becomes less likely.<br /><br />Third, let’s define how we will accomplish our initiative. Identify the action items you need to complete and organize them into quarters throughout the year. Action items need to start with a verb and have clear deliverables. <br /><br />Our steps in developing an action plan help to uncomplicate the process and keep your organization on track. Now go build your action plan today!   <br /><br />More information is available at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.OnStrategyHQ.com">https://www.OnStrategyHQ.com</a><br /><br />Download the guide here -<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://onstrategyhq.com/smart-goals-guide-download/">https://onstrategyhq.com/smart-goals-guide-download/</a>{% endraw %}
