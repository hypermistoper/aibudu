{% raw %}Through turning degraded land into forest, an inspiring Kenyan woman has created a gorgeous natural homestead. 10 years ago, the land was barren, overgrazed and degraded. Today it's a unique place that blends in beautifully with the forest that surrounds it.<br /><br /><br />The beautiful intro song is &quot;Be Still&quot; by the wonderful Joe Holtaway.
