I wasn't too surprised when many of my days surpassed over 3000 calories a day. It's all about listening to your body, as always! this isn't a cheat week -- it's just me listening to my body and indulging every day in moderation! balance, baby!!<br /><br />remember: health is more than calories, or weight loss, or getting perfect flat abs. It's about feeling strong, joyful and energized -- and many times, counting calories leads to not fueling yourself properly.
