{% raw %}With Madrid rents too high for young architects Ignacio and Pilar, they decided to turn their studio into a stealthy home. They buried the kitchen essentials - refrigerator, pantry - inside the walls of their workspace and added a second room to serve as their bedroom. <br /><br />To avoid drawing attention to the residential addition, they clad it in a reflective surface (methacrylate with a mirror finish) so it would take blend with the garden.<br /><br />The couple dubbed their home “The Burrow” both because of its stealth mode and because it is partially underground; they also call it “a lair, a hideout, a shelter”. Besides a small sliver window in the back, the bedroom’s only opening to the outside world is through a round, galvanized steel window, “the oculus”, “which reflects and blurs the incoming light”.<br /><br />There were originally two skylights on the structure, but 2021's Storm Filomena - Spain’s largest snowstorm in 50 years - knocked a tree onto the home and broke the glass. The home itself withstood the incredible snow loads, though the couple was snowed in for a week.<br /><br />The space is a mix of natural materials like the cork-clad ceiling (as insulation) and the thatch roof. Ignacio and Pilar say they worried at first that clients might not see their home-studio as professional enough, but instead, they find that while clients may not want to build their own burrow, they fall in love with the coziness of the space.<br /><br />&quot;Tini&quot; Tiny House <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyhome.es/en/">https://tinyhome.es/en/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://delavegacanolasso.com/">https://delavegacanolasso.com/</a><br />Simon Prize: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.simonprize.org/work2020/the-burrow/sheet/">https://www.simonprize.org/work2020/the-burrow/sheet/</a><br /><br />On *faircompanies: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://faircompanies.com/videos/the-burrow-homestudio-reflects-hidden-zen-garden-pond/">https://faircompanies.com/videos/the-burrow-homestudio-reflects-hidden-zen-garden-pond/</a>{% endraw %}
