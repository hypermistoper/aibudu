{% raw %}Why women are so Attracted to Sigma Male, and Sigma male personality traits. In this video you will learn what are sigma males, sigma male traits, and why women find sigma males so attractive.  <br /><br />If you like this video consider subscribing to our channel :)<br /><br />You’re most likely pretty familiar with the male social hierarchy with  terms like alpha males, and beta males.  Alpha males being at the top.  Beta males being a step below, followed by delta, gamma, and omega.  The sigma male however does not fit in here at all.  A sigma male does not lead or follow others.  A sigma male does not feel the overwhelming urge to follow a boss, and he also does not feel the need to settle as being a follower.  Sigmas can actually be of equal status as alphas, because they frequently attract sexual partners, and can be very charismatic.  If you’re a sigma male, you actually gain your power from being an outsider.  You value yourself, and your freedom too much to participate in the game of trying to gain your position in the social hierarchy.<br /><br />#sigma #sigmamale #sigmamaletraits{% endraw %}
