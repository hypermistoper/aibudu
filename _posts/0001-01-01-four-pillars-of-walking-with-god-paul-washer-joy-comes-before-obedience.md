{% raw %}Joy comes before obedience, rather than after. If you don't understand that, you will really be messed up all of your days. Joy is not the result of obedience, joy is the result of what God has done. So now your joy is fixed on a fixed and stable source. When your joy is based on your performance it is going to be up and down like the wind. - Paul Washer<br /><br />PDF &amp; MP3: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://illbehonest.com/four-pillars-of-walking-with-god-paul-washer">http://illbehonest.com/four-pillars-of-walking-with-god-paul-washer</a><br /><br />Paul Washer of @HeartCry Missionary Society{% endraw %}
