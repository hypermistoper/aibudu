{% raw %}AN ALTERNATIVE (AND EASIEST) WAY FOR GETTING INTO MEDIUM PUBLICATIONS FOR BEGINNERS. DOESN'T REQUIRE ADDITIONAL WORK.<br /><br />I'm a new writer on Medium and, since my first article, I've been hearing about publications and how useful they are - particularly for novice writers. <br /><br />I read all about this topic to find out how to get into Medium publications: you need to find a pub, read their guidelines, pitch your story and, often, submit an application. <br /><br />I did it and...I was rejected. <br /><br />But then, I changed my focus and discovered that there's a different way of getting into publications that didn't require any additional work. Rather than looking for publications, publications found me. <br /><br />This alternative route earned me the title of a writer for FOUR different pubs so far, including The Startup and The Post-Grad Survival Guide. <br /><br />If you're a beginner and you're struggling to get into a publication, I think you should try this. <br /><br />Let me know if you have any questions,<br />TWG x<br /> _ _ _<br /><br />JOIN ME FOR A LIVE WRITING SESSION ON THURSDAY 1ST OF OCTOBER 2020 AT 7PM GMT. <br /><br />_ _ _<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS<br />0:00 - Intro <br />1:32 - What are the benefits of writing for a Medium publication?<br />2:41 - How to get into a Medium publication?
