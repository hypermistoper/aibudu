{% raw %}The Happy Camper interviews filmmakers Northern Scavengers on their latest canoe trip - The Land of Wild Rivers. It's a 10 part video-series documenting the 2021 Côte-Nord: Maze to the Aguanish expedition. Episode 1 will be dropping February 2nd, 2022 and will roll out every Wednesday at 6:00 pm EST. You're not going to want to miss this one!  <br /><br />SYNOPSIS <br />A 30 day, 620 km canoe journey through the expansive wilderness of Côte-Nord, Quebec. The route is designed to traverse the headwaters of the Romaine River, a river seeing significant change as part of Quebec’s major energy project Plan Nord, followed by the descent of the little-known Aguanish River. The goal of the route is to gain a first-hand perspective of the land of wild rivers as they paddle and portage their way across the Labrador-Quebec plateau to the Gulf of St. Lawrence.<br /><br />Northern Scavengers <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2NxX1LCe7w&amp;t=61s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O2NxX1LCe7w&amp;t=61s</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.northernscavenger.com/">https://www.northernscavenger.com/</a>{% endraw %}
