You look like you've seen a ghost.&quot;<br /><br />And you walk<br />Under the streetlights<br />And you're too drunk to notice that everyone's staring at you<br />You don't care what you look like<br />The world is falling around you<br /><br />You just have to see her<br />You just have to see her<br />You just have to see her<br />You just have to see her<br />You just have to see her<br /><br />You know that she'll break you in two{% endraw %}
