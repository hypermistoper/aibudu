I will show you more pillars nearby, but here you can see at least 20 pillars. You realize that these are quite exotic, Archeologists confirm that yes, you need a lathe machine, a rotating mechanism to make such pillars. You can see a lot of scrawling on the stones, these were done by vandals this is why now they have put these barricades and prevented anyone from taking a closer look. I really wish I could get inside and examine them better and can also show some good details. I have shown you finished and assembled pillars set up in ancient temples, but to see a bunch of these freestanding pillars is a rare sight.  <br />Many people argue that pillars and temple parts would be made on site, but I think they were usually made in a different location. It is usually a centralized location, an ancient megalithic manufacturing factory. I have shown you one in Warangal fort, it is also a fantastic place where you can see a variety of temple parts strewn in one place.  So, these parts would then be transported to the temple site, and then assembled. If you see the pillar in the middle, this is a male pillar because it has a projection on top, and it will fit onto another female block. But this one is a female, it does not have a projection, but it probably has a hole on top. So, the ancient builders must have planned the assembling parts very well. Notice that each pillar is different from any other pillar, they look similar, but you can pause or rewind and check these pillars, each one is actually different from another pillar.<br />Now, nearby we can see more pillars. You are looking at atleast 25 different pillars and you may have realized that none of them are the same, each and every pillar is different from all others. Actually, at the back we can see more pillars, but again each one is different. The pillars are anywhere from 3 feet to 7 feet tall. <br />Here is a fabulous pillar which looks like a long-geared shaft, imagine what kind of machining technique and mechanism would have been needed to make this. Let us see what is on top of this, a perfect square hole. So, this is a female pillar. Now what are we looking at, right? <br />We are looking at a spare part, like an extra screw lying around in a garage. It was just a backup, it was never polished and used. Some of this pillarâ€™s sisters are fit inside the temple, and they look incredible after polishing, and when assembled with other stone blocks.<br /><br />#AncientTechnology #Hinduism #PraveenMohan{% endraw %}
