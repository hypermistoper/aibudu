{% raw %}This year I renewed my passport and they sent me back my old passport with ten years of memories and sentimental value. I practice non-materialism and non-ownership and strive to be present in life by owning few possessions. I decided to use this passport as an opportunity to share my tips on how to downsize and simplify your life. <br />Millions of people desire to downsize their life and get rid of possessions, but often express that they feel lost on how to get started. In this video I share my journey from a collector to minimalist and my tips on how you can free yourself of possessions to live a happier, healthier and simpler life!<br /><br />The Beginner’s Guide to Downsize Your Life: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.robgreenfield.org/downsize/">https://www.robgreenfield.org/downsize/</a><br /><br />Video filmed and edited by Paul O'Neill.<br />See his videos here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vimeo.com/channels/eyeforart">https://vimeo.com/channels/eyeforart</a><br /><br />Rob Greenfield’s work is Creative Commons and this content is free to be republished and redistributed, following the terms of the creative commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 license.
