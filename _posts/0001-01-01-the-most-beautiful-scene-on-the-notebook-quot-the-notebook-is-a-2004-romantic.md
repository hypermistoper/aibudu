{% raw %}&quot;The Notebook is a 2004 romantic drama film directed by Nick Cassavetes and written by Jeremy Leven from Jan Sardi's adaptation of the 1996 novel by Nicholas Sparks. The film stars Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as a young couple who fall in love in the 1940s. Their story is narrated from the present day by an elderly man (played by James Garner), telling the tale to a fellow nursing home resident (played by Gena Rowlands, who is Cassavetes's mother).<br /><br />The Notebook&quot; cuts between the same couple at two seasons in their lives. We see them in the urgency of young romance, and then we see them as old people, she disappearing into the shadows of Alzheimer's, he steadfast in his love. It is his custom every day to read to her from a notebook that tells the story of how they met and fell in love and faced obstacles to their happiness. Sometimes, he says, if only for a few minutes, the clouds part and she is able to remember who he is and who the story is about.&quot;<br /><br /><br />The most beautiful scene on the notebook<br />The Notebook Movie<br />The Notebook Movie Scene{% endraw %}
