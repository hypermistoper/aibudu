{% raw %}DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/PQMzurJf5w">https://discord.gg/PQMzurJf5w</a><br /><br />In this video, I got scammed three times In Minecraft on the server hypixel while playing skyblock also known as sb. I bought very expensive one for all ofa livid daggers. Instead of one of the best swords in the game the giant's swords. They are the rarest drop from floor 6 dungeons / f6. <br /><br />I lost millions of coins. In fact, I lost 400 million coins. My reaction to this was hilarious. In this video, I also wear my exotic frozen blaze armor that will be ver good for the nether update. Once it releases. <br /><br />Thanks for watching and have a nice day!{% endraw %}
