{% raw %}Lockdowns only reduced COVID-19 mortality by .2 per cent, according to a report cited by Sky News host Paul Murray.<br /><br />A recent Johns Hopkins University study of the lockdowns in the US and Europe in the spring of 2020, concluded they had little to no public health effects.<br /><br />“Surely, even those that are still the whingers and the sooks of pandemics must admit that lockdowns are the worst option,” Mr Murray said.<br /><br />“They all went on for too long, particularly in Victoria.”{% endraw %}
