{% raw %}A quick video about an unusual Sony Walkman. Can you fill in the blanks?<br /><br />UPDATE 1 - A patron found this newspaper article about the Soundalive company. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/business/firm-brings-historic-ports-heritage-4853435">https://www.getsurrey.co.uk/news/business/firm-brings-historic-ports-heritage-4853435</a><br /><br />UPDATE 2: - Here's what we've learned so far. <br />*The Soundalive! company provided a variety of narration devices for a number of locations.<br />*People remember using these devices on tours in places such as Westminster Abbey - those tapes contained narration describing details about the surroundings. <br />*It is believed that the music tapes, such as the one I used in this video were likely not used on tours, but instead were something created just to be sold in a museum gift shop. <br />*Some people who have used these devices remember them pausing at appropriate narrative gaps on the tape and it's postulated that in these cases it could have been the tape itself that somehow triggered the auto-pause feature. The listener would then restart the tape whenever they wanted to continue with the narration.  Of course it's possible that this was a feature present on a different model. With this particular machine it's not clear how a tape would trigger a pause. The tape mechanism appears just to house a standard stereo cassette play head with nothing out of the ordinary coming into contact with the tape. Output is in stereo. <br />*There are still questions surrounding about how, where and when the radio signal pause feature was implemented. It’s possible the radio interference pausing the machine  (something which can also be triggered by holding a smartphone next to the player) is just co-incidence and it’s mimicking a signal that might have been present on the narration tapes. <br />* It was questioned as to whether a period of silence could be the thing that stops the player. I checked and the machine will continuously play through a blank tape from beginning to end without pausing. So it's not this. <br /><br />--------------- SUBSCRIBE ------------------<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Techmoan?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/user/Techmoan?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />------------- Merchandise -----------------<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/techmoan-merch">https://teespring.com/stores/techmoan-merch</a><br /><br />------------- SUPPORT ---------------<br />This channel can be supported through Patreon <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/techmoan">https://www.patreon.com/techmoan</a><br />  <br />*******Patrons usually have early access to videos*******<br /><br />---------- Outro Music -----------<br />Over Time - Vibe Tracks <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/VSSswVZSgJw">https://youtu.be/VSSswVZSgJw</a><br /><br />------ Outro Sound Effect ------<br />ThatSFXGuy - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/5M3-ZV5-QDM">https://youtu.be/5M3-ZV5-QDM</a><br /><br />------ AFFILIATED LINKS/ADVERTISING NOTICE -------<br />All links are Affiliated where possible.<br />When you click on links to various merchants posted here and make a purchase, this can result in me earning a commission.
