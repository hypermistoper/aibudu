{% raw %}@Cop Watch obtained lapel footage from Española Police Department’s seizure of two cellphones belonging to Rio Arriba County, New Mexico, Sheriff James Lujan. Video shows twenty-minutes of multiple officers  asking the sheriff to comply with the search warrant.<br /><br />The case stems from two search warrants that directed them to seize his county-issued work cellphone as well as his personal phone. Twice this Spring, the Sheriff has arrived during Española Police Department's investigations. EPD Detective Ernest Saucedo discovered multiple communications using a social media service between Chacon and Española City Councilor John Ramon Vigil..<br /><br />EPD appears to have probable cause to search the Sheriff's phones to see if he was abusing his power with two cases he was involved in.<br /><br />EPD is investigating both cases and no formal charges against the Sheriff have been filed.<br /><br />***This is part 3 of a 5 part series.  Or possibly more,,,STAY TUNED!!!{% endraw %}
