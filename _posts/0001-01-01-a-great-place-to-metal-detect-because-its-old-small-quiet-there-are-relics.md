{% raw %}I got a new place to metal detect and its great because it is way out in the woods. It has a cellar hole, it is small, it is quiet and there are old relics buried in the ground. With my Fisher F19 metal detector I hit the woods and started metal detecting near the old rock walls and what was once small farm fields. Yes there was a lot of modern junk but that is always the case. I did manage to dig up some nice relics like a shoe buckle frame that is at least a couple of hundred years old. Finding old abandoned places like this old colonial farm is always a great thing but finding the stuff buried in the dirt makes it even better.<br />The official SDNT website<br />www.notthursday.com<br /><br />Charlie uses Fisher metal detectors<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.fisherlab.com">http://www.fisherlab.com</a><br />The Fisher F19 on Amazon<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L5OG3FQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00L5OG3FQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stealthdigger-20&amp;linkId=c3834ed5c6e1c769d9022d62ac0e914e">https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L5OG3FQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00L5OG3FQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=stealthdigger-20&amp;linkId=c3834ed5c6e1c769d9022d62ac0e914e</a><br /><br />Check out the Olight flashlight gear we use &amp; save $$$ with our coupon code.<br />Use the SDNT10 promo code to get 10% off the non sale items. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.olightstore.com/?streamerId=1428607417087819779&amp;channel=default">https://www.olightstore.com/?streamerId=1428607417087819779&amp;channel=default</a><br />Use the SDNT10 promo code to get 10% off the non sale items. <br /><br />Check Out the gear &amp; other items Charlie &amp; the SDNT crew recommend on Amazon<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/stealthdiggers">https://www.amazon.com/shop/stealthdiggers</a><br /><br />If you would like to be a patron of this channel by making a pledge &amp;  being a contributor to Not Thursday.<br />www.patreon.com/stealthdiggers<br />A great place to metal detect because its old small quiet &amp; there are relics<br /><br />Not Thursday hiking exploring history flashlights metal detecting New Hampshire VlOG Fisher F19 metal detector{% endraw %}
