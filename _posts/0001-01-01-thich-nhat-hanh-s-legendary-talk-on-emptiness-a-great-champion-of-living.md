{% raw %}A great champion of living and dying and a perfect incarnation of The Buddha has passed away this morning without fear or tragedy. He left those who cling to his lotus like feet lifted up in the light of Truth and he left the demons of despair and nihilism slain beneath him. You are peace Thich Nhat Hanh.{% endraw %}
