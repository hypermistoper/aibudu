{% raw %}First ride on brand new MTB trails - Sickest bike park! I ride the Isle of Wight MTB centre on my enduro bike and test out some brand new trails before riding E-foil boards, visiting a new skatepark and sending huge dirt jumps tricks!! <br /><br />You are in for a treat with this video because I made a little trip down to the Isle of Wight and squeezed in as much action as possible over the few days I was there. We start off with the brand new trails the the bike park has to offer and hit them on our enduro mountain bikes before the big opening day with a good squad before switching it up and meeting pro Kite boarder Tom Court and shredding the incredible E-foil boards! After getting dry it was then time to check out the new indoor skatepark called The Canopy which is also soon to be opened on the island. After enjoy myself to the max in the skate park on my skateboard it was time to get out the dirt jump bike and hit the infamous Lymington dirt jump spot and pull off some massive tricks with some of the best UK riders!! Which part of the video was your favorite? <br /><br />I hope you enjoy the video!<br /><br /><br /><br />LIMITED EDITION MERCH:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tothesky.store/">https://www.tothesky.store/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br /><br />Welcome to my channel, I'm a professional Freeride Mountain biker and former FMB world champion(2013).  <br /><br /><br /><br />This channel is all about Mountain biking, I make a huge variety of videos for everyone who loves dirt: From downhill biking to slower paced trials riding and everything in between like dirt jumping, slopestyle and enduro!  <br /><br /><br /><br />As well as making entertaining videos(I hope) I also like to help YOU out too, with videos such as:  <br /><br />- How to ride better <br /><br />- Trick tips and How to's <br /><br />- Travel VLOGS <br /><br />- GoPro camera tips <br /><br />- In-depth entertaining features <br /><br />- POV craziness <br /><br />- Funny videos <br /><br /><br /><br /> I also try to reply to everyone so leave some comments too!{% endraw %}
