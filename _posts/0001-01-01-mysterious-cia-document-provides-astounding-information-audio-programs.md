It‚Äôs rather complex and takes a while to digest but it‚Äôs 100% worth it.<br />It‚Äôs an official declassified CIA document and a terrific analysis of consciousness and beyond ‚Äì known as the Gateway Process.<br />While it‚Äôs an older document and declassified for a while now, the fact that modern developments in science, quantum physics, psychedelics, and neurobiology confirm what‚Äôs written within those pages is nothing short of outstanding.<br />It explains consciousness in a profound and analytical way and merges knowledge from mystics from Hindu, Buddhist, and Tibetan cultures to contemporary scientific knowledge of Planck distance, Einstein‚Äôs theory of relativity, and the works of Nils Bohr.<br />The cosmic spiral &amp; torus is everything, and everything is one. It seems as though individual consciousness is pulled from the collective consciousness using the frequency/vibrations of the being. This applies to humans, whales, fungus, and amoeba.<br />Mystics of past and present including all ancient religions understood these concepts thousands of years ago. Still, it takes much to open the minds of the most pragmatic, self-conscious, and uptight people.<br /><br />üëâüèº For more information on this topic, visit The Monroe Institute website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.monroeinstitute.org/">https://www.monroeinstitute.org/</a><br />üëâüèº Link to the document: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf">https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP96-00788R001700210016-5.pdf</a><br /><br />___________________________________________________________________________<br />Footage: Videoblocks and Artgrid<br />Music: Epidemic Sound and Audiojungle<br />References used under Fair Use Law<br />______________________________________________<br />üì© For any concerns or business inquiries, please contact us at: videoadvice@yahoo.ro<br /><br />AFFILIATE DISCLOSURE: there may be a few links in this description that, at no cost to you, will earn us a commission if you choose to click them and make a purchase.<br />Don‚Äôt worry, we only recommend products we know and trust.{% endraw %}
