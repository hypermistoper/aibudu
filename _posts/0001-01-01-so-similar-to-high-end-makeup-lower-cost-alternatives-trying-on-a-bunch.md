All other products were purchased by me. These are my own, honest opinions. Not a sponsored video - I have never accepted money from a company in exchange for a video.<br /><br />(Some items listed above are accompanied by affiliate links, meaning I earn a small commission if a purchase is made through my links. This has no impact on the cost to the consumer. I link to products this way whenever possible, and it has no bearing on the products I choose to review or recommend. I would link the products on Ulta/Sephora/whatever brand’s website anyway as a means of connecting you to further info on the products, so now it simply offers the potential for a slight financial benefit to me, which I greatly appreciate as I do not ever do sponsored videos. Feel free to use, or not use, the links provided. I do not have any coupon codes. After being asked in the comments section about links/coupon codes/how they work and why I use them, I felt like providing this explanation! Thanks!)<br /><br />Profound Thought:<br />&quot;Don't forget to love yourself.&quot; <br />-Soren Kierkegaard<br /><br />Random Thought: <br />One of my favorite things Bubba currently does... when I'm eating dinner, he comes up to me and says &quot;baby bite&quot; and then opens his mouth wide, waiting for a taste of whatever I'm having.{% endraw %}
