Before finding his calling in the operating room, Dr. Jandial was a college dropout and worked as a security guard. As a surgeon, he now provides complex surgical treatment to patients with cancer. As a scientist, his laboratory investigates the biology of the human brain. Throughout his career, he has authored 10 books and over 100 academic articles.<br /><br />His latest book, Life on a Knife’s Edge: A Brain Surgeon’s Reflections on Life, Loss and Survival, is a beautifully written account of the resilience, courage and belief he has witnessed in his patients, and the lessons about human nature he has learned from them.Ripped straight from his own personal experiences, Dr. Jandial pulls back the curtain to reveal the depth of a surgeon’s psyche that is continuously pushed to its limits.<br /><br />—<br /><br />I’m so pumped to share this episode with you all. I think it will shed a light on the things we ALL need to be focusing on more, the things we need to be worrying about less, the critical skills that will help us lead richer lives, and so much more. And now, please join me for Episode 1,249 of The School of Greatness!{% endraw %}
