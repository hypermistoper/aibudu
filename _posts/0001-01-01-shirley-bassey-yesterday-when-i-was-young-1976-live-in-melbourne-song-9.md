{% raw %}1976 - Just received from friends in Europe this much clearer (Video &amp; Sound) footage of Shirley Bassey's wonderful 1976 Melbourne Australia Concert.  This clip: Shirley Bassey performs one of her favorites from over the years, 'Yesterday When I Was Young'.   This song has been recorded by many artists over the years, but Shirley has been extremely faithful to this wonderful song.   She has regularly included it in her Concert Line-Item for 5 Decades, and counting.<br /><br />ABOUT this song:<br />It was subsequently released in English as &quot;Yesterday, When I Was Young&quot;, in Italian as &quot;Ieri Si&quot;, in Danish as &quot;Hvor tiden går&quot;, in Japanese 帰り来ぬ青春, and in Spanish as &quot;Ayer Aún&quot;. It is considered one of Aznavour's greatest hits.<br /><br />The English-language lyrics, written by Herbert Kretzmer, tell of a man reflecting on his life. He recounts how he had wasted his youth on self-centered pursuits, and that, now that he is older, he will not be able to do all that he had planned; this implies that he may be close to his impending death.   Charles Aznavour performed this song with Patrick Bruel in a live performance. This version can be heard on Aznavour's 40 chansons d'or album.<br /><br />In the United States, the best-known version was recorded by country music performer Roy Clark. His version became his biggest hit up to that time on the Billboard Hot Country Singles chart, peaking at No. 9 in August 1969, and indeed, it became his only top 40 pop hit, peaking at No. 19.    The song has been performed and recorded by many international stars, such as, Shirley Bassey, Bing Crosby, Dusty Springfield, Mel Torme, Lena Horne, Andy Williams, Jimmy Durante, Bobby Bare, Al Martino, The Peanuts, Glen Campbell, Julio Iglesias, Eddy Mitchell, Dean Reed Johnny Mathis, Marc Almond, Patricia Kaas, Nora Aunor, etc., and an uptempo version by Blossom Dearie. According to Billboard, more than 90 versions of the song were recorded before 1972{% endraw %}
