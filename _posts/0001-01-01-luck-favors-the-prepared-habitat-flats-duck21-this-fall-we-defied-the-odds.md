{% raw %}This fall, we defied the odds. We took all the lemons Mother Nature could throw at us and made sparkling lemonade. And I couldn't be more proud to to say that. Because we EARNED it. Did we have those big, beautiful bunches I love so much? Not often, not really at all. Lots of singles and pairs. But we made it happen. We scratched out hunts and then we did it again the next day.<br /><br />The Off Season work isn't for the days it comes easy. That grueling 6 months is for the seasons like this one: the massively unpredictable. A fall season that largely felt like spring, or even Teal Season at times. We took unfavorable conditions at every turn and made them into solid hunts. I won't soon forget the Fall of 2021 - and I'll use it as the ultimate motivation during the many sweltering summer days ahead full of issues and obstacles. It's all for moments like these.{% endraw %}
