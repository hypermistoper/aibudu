Why does this demonic, horned Yuletide monster exist? This episode looks at the historical origins of Krampus in the winter festivals of the Alpine region, challenging the false claim that this monster came from pagan tradition, and traces its renewed popularity across the globe. #Krampus #Christmas #folklore #MonstrumPBS<br /><br />Written and Hosted by: Dr. Emily Zarka<br />Director: David Schulte<br />Executive Producer: Amanda Fox<br />Producer: Stephanie Noone<br />Illustrator: Samuel Allen<br />Editor: Nicole Kopren<br />Produced by Spotzen for PBS Digital Studios. <br /><br />The world is full of monsters, myths, and legends and Monstrum isn’t afraid to take a closer look.
