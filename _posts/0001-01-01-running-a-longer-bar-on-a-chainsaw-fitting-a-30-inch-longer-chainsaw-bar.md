{% raw %}Fitting a 30 Inch Longer Chainsaw Bar to my Stihl MS 391. The MS 391 has the 20 Inch Bar standard and 3.3 KW of power.  <br />Will it run the Longer Bar? How will it Cut? Will it be effective? The Stihl Farm Boss MS 391 is a Medium Sized Chainsaw and was perfect for my Previous Property where the trees were all a smaller size. My new property has some much Larger Eucalyptus Long Leaf Peppermint Trees that I am cutting up for Firewood this Winter. <br />I Cut some large diameter Rounds of firewood  with the Longer 30 Inch Bar with Full Chisel Skip Tooth 3/8 Chain, Split them with my Fiskars X27 and bing the firewood back to my house with the Land Rover Series 2a. <br />I find out if you can fit the longer bar to your chainsaw.<br /><br />Ebay Link to This Chainsaw Bar<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/705-53470-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&amp;ipn=icep&amp;toolid=20004&amp;campid=5338533947&amp;mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com.au%2Fitm%2F30-CHAINSAW-BAR-for-STIHL-3-8-063-FULL-CHISEL-SKIP-TOOTH-CHAIN-PRO-NOSE%2F232450257018%3FssPageName%3DSTRK%253AMEBIDX%253AIT%26_trksid%3Dp2060353.m1438.l2649">https://rover.ebay.com/rover/1/705-53470-19255-0/1?icep_id=114&amp;ipn=icep&amp;toolid=20004&amp;campid=5338533947&amp;mpre=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com.au%2Fitm%2F30-CHAINSAW-BAR-for-STIHL-3-8-063-FULL-CHISEL-SKIP-TOOTH-CHAIN-PRO-NOSE%2F232450257018%3FssPageName%3DSTRK%253AMEBIDX%253AIT%26_trksid%3Dp2060353.m1438.l2649</a>{% endraw %}
