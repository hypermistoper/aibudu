{% raw %}Sky News host Rita Panahi says Donald Trump and anyone with a “functioning frontal cortex” knew the dangers of what would happen if Russia was allowed to become an energy superpower.<br /><br />“Whether President Trump was warning about the dangers of becoming dependent on Russian oil and gas or warning NATO members that they had to spend more to properly protect their countries and region from the likes of Russia, the media continued to mock and malign him,” she said. <br /><br />“Russia now accounts for 65 per cent of Germany's natural gas imports. <br /><br />“Germany closed its nuclear power plants and now hands over billions to Russia.”<br /><br />Ms Panahi said the majority of Americans believe Russian President Vladimir Putin would not have invaded Ukraine if Mr Trump was still in the White House, and the others in the poll were either “lying or stupid”.<br /><br />“Yes, according to a new Harvard-Harris Poll released Friday, 62 percent of Americans believe Putin would not be moving against Ukraine if Trump was still in the White House,” she said. <br /><br />“Do you miss him yet? Do you regret falling for the fake hysteria pushed by the media that Trump was a danger to world peace, that he was going to start world wars and usher in an age of violence and conflict?<br /><br />“The truth is far from starting World War III, Trump engineered multiple peace treaties in the Middle East and implemented policies that weakened Russia and China, and he did it all while whilst being maligned as some Russian puppet.”{% endraw %}
