{% raw %}The UK Antarctic Heritage Trust is looking for people to work in their post office and museum at the Port Lockroy base in Antarctica. You’ll work 7 days a week, with days off every 2 weeks. It will be physically taxing labor “in a remote and potentially dangerous place.” The job is five months long in a place where there will be no internet access, no running water, and freezing temperatures. But despite that, the Antarctic Heritage Trust says hundreds of people apply each year.{% endraw %}
