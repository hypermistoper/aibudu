{% raw %}ðŸ‘‡ Learn the story of this video, and find some links that may interest you<br /><br />I went to Santa Monica, CA to ask random people to sing with me for my series called &quot;Sing With Me.&quot; That's when I met Shirin!<br /><br />Shirin was just on her regular jog when she saw me with my sign that says &quot;Sing With Me.&quot; With enthusiasm, she picked a song to sing, and we did it! But I didn't want us to stop there. We continued to sing together and create a happy inspiring musical experience that we will never forget. Good thing we recorded it because now we get to share it with you!<br /><br />As a musician, I'm all about creating musical experiences that have people feeling happy and free, and that's why the &quot;Sing With Me&quot; series exists. Since 2018, I have asked thousands of random people to sing with me on camera. A lot of people have said no, some have said no initially but changed their minds to yes, and some have said yes right away. I ask these people to sing with one purpose: to create a way for them to experience a sense of happiness and freedom they did not feel before. And much of the time, this actually works (and that makes ME happy).<br /><br /><br />â–º Get the Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/guitaro-5000-store">https://teespring.com/stores/guitaro-5000-store</a><br /><br />Consider a $10 donation in my virtual tip jar.
