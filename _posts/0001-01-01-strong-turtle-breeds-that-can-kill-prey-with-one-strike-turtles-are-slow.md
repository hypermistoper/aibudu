{% raw %}Turtles are slow and boring to watch. Wrong! Sometimes, turtles can be exciting to watch,  especially when they’re snapping turtles. Have you ever seen a turtle attack a snake? What about a horse? If you want to see turtles in action, keep watching, as we look at strong turtle breeds that  can kill prey with one strike<br /><br />► Subscribe For New Videos! ►  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/UpeqAc">https://goo.gl/UpeqAc</a> <br /><br />Watch our “Strange Behaviors By Savage Hunters Towards Their Prey”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/6vXTsaumCDk">https://youtu.be/6vXTsaumCDk</a><br />Watch our “Animals Teaching Each Other Unforgettable Brutal Lessons”<br />video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/lgdKahA_d2A">https://youtu.be/lgdKahA_d2A</a><br />Watch our “Insane Moments Of Predators Going Crazy While Hunting”<br />video here:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/7vFACQC38rI">https://youtu.be/7vFACQC38rI</a><br /><br />Red Eared Slider Turtle<br /><br />This turtle finds a potato bug on its path, and it tries to grab it. Another turtle joins the quest, and they both take shots at the bug, eventually turning it into a hardy meal, for the two pugilists.  This potato bug has been parachuted into this aquarium after being found in a pool. It serves as lunch for this hungry turtle. The potato bug is not much of a challenge for the turtle.  Turtles are omnivores and this little thing is a rare treat for this turtle. <br /><br />The turtle, with its head sticking out of the water, salivates over its prey before going for the kill. The cricket runs, but the turtle follows, slowly. When the cricket ends up in the water, the turtle snatches it.  These turtles are voracious eaters. We can see one attacking a frog this time. That’s a big frog when you take the turtle’s size into consideration, but the turtle doesn’t care, because it’s probably going to chop it into small pieces before it eats it. When the turtle finally grabs the frog,  it tears half of its body, which kills the frog. <br /><br />Baboons Save Baby Impala From Leopard/Cheetah<br /><br />A goldfish is being chased by this turtle, but it won’t get very far. The turtle kills the fish and rips it apart in seconds.  This turtle has the pick of the litter when all these goldfish swim for their lives. The turtle eats fish after fish until it is full. <br /><br />Sometimes it tears off the head of the fish and other times it just gobbles them up.   I’m not sure this tiny fish is going to be enough for these three famished turtles, but it looks like that’s all they have to eat for the time being. There’s probably more coming, but they don’t know this.<br /><br />For copyright matters please contact <br /><br />Background Music:  Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a><br /><br />Thank you so much for watching!
