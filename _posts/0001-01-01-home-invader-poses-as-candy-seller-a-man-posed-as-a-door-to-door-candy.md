{% raw %}A man posed as a door-to-door candy seller before a brazen home invasion caught on surveillance camera in Stockton, California. When the homeowner opened the door to buy a box of candy, three men came out of nowhere and burst into the home as the woman inside screamed in terror. The man posing as a candy seller then took off. Earlier that day, a neighborâ€™s security camera caught the same candy seller trying to pull the same stunt. But this time, the homeowner refused to open the door.{% endraw %}
