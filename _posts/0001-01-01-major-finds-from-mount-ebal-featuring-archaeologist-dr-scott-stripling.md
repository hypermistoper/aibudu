{% raw %}On the second steppe on the east side of Mt. Ebal at the el-Burnat site, Adam Zertal excavated two altars. He found that a large rectangular altar covered an earlier and smaller round altar. The rectangular altar has garnered much attention, but it is the round altar that dates to the time of Joshua 8:30, the late 15th century B.C. In December 2019 and January 2020, Archaeologist Dr. Scott Stripling led an expedition to wet sift Zertalâ€™s dump piles. The finds were of enormous importance and will be presented in the lecture.{% endraw %}
