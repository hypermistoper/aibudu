{% raw %}A spin class had an unexpected end for a 24-year-old when she hopped off the bike at the end of class and realized she could barely walk. She had a rare, exercise-induced condition but she had no idea yet. Kaelyn Franco, a lifelong athlete, collapsed on the floor after participating in an intense indoor cycling class. She made it home after the class, but said she was in extreme pain and couldnâ€™t bend her legs. She went to the hospital, where she ended up having emergency surgery to save her leg.{% endraw %}
