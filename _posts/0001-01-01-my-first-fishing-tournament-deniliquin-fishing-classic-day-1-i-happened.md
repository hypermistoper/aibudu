{% raw %}I happened to get a free entry into the 2022 Deniliquin Fishing Classic for being one of the many sponsors and unlike past years, made the decision to participate and it was the right decision.<br /><br />We got to many some fabulous people over 3 nights and two days on the Edward River, including D'Mac Fishing, who also has a terrific Youtube channel which you can find here : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/mrd51171">https://www.youtube.com/user/mrd51171</a><br /><br />This is all the highlights from Day of the tournament, enjoy!<br /><br />Music By:  Bensound.com{% endraw %}
