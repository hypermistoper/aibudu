Uniquely, it does not follow a storyline; rather it presents each player with the challenge of simply existing in the blocky wilderness alongside a wide array of livestock and monsters.  From infiltrating undersea fortresses to visiting alternate dimensions, it’s tough to run out of activities in this vast game. <br /><br />Music: &quot;My Money Don’t Jiggle Jiggle, It Folds&quot; by Louis Theroux<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_4IrammcVA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_4IrammcVA</a><br />Produced by Duke &amp; Jones:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSfRRBNPfFs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSfRRBNPfFs</a><br /><br />Concept and animation by Samuel Choy<br /><br />THIS IS A FAN-MADE ANIMATION.
