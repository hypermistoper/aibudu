{% raw %}Hello, in this video it is more of a Swedish vlog. As we are at a basketball camp, we are having a lot of un and this is a very upbeat and hectic vlog of the events of this weekend. I had a lot of fun editing this, picking the music that fit, the music that fit a kind of running or workout esc video but more of a basketball format. This is very all over the place as we get lost a lot and wonder if we even are in Europe anymore?. <br />Det var en j√§tte rolig video och filma och redigera, hoppas den √§r rolig att kolla p√•!<br />#basketball #sweden #YouTube #vlog #fun #friends #basketballweekend #spring #viral{% endraw %}
