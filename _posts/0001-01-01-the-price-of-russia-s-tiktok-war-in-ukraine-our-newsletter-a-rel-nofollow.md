And yes, I know this is a sensitive topic. But I wanted to cover an aspect of this almost nobody is talking about.<br /><br />Look, I know. There are a lot of things I could talk about when it comes to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, but I wouldn't be saying anything that hasn't already been said 10,000 times already. It's a tragedy, and my heart goes out to the people of Ukraine. But it isn't my place to talk about aspects of this war I'm not well versed in.<br /><br />With that in mind, I'm sticking to my lane and focusing on some of the economic impacts of Russia's war in Ukraine. And how it's likely going to affect you.<br /><br />As a side note, any revenue generated from this video is going to be donated to refugees fleeing the war in Ukraine.<br /><br />If you've got any comments, leave them below.<br /><br />0:00 - The Russian invasion of Ukraine<br />1:36 - The price of war<br />2:28 - How sanctions are damaging Russia<br />4:14 - Russia's oil woes from war<br />6:33 - Natural gas and Russia<br />7:40 - Is there any good that can come from this?<br />8:01 - We're all connected<br /> <br />‚ñ∫ IMPORTANT LINKS:<br />Enter your email below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abundantia.co/">https://www.abundantia.co/</a><br /><br />‚ñ∫ SOCIAL MEDIA:<br />‚Ä¢ Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/">https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/</a><br />‚Ä¢ Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/sorelleamore">https://instagram.com/sorelleamore</a><br />‚Ä¢ Abundantia Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/abundantiaco">https://twitter.com/abundantiaco</a><br />‚Ä¢ Abundantia Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance">http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance</a><br /><br />Sorelle and Leon.<br />Founders, Abundantia<br /><br />Liability Disclaimer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer">https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer</a><br />*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.
