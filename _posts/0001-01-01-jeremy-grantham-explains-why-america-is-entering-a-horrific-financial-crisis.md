{% raw %}Our Commentary - Wall Street titan Jeremy Grantham has been warning of a “Super Bubble” in the U.S. since last year, arguing the S&amp;P 500 is set to be cut in half as an era marked by exceedingly risky investor behavior begins to fade. So far, his prediction about the S&amp;P 500 has proved to be prescient, if a little dramatic, as the index is now down roughly 20% year to date. Stocks, particularly in the once high-flying tech sector, have been hammered as the Federal Reserve continues to raise interest rates in hopes of combating levels of inflation not seen in four decades. Grantham is also warning that the U.S. may be headed toward a housing crisis as mortgage rates soar, and the effects on the economy could be devastating. Grantham’s thesis is that US stocks are in a “Super Bubble”, an upgrade on last year’s diagnosis of “an epic bubble”, and that the US has seen only three other such extreme events in the past 100 years – the Wall Street crash of 1929, the turn-of-the-millennium dot-com mania and the housing market madness of 2006. All those three super bubbles went through the specific events which triggered the super bubble burst and now all those episodes are over, Grantham reckoned, and we’re on to “the vampire phase” of the bull market, Grantham says. Grantham hasn’t always right, but he is a serious student of markets who called the dot-com and 2006-08 crashes with impressive precision. So, he is worth listening to.
