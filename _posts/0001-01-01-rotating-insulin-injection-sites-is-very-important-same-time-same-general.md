{% raw %}Same Time, Same General Location<br />Insulin is absorbed at different speeds depending on where you inject, so it's best to consistently use the same part of the body for each of your daily injections. For example, do not inject your lunch bolus dose in the abdomen on Monday and in the thigh on Tuesday. If you have picked the thigh for your evening injection, then continue to use the thigh for all of your evening injections.According to Eli Lilly, the leading manufacturer of insulin, most insulin enters the blood:<br />Fastest from the abdomen (stomach)<br />A little slower from the arms<br />Even slower from the legs<br />Slowest from the buttocksRotate Within an Injection Site<br />To avoid developing hard lumps and fat deposits, it is important to inject in different spots within a general part of the body.<br />Change sides within an area. For example, if you inject your evening insulin in the thigh, try using the right thigh one evening, and the left thigh the next evening. <br /> <br />You might find it useful to picture the face of a clock on your abdomen. That helps you to keep each of your injections at least one finger’s width from the last injection.<br /><br />Let’s say that you inject four times a day, and all of the injections are in your abdomen. Look down at your abdomen and picture “Noon” below your belly button. Place your first injection at Noon, your second injection at 1 o’clock, the third injection at 2 o’clock, and the fourth injection at 3 o’clock. You will not come back to the “Noon” spot again until day 4, which gives that spot a chance to rest.{% endraw %}
