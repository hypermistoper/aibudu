{% raw %}Canyon Strive Review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://flowmountainbike.com/tests/canyon-strive-review-cfr-2022/">https://flowmountainbike.com/tests/canyon-strive-review-cfr-2022/</a><br /><br />The all-new 4th generation Canyon Strive has arrived, bringing with it some hefty changes that are designed to turn up the dial on the enduro race track.<br /><br />You might recall that when the last generation Strive arrived back in 2019, it was actually Canyon's first long travel 29er. As such, it was built to be a bit of an all-rounder and not just a flat-out race bike. Since then however, Canyon has introduced both the Spectral 29 and the Torque 29, and that's opened the door for the new Strive to let off the brakes and commit to going Full Enduro™. But is that necessarily a good thing?<br /><br />Having spent a load of time on the current Strive, we've thoroughly enjoyed its balance handling and versatile suspension performance. So just how different is this new bike then?<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Canyon Strive Video Contents<br /><br />0:00​​​​ - Canyon Strive Overview<br />0:42 - The Shapeshifter<br />1:11 - Geometry Updates<br />2:25 - Canyon Strive Price &amp; Specs<br />2:56 - Canyon Strive Weight<br />3:19 - Canyon Strive Size Chart &amp; Fit<br />4:02 - Strengths<br />6:20 - Weaknesses<br />7:49 - But Wait, There's More!<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Love mountain biking?
