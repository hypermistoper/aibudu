I couldn't believe some of the things I saw in this video. We talked about the world's tallest man, the largest mouth gape, the shortest woman, the most joints cracked consecutively, the thinnest waist, highest and lowest notes ever sang, the oldest woman, the longest plank, longest nose, and most cups stuck to a head, among other things! Which did you find the most incredible?<br /><br />I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously.
