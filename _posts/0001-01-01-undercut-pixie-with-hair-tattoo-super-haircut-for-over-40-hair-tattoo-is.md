{% raw %}Hair tattoo is a shaving design, which is incorporated into women’s undercut hairstyles. Back tattoos are the best for pixies.   It is a great alternative to ink head tattoos and looks great with any hair length. It can be geometric, with a flower design, and even with a realistic portrait. Can be done by various techniques, most often with razors or edging clippers.<br />When choosing your new hair tattoo, think of how it’s going to blend with your chosen hairstyle. Nape tattoos are popular among women who love to wear updos – ponytails, top knots, buns, etc. <br />Trading in needles and ink for clippers and dye, hair tattoo looks set the best badass hair trend to try without the pain and lifetime commitment to the real thing. Ready for any hair length, short coifs show off your design all day, every day, while longer styles have the power to keep them covered when you want.
