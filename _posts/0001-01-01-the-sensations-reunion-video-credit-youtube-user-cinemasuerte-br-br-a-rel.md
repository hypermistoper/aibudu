One of the original Philippine movie queens, she rose up to become the versatile actress that has been given the fitting title of &quot;Star for All Seasons&quot; because of her capacity to adapt to the changing mores and values of the Filipino woman, giving a face to their plight and struggles, albeit in success both critically and box-office wise in some of Philippine cinema's classics such as Trudis Liit (1963), Lipad, Darna, Lipad (1973), Burlesk Queen (1977), Relasyon (1982), Sister Stella L. (1984), Alyas Baby Tsina (1984), Pahiram ng Isang Umaga (1989), Dahil Mahal Kita: The Dolzura Cortez Story (1993), Anak (2000) and Dekada '70 (2002).  She is currently in politics as the governor of Batangas, Philippines (Wikipedia).
