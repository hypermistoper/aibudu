{% raw %}Today's episode is a great keynote I had in the city of Atlanta last month. I talk a lot about kindness in life and in business and how true kindness comes in the face of adversity. If you can be kind to someone who has done you wrong, then you are doing it right. I also discuss accountability, pinning the blame on others and much more that I know you'll get a ton of value from.<br /><br />Enjoy!
