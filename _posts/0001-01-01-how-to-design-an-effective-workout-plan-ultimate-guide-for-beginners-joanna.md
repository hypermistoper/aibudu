You can’t just have a goal and expect to achieve it, if you don’t have a clear and detailed plan. Without it, you’re probably wasting your time and effort. <br /><br />There isn’t a “one plan fits all” solution. That’s because we are all different. Creating an exercise programme varies based on your age, goal, fitness level, lifestyle and more. Even with tons of workout videos out there, you still need to have the knowledge of knowing why you’re doing this workout, rather than just blindly following it..<br /><br />So what I’ll be sharing with you today are the foundations to start a simple yet effective workout programme. It might sound daunting, but once you know the basics and build from there, it isn’t difficult, in fact it’s a lot of fun. I’m going to try to keep it really simple and break it down into 5 steps. Watch this video to learn more!<br /><br />Step 1 - Consistency (How often and when should I workout?)<br />Step 2 - Variety (What workouts should I do?)<br />Step 3 - Volume (How many sets, reps and rest time?)<br />Step 4 - Progression (How do I keep progressing and avoid plateau?)<br />Step 5 - Track (Why should I track my workouts?)<br /><br />________________<br /><br />Weight Loss Tips: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyP8pbBMxcsjSQjf_2V8ZJku_njMfh_Zm">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyP8pbBMxcsjSQjf_2V8ZJku_njMfh_Zm</a><br /><br />Weight Loss Meal Plan &amp; Recipes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyP8pbBMxcsiVZKn2idlOzVppEmkQuXBp">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyP8pbBMxcsiVZKn2idlOzVppEmkQuXBp</a><br /><br />Abs &amp; Core Workout: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyP8pbBMxcsi0MwwHzR5tWUjphLt7vt5q">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyP8pbBMxcsi0MwwHzR5tWUjphLt7vt5q</a><br /><br />Crazy Workout Challenges: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=g83v1m2P4_g&amp;list=PLyP8pbBMxcsgw079OkBK0o-sjKzX4qE0Jm">https://youtube.com/watch?v=g83v1m2P4_g&amp;list=PLyP8pbBMxcsgw079OkBK0o-sjKzX4qE0Jm</a><br /><br />________________<br /><br />Record a video or take a picture of you doing the workout, tag me @JoannaSohOfficial #JSohActive <br /><br />I'm a certified Personal Trainer (ACE), Women’s Fitness Specialist (NASM) and Nutrition Coach, with over 10 years of experience.<br /><br />Stay connected and follow me:<br />Joanna Soh:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://joannasoh.com/">http://joannasoh.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/joannasohofficial/">https://www.instagram.com/joannasohofficial/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/joannasohofficial/">https://www.facebook.com/joannasohofficial/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/joannasohofficial">https://www.youtube.com/user/joannasohofficial</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Joanna_Soh">https://twitter.com/Joanna_Soh</a><br />(Subscribe to my website for printable workouts &amp; recipes)<br /><br />My Fitness App<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/fio.app">https://www.instagram.com/fio.app</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/fioapp">https://www.facebook.com/fioapp</a><br />________________<br /><br />How to Design an Effective Workout Plan: Ultimate Guide for Beginners | Joanna Soh{% endraw %}
