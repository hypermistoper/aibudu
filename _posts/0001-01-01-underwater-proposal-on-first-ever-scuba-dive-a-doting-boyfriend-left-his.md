{% raw %}A doting boyfriend left his scuba diver girlfriend completely shellshocked during what she believed was his first dive – pulling out a ring and PROPOSING UNDERWATER. In the beautiful footage, Hayley O’Brien can be seen getting increasingly flabbergasted as her boyfriend, Tim Collins, pulls back the pages on a laminated book, explaining his love for her before presenting her with a ring. What made the moment even more of a shock for Hayley, who was celebrating her 26th birthday that day, was that she believed this was Tim’s first-ever dive – but it was actually a plan long in the making. As part of Hayley’s birthday celebrations, Tim, also 26, promised his girlfriend, a licensed scuba diver, that he undertake an introductory scuba course, in Nelson Bay, New South Wales, Australia. But little did Hayley know, three weeks earlier, Tim had practiced for his June 8 proposal elsewhere – meaning he could arrange for a videographer to capture the moment on the day of Hayley’s birthday. <br /><br />----<br /><br />Happily is home to feel good news guaranteed to put a smile on your face.
