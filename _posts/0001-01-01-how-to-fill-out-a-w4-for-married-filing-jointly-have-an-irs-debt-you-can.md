{% raw %}Have an IRS debt you can't seem to get under control? Book a no obligation tax relief evaluation here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bookingbowens.as.me/taxrelief">https://bookingbowens.as.me/taxrelief</a> <br /><br />Filing out a W4 is a rite of passage to working. Yet, HR departments can't show you how to do it properly and as a result it is often done incorrectly. <br /><br />One of the FAQ that I receive are about filling out a W4 properly. Often times I see taxpayers with multiple jobs and/or a family where both spouses work outside of the home end up owing the IRS. <br /><br />This isn't due to any intentional negligence but simply from them being uninformed on how to do it any better. This video is for those families. I walk you step by step through how to fill out a 2021 W4, specifically a 2021 W4 for a married couple filing jointly.<br /><br /> I will show you how to use the table on page 4 to make sure that you have the correct additional amount of tax withheld. Avoid owing the IRS with this simple remedy, filling out your W4 properly.<br /><br /> This example shows what each spouse will put on their form but does not cover dependents or itemized deductions.<br /><br /> Keep in mind that the purpose of this form is to make sure that withholding is as accurate as possible, meaning that you keep more of your money throughout the year instead of a big refund during tax time.<br /><br /> If you'd like for me to do a video on how to figure your estimated payments as a sole proprietor/single member LLC let me know in the comments!
