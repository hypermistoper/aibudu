Russia's defence ministry said on March 25, its most recent update, that 1,351 Russian soldiers had been killed since the start of the campaign, and 3,825 had been wounded.<br /><br />In Brussels, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba met with foreign ministers of the NATO alliance, the European Union, Finland, Sweden, Japan, New Zealand and Australia today.
