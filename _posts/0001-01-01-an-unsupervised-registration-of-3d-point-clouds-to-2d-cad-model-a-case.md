Sohn<br />DOI:doi:10.5194/isprs-annals-V-2-2020-9-2020<br />Description: <br />Thanks to the proliferation of commodity 3D devices such as HoloLens, one can have easy access to the 3D model of indoor building objects. However, this model does not match 2D available computer-aided design (CAD) models as the as-built model.  To address this problem, in this study, a 3-step registration method is proposed. First, binary images, including walls and background, are generated for the 3D point cloud (PC) and the 2D CAD model. Then, 2D-to-2D corresponding pixels (CPs) are extracted based on the intersection of walls in each binary image of PC (BIPC) and binary CAD (BCAD) model. Since the 3D PC space coordinates (XYZ) of all BIPC's pixels are known, BIPC part of the 2D-to-2D CPs can be considered 3D. Lastly, the parameters of the 8-parameter affine are estimated using the 2D-to-3D CPs, which are pixel coordinates in BCAD model as well as their correspondences in the 3D PC space. Experimental results indicate the efficiency of our proposed method compared to manual registration.{% endraw %}
