{% raw %}One of the holy grails of Fairport Convention video.  In 1975, BBC TV produced a version of Fairport's “Babbacombe” Lee for the series 2nd House, entitling it The Man They Could Not Hang. It was recorded on September 24, 1974 and broadcast on February 1, 1975. This featured narration by Melvyn Bragg, broadsides by Martin Carthy, and most of the songs from the record (with a few besides) by an unusual Fairport line-up consisting of Dave Swarbrick, Jerry Donahue, Simon Nicol, Dave Pegg and Dave Mattacks.<br /><br />Written and produced by Mark Kidel.<br /><br />This video is taken from the slightly shorter repeat which omitted a version of Breakfast In Mayfair with Sandy Denny on most lead vocals.  I originally thought the song was audio-only on the program but consensus is that it was in fact a performance video, making the decision to remove it from the repeat a most unfortunate one. It does at least appear on later reissues of the Babbacombe Lee CD, some compilations etc.<br /><br />Band sections recorded at one of the machinery rooms in the sub-basement of the Chalk Farm Roundhouse.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fairportconvention.com/">http://fairportconvention.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Babbacombe_Lee">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Babbacombe_Lee</a>{% endraw %}
