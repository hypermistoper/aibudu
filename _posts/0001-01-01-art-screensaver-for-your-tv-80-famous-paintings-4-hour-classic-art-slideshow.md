{% raw %}Turn your TV into a beautiful piece of art with this 4 hour art screensaver for your flatscreen. This slideshow includes 80 famous paintings, each spaced 3 minutes apart with no sound. Feel free to use this for parties, interior design, or your own enjoyment/entertainment. For a few seconds at the beginning of each painting, I include the title and artist. This information can also be found in the timestamps throughout the video. The artwork zooms slightly to reduce the risk of burn-in to your TV.
