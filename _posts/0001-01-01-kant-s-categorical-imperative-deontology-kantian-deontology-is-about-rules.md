{% raw %}Kantian deontology is about rules and duties. Kant argued for an ultimate moral principle called The Categorical Imperative. It says that one must only act on principles (or &quot;maxims&quot;) that could be universalized. This means they must still be rational even if everyone were to use them.<br /><br />Intro: (0:00)<br />The Categorical Imperative: (0:43)<br />What is a Maxim?: (1:22)<br />A Maxim as a Universal Law: (2:06)<br />Testing the Maxim: (2:33)<br />What Kant is NOT Saying: (3:32)<br />Conclusion: (4:00)<br /><br />Stock Media Sources: FreePik (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.freepik.com​)">https://www.freepik.com​)</a> [including MacroVector], Pixabay (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pexels.com​),">https://www.pexels.com​),</a> Pexels (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pixabay.com​),">https://www.pixabay.com​),</a> <br />Purple Planet (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.purple-planet.com​),">https://www.purple-planet.com​),</a> ZapSplat (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.zapsplat.com​)">https://www.zapsplat.com​)</a>{% endraw %}
