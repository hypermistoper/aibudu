{% raw %}In this talk, Avinash recounts one of his toughest days in the military and the lessons he learned that continue to help him withstand the rain, rocks, and dirt that life throws his way. Join him on this adventure through the jungle to uncover what it means to be emotionally resilient. Avinash is a Singaporean student undergoing a BSc in Politics and Economics at the LSE. Prior to pursuing his undergraduate degree, Avinash served two years in the Singaporean Army, during which he overcame significant hurdles regarding being overweight and dealing with unpredictability. Along his journey towards officership, and ultimately a healthy lifestyle, Avinash learned crucial lessons about resilience in the face of uncertainty that he was determined to share on a wider stage at TEDxLSE.
