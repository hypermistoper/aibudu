{% raw %}David was a man who chose to live according to God’s plan and schedule. David waited 14 years to become king and spent most of that time in hiding. Dr. Stanley reveals the biblical reasons why we ought to follow David’s example. We’ll never be disappointed if we choose to wait on the Lord.<br /> <br />Instead of becoming impatient, nervous, or frustrated, God wants us to wait patiently, quietly, and courageously.<br /><br />For more messages from Charles Stanley, including this week's broadcast, go to intouch.org/tv.{% endraw %}
