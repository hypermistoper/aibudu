{% raw %}#SFM #FNAF #FiveNightsAtFreddys<br />It's been 2 long years and a half since my last solo project, I've been busy working and porting models, BUT, I'm back and today I bring you this new animation on GatoPaint's Prevails song!<br />The story is simple, this animation tries to bring back the old FNaF days when Help Wanted didn't exist and Glitchtrap wasn't a thing, when William Afton was a simple yet mysterious man who killed a bunch of children and stuffed them in some robotic animals.<br />William's usual enemy is Golden Freddy/Cassidy, but this time he has a lot more to deal with. They won't let him rest and they'll bring him to his grave.<br /><br />Credits:<br />GatoPaint for creating the song: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqiraBMK5Jvc3eB-2sXnA0Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqiraBMK5Jvc3eB-2sXnA0Q</a><br /><br />General help and support:<br />Rudy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/dudesavageeee">https://www.youtube.com/c/dudesavageeee</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/duderudyy">https://twitter.com/duderudyy</a><br />Sweezo: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoUhnbHxQODgYIxgpMFIXrA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoUhnbHxQODgYIxgpMFIXrA</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Sweezo_SFM">https://twitter.com/Sweezo_SFM</a><br /><br />Providing models:<br />T.M.: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbu2mz9xbEUJtYYa9nlbehA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCbu2mz9xbEUJtYYa9nlbehA</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tm_animations">https://twitter.com/tm_animations</a><br />Mountroid: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Mountroid">https://www.youtube.com/c/Mountroid</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mountroid">https://twitter.com/mountroid</a><br /><br />Lefty's voice impression at the end of the animation was made by<br />Binaphobia: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Binaphobia">https://twitter.com/Binaphobia</a><br /><br />Go check all these people out!
