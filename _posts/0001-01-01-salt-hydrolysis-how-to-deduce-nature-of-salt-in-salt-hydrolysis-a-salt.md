{% raw %}A salt can be acidic, neutral or alkaline.<br /><br />We can deduce the nature of the salt from its constituent ions, namely:<br /><br />1. ion formed from a weak acid will be a conjugate base, eg CH3COO- (from weak acid CH3COOH)<br /><br />2. ion formed from a strong acid will be neutral, eg Cl- (from strong acid HCl)<br /><br />3. ion formed from a weak base will be a conjugate acid, eg NH4+ (from weak base NH3)<br /><br />4. ion formed from a strong base will be neutral, eg Na+ (from strong base NaOH)<br /><br />This can be summarised as shown:<br /><br />salt hydrolysis nature of ions summary<br /><br />Next we can move on to deduce the nature of a salt.<br /><br />Let's have some examples.<br /><br />1. Sodium chloride NaCl is neutral<br />What we do is simply just deduce the nature of each constituent ion based on the acid or base that forms that ion.<br /><br />salt hydrolysis sodium chloride neutral<br /><br />Na+ is neutral since it is formed from strong base NaOH<br /><br />Cl- is neutral since it is formed from strong acid HCl<br /><br />Since both cation and anion are neutral, NaCl must be neutral.<br /><br />2. Sodium ethanoate CH3COONa is alkaline<br />salt hydrolysis sodium ethanoate is alkaline<br /><br />Na+ is neutral since it is formed from strong base NaOH.<br /><br />CH3COO- is alkaline since it is the conjugate base of weak acid CH3COOH.<br /><br />Since we have a conjugate base, CH3COO- will dissociate in water to give OH-, hence the salt is alkaline.<br /><br />3. Ammonium chloride NH4Cl is acidic<br />salt hydrolysis ammonium chloride is acidic<br /><br />Cl- is neutral since it is formed from strong acid HCl.<br /><br />NH4+ is acidic since it is the conjugate acid of weak base NH3.<br /><br />Since we have a conjugate acid, NH4+ will dissociate in water to give H+, hence the salt is acidic.<br /><br />Watch this video to learn an easy way to understand salt hydrolysis, a concept that students often find confusing in Ionic Equilibria!<br /><br />Topic: Ionic Equilibria, Physical Chemistry, A Level Chemistry, Singapore<br /><br />You can also view this video lesson with screenshots and detailed explanation at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chemistryguru.com.sg/salt-hydrolysis-how-to-deduce-nature-of-salt">https://chemistryguru.com.sg/salt-hydrolysis-how-to-deduce-nature-of-salt</a><br /><br />Do check out the following for more video lessons:<br />Physical Chemistry Videos at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chemistryguru.com.sg/a-level-physical-chemistry-video-lessons">https://chemistryguru.com.sg/a-level-physical-chemistry-video-lessons</a><br />A Level Chemistry Videos at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://chemistryguru.com.sg/a-level-chemistry-video-lessons">https://chemistryguru.com.sg/a-level-chemistry-video-lessons</a><br /><br />If you are looking for H2 Chemistry Tuition, do consider taking up my classes at Bishan.
