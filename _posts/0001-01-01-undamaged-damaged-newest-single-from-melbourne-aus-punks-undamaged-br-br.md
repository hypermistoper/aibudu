Check us out on facebook - <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/undamaged.band/">https://www.facebook.com/undamaged.band/</a><br /><br />1, 2!<br /><br />I didn't want to feel dead inside but this worlds' left me desensitized<br />Now I'm walking through this life waiting to die<br />The only place I feel safe to hide are the dark corners of my mind<br />And now the demons in me are worse than outside<br /><br />I can feel them coming down on me<br />The walls are closing in, I can't breathe<br />This aint no fucking joke - leave me alone!!<br />I'm running out of ways to fucking cope<br /><br />I didn't want to feel dead inside but now I've lost all my will to try<br />So I'll drink and fuck and hope that the pain subsides<br />The only place I feel safe to hide is beyond repair and compromised<br />Now I'm wondering if I should just let it go...{% endraw %}
