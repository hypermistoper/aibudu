{% raw %}Surgery day has finally arrived for conjoined twins Abigail and Micaela's separation. More than 30 team members crowd the operating room for the marathon procedure to separate the girls, who are attached at the head. The twins’ shared anatomy complicates the anesthesia. Surgeons make a surprise discovery and must make a tough call.
