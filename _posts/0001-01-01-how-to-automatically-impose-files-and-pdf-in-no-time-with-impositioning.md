{% raw %}The main challenge with imposing pages is that for one time jobs you need to be fast and flexible. For recurring jobs you need high or even complete automation. OneVision's solution for flexible imposition is most easy to use.  It guides users step by step and let's them specify every aspect of an imposition template. This is helpful in all cases where you need to improvise and act fast to meet your print deadlines. A completely different story are those recurring jobs with which it should be easy to make money. But all too often you make a loss instead of profit. Why is this so? The most typical reason is that errors or delays occur somewhere in your process. They can only occur if your processes include manual tasks. The solution is: automate your imposition. You reach multiple goals, faster time to print, less errors. Your staff has more time for dealing with complicated, challenging and promising one-time jobs instead of wasting time with processes that can and should be automated. Auto-imposition comes with a template editor. This means you setup the imposition schemes exactly as you need them in your company. It also comes with a complete workflow. All you need to do is set up the system once. From then on you will copy jobs into one folder and while you navigate to the output folder the jobs will already be there, waiting for you.  Some examples: a) you can work with only one imposition template for any incoming page format or b) you can use different templates, based on the files' names. How do you deal with jobs requiring extra treatment for front and back cover? First separate the cover pages from content pages manually? Then impose the pages? Well, this can be completely automated  due to auto-impose and its built-in workflow system. The automated version is integrated in the worfklow management suite Workspace, while the flexible, interactive imposition is a standalone app. <br /><br /><br />For more information check:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.onevision.com/solutions/prepress-software/impose/">https://www.onevision.com/solutions/prepress-software/impose/</a><br />Contact us: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.onevision.com/contact">https://www.onevision.com/contact</a>{% endraw %}
