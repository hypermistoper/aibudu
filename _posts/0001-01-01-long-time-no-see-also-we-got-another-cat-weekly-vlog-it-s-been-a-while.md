{% raw %}it's been a while, huh? hello!!! so good to see you again!!<br />I know I've been away for AGES but I needed it to like. get my creative brain right, and also start adderall and therapy for my ADHD lol~ <br /><br />I hope you like this cozy little video -- not too much art stuff, mostly just focusing on our NEW CATTOOOO (say hello to nova/pepper! also known as nova pepper! :3) we're taking the introduction process between her and soph super super slow -- and we're v optimistic, but since they're both old ladies I wanna make sure to not rush and scare them :( they did meet face to face yesterday, with only a bit of hissing before we separated them again, but sophie was batting under the bedroom door this morning with her tail all fluffed up, so..we are gonna keep taking it REAL slow lol. I got two of those feliway diffusers, that I'm hoping might calm them down a bit~<br /><br />I hope you're alright!! talk soon (maybe) xx<br /><br />✧˖° jessie stash basket tutorial: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/NOokP0rNR3M">https://youtu.be/NOokP0rNR3M</a> from @TL Yarn Crafts !<br />✧˖° meredith's youtube channel! @Meredith Aleigha Wells :o)<br /><br />✧˖° socials<br />• <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/cheyennebarton">https://www.patreon.com/cheyennebarton</a><br />• insta: @chey.barton<br />• twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/cheyennebarton​​">https://twitch.tv/cheyennebarton​​</a><br />• shop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cheyennebarton.com​​">https://cheyennebarton.com​​</a><br />• twitter/pinterest/spotify: @cheyennebarton<br /><br />✧˖° tools<br />• camera: sony a6400 w/ a 28mm lens, 35mm lens, kit lens, 20 mm lens<br />• editing: premiere pro cc<br /><br />☆ all my music from Lullatone is used under a license agreement with the artists.<br />☆ all other songs are from Epidemic Sound! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://epidemicsound.com/referral/0a8u5i">https://epidemicsound.com/referral/0a8u5i</a>{% endraw %}
