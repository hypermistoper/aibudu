{% raw %}Here's to us one more toast and then we'll pay the bill<br />Deep inside both of us can feel the autumn chill<br />Birds of passage, you and me<br />We fly instinctively<br />When the summer's over and the dark clouds hide the sun<br />Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done<br /><br />It's been there in my dreams the scene i see unfold<br />Who at last flesh and blood to cherish and hold<br />Jealous fools will suffer yes i know and i confess<br />once i lost my way when something good had just began<br />lesson learned its history all is said and done<br /><br /><br />In our lives we have walked some strange and lonely treks<br />Slightly worn but dignified and not too old for sex<br />We're still striving for the sky<br />No taste for humble pie<br />Thanks for all your generous love and thanks for all the fun<br />Neither you nor I'm to blame when all is said and done<br /><br /><br />It's so strange when you're down and lying on the floor<br />How you rise, shake your head, get up and ask for more<br />Clear-headed and open-eyed<br />With nothing left to try<br />Standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run<br />There's no hurry any more when all is said and done<br /><br /><br />Standing calmly at the crossroads,no desire to run<br />There's no hurry any more when all is said and done{% endraw %}
