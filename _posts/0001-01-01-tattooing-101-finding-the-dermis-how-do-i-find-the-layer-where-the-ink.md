{% raw %}How do I find the layer where the ink goes? <br /><br />In this video I break down and touch base on where we would want to put the ink into upon tattooing. <br /><br />I remember when I first began my tattooing journey I was so afraid to blow out the skin I would barely scratch the surface of the skin. At first I thought that this approach where I would start light and build up the tattoo to avoid blow outs was a better approach. After my first tattoo I quickly saw that &quot;scratching&quot; was not going to work out well, especially if I wanted to tattoo for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />I learned that the skin was not how I thought it was. There is layers to the skin in which a tattooist should be aware of. <br /><br />We have the 1st layer which is the Epidermis. (Where the ink falls out)<br />We have the 2nd layer which is the Dermis. (Where the ink lives)<br />We have the 3rd layer which is the Hypodermis. (Where blowouts happen)<br /><br />These layers are a bit more resilient over what I naturally thought. The skin has too essentially be broken to get the ink into the skin effectively. We have to know exactly what to look and feel for upon tattooing and thats what I elaborate more on in this video for you. <br /><br />I don't want to over complicate the process here in the description as I break that down within the video and I even share some exercises you can practice right now to level up your skillsets. <br /><br />In this video I am using a silicone fake skin. If you are interested in these specific practice skins I will go ahead and link you to the product page here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3as9L4r">https://amzn.to/3as9L4r</a><br /><br />For this demonstration video I am using my Q2 tattoo machine along with Quelle Needle Cartridges. I will go ahead and drop the links to these tools below for you. <br /><br />The CNC-Q2 is super easy to maintain, clean and setup. I show you in this video how to disassemble and put back together which is the exact same process we would take to clean and sterilize the machine for our next session. <br /><br />This is only half of why I love the CNC-Q2! Aside from the ease of use and sterilization process, the CNC-Q2 is a little workhorse because it is great for lining, shading, black and grey, and color packing. It can do it all effortlessly. <br /><br />I would recommend to pick up a pair of Q2's. <br /><br />The CNC-Q2 Tattoo Machine Is A Must Have For Any Caliber Tattooist!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cnctattoo.com/shop/cnc-tattoo-machines-short-tattoo-pen-new-program-faulhaber-q2/?ref=10&amp;campaign=CNCTattooMachinesPenNewProgramFaulhaberQ2">https://www.cnctattoo.com/shop/cnc-tattoo-machines-short-tattoo-pen-new-program-faulhaber-q2/?ref=10&amp;campaign=CNCTattooMachinesPenNewProgramFaulhaberQ2</a><br /><br />For machines, needles and more check out CNC at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cnctattoo.com/?ref=10&amp;campaign=CNC.com">https://www.cnctattoo.com/?ref=10&amp;campaign=CNC.com</a><br /><br />If you are looking to grow your Youtube channel check out this awesome resource I use <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tubebuddy.com/DanielYuck">https://www.tubebuddy.com/DanielYuck</a><br /><br />If you have any questions at all please feel free to drop a comment down below and I will do my best to guide you in the best possible direction.<br /><br />Don't forget to to ring that bell &amp;
