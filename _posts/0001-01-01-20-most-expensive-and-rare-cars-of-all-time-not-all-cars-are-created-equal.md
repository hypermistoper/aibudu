{% raw %}Not all cars are created equal.  I think we can all agree on that,  But it turns out that some cars in particular are so very rare and so very expensive that they have busted all the records for crazy auction prices and extreme scarcity.  Add to that the wealthy elite’s penchant for all things fast and shiny and there is a guaranteed way to extract silly amounts of money for an assemblage of metal and fibreglass.  <br /><br />From a movie-inspired mega-car with the turning circle of the Titanic, to a Hollywood legend’s runaround, here are 20 Most Expensive and Rare Cars of All Time.<br /><br />► For copyright matters please contact us: newfifth1@gmail.com{% endraw %}
