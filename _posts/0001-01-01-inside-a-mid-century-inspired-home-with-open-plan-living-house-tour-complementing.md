{% raw %}Complementing the Australian climate, Brighton East 4 is a mid-century inspired home crafted to meet the demands of a young family. Designed and built by Inform, the house takes inspiration from Palm Springs.   <br /><br />Settled into the same-named Melbourne suburb, Brighton East 4 articulates quintessential Australian living. As a mid-century inspired home, the residence has an informal, open-plan layout and natural materiality, including the use of stone and timber. <br /><br />Architecturally, Brighton East 4 curves, further evidencing its existence as a mid-century inspired home. Present in both the external and internal architecture, curves effortlessly unify the outdoor and indoor aspects of the home, creating fluidity and softness.<br /><br />Natural materials are a key feature of a mid-century inspired home and are incorporated throughout the project. Behind the staircase sits a feature wall of stack-bond brickwork, whilst the bathroom sees terrazzo used generously. In the kitchen, the island bench sports an elegant stone top, with slatted timber battens at its base.<br /><br />Showcasing their proficiency in architecture and interiors, Inform craft a comfortable residence with a strong sense of spatial flow. As a mid-century inspired home, Brighton East 4 testifies to its Palm Springs influence through a natural and restrained materiality. <br /><br />00:00 - Introduction to the Mid-Century Inspired Home<br />00:56 - The Client Brief<br />01:20 - Walking Through the Home<br />02:02 - Interior Design Style<br />02:43 - The Island Bench <br />03:04 - Colour Palette and Materiality <br />03:36 - Collaboration between the Client, Architect and Builder<br />04:06 - The Feel of the Home<br />04:41 - Successfully Meeting the Client Brief<br /><br />For more from The Local Project: <br /><br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/">https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/</a> <br />Website – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/</a> <br />Print Publication – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/</a> <br />The Local Project Marketplace – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/marketplace/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/marketplace/</a> <br /><br />To subscribe to The Local Project's Tri-Annual Print Publication see here – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/</a> <br /><br />Photography by Timothy Kaye. <br />Design and Build by Inform.<br />Styling by Bea + Co.<br />Filmed and Edited by Dan Preston. <br />Production by The Local Project.<br /><br />The Local Project Acknowledges the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the Traditional Owners of the land in Australia.
