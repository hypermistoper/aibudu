{% raw %}In 1850, 94% of the world's population lived in extreme poverty. Today, we've managed to bring that number down to roughly 10%. And if this trend continues, we might even succeed in eradicating poverty by 2030.<br /><br />If that doesn’t tell you that our world is getting richer, then how about this: 2018 saw the emergence of the first billion-dollar man. The idea of that much money is enough to make your head spin. But don’t tell me you’ve never dreamed about it.<br /><br />Transcript and sources: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://insh.world/culture/what-if-you-had-one-billion-dollars/">https://insh.world/culture/what-if-you-had-one-billion-dollars/</a><br /><br />About What If: <br />Presented by INSH<br /><br />What If asks some of the most provocative hypothetical questions in science — and then tries to answer them with the help of established scientific theory and the latest research. <br /><br />Follow what-if on Instagram for bonus material: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/what.if.show/">https://www.instagram.com/what.if.show/</a><br /><br />Produced by <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://insh.world">http://insh.world</a><br />Follow the show on Facebook Watch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/What.If.science">https://www.facebook.com/What.If.science</a>{% endraw %}
