{% raw %}As electric vehicles become more and more prominent on our roads - and charging capacity more and more of an issue - Norway has come up with a clever, broad-view solution for its fleet of taxis, called ‘ElectriCity’. In the future, it might take in far more vehicles, too.<br /><br />The Nordic country has already committed to requiring all  new cars sold from 2025 onwards are electric, and intends to build an entirely emission-free taxi service to assist in its lofty aims.<br /><br />With charging time an efficiency limiting factor for electric commercial vehicles in particular, they’ll be doing this by charging the cabs wirelessly, through the taxi rank they sit on, as the taxis wait to be hired. <br /><br />This saves in several ways: no need to hunt out an available charger, no need to wait separately for a charge and to be hired, and no need to even plug in or unplug when a fare arrives, all of which save precious time in which to earn. In the industry, after all, time is money.<br /><br />SUGGEST A TOPIC<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://techvision.tv​">https://techvision.tv​</a><br /><br />Imagery supplied via Getty Images<br /><br />Norway's Wireless Charging Roads{% endraw %}
