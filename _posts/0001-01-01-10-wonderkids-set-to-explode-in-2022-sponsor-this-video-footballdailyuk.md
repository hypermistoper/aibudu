{% raw %}► SPONSOR THIS VIDEO: footballdailyuk@gmail.com<br /><br />It’s that time of year again where we profile the ten wonderkids you need to keep an eye on in 2022! Excluding those already at the top level, such as Bellingham, Camavinga and Pedri, we go on a world tour, including picking out two Americans in Caden Clark and Ricardo Pepi that could be star names for the US at next year’s World Cup. Wingers Kamaldeen Sulemana of Rennes and Villarreal’s Yeremi Pino make the cut, whilst Leipzig’s Josko Gvardiol is the only defender here. Kacper Kozlowski and Adam Hlozek are impressing in minor leagues, and Dinamo Moscow’s 18-year-old Arsen Zakharyan is already their player of the year. Then of course Karim Adeyemi and Gavi are here too.
