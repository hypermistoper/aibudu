{% raw %}Mt. Ebal is only mentioned in the Old Testament. It is the location that Joshua, the successor of Moses, takes the Tablets and makes a Curse upon the Canaanites. This mountain is adjacent to the Holy City of Shechem, where Jacob, Moses, Abraham, Joseph are all buried. The other side of Shechem is Mt. Gerizim where the Blessings were done in the Covenant with Yahweh (YHVH).<br /><br /><br />More from Archeologist Scott Stripling's Discovery:<br />Derek Lambert Interview:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jamestabor.com/a-full-interview-with-archaeologist-scott-stripling-on-the-lead-curse-tablet-found-at-ebal/">https://jamestabor.com/a-full-interview-with-archaeologist-scott-stripling-on-the-lead-curse-tablet-found-at-ebal/</a><br />Professor James Tabor:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jamestabor.com/oldest-hebrew-inscription-ever-found-in-israel-what-we-know-so-far/">https://jamestabor.com/oldest-hebrew-inscription-ever-found-in-israel-what-we-know-so-far/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant">https://www.patreon.com/GnosticInformant</a><br />Please Consider joining my Patreon to help fund my research and finding scholars to bring on.
