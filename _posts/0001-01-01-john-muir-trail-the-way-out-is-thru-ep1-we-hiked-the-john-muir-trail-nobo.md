{% raw %}We hiked the John Muir Trail (NOBO) in the Summer of 2021. This video covers the first 70 miles of the JMT out of Cottonwood Pass. <br /><br />This video is presented with limited narration and maximum views. While no video can capture the JMT in all its glory, I attempted to do so with our Sony a7iii / Sigma 24-70mm 2.8 and an iPhone 11.<br /><br />Crack open a cold freshie or any beverage of your choosing for Episode 1.{% endraw %}
