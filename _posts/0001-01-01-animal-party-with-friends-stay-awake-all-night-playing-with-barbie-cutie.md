{% raw %}build a pillow fort and grab the snacks cause we're having a SLEEPOVER!<br />This is an #ad for Mattel. <br />LET'S BE FRIENDS -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ">https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ</a><br /><br />HEY EVERYBODY!! Today I am having a SLEEPOVER!! Do you know why they call it a sleepover? Because you skip OVER the SLEEP!! You just stay up all night with your best friends! So today I am inviting my best friends to come to my slumber party, but first I have to set up! You HAVE to have a soft, comfy, cozy pillow fort for a sleepover. So Me and Mom set one up with the nuggets in the basement. OH, and you need snacks so Mom brought a big bowl of popcorn for us to share. They I brought out the surprises... Barbie Cutie Reveals! Me and Mom opened ours before our other guests Armani and Alli showed up. The dolls are SO cute, they have a full cozy animal costume on. AND they each have their own matching pet! Before our other friends showed up I decided to hide their surprises for them to find! Once they found them, they opened their dolls so they we could have a makeover! I had THE BEST TIME at our slumber party! I can't wait to have another one!<br /><br />Bye vlog *pshhhhh*{% endraw %}
