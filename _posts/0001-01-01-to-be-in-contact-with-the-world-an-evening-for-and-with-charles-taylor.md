{% raw %}Thursday, 5 May 2022, 18:30 CET<br />SPITTELAUER LÄNDE 3, IWM Library, VIENNA, 1090<br /><br />Charles Taylor, one of the outstanding philosophers of our age, turned 90 on November 5, 2021. Taylor has been closely associated with the Institute for Human Sciences for more than three decades. His life and work have always been inseparably bound up with one another. He is a scholar, a committed citizen, and a public intellectual. Many researchers owe him an immense debt of gratitude for his intellectual inspiration to their work and, most importantly, for his generous friendliness and charming esprit. Rajeev Bhargava and Hartmut Rosa, two of Taylor’s intellectual companions for a long time, will honor his work and personality.<br /><br />Tributes by Rajeev Bhargava and Hartmut Rosa<br />Moderated by Elisabeth von Thadden<br />In conversation with Charles Taylor<br />Introdcution by IWM Rector Misha Glenny<br />Music by Andrij Prosorow{% endraw %}
