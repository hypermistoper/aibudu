{% raw %}Ukrainian forces destroyed helicopters Ka-52 and Mi-28 Russia at operating over Ukraine<br /><br />Not only are Ukrainian MANPADS (Man Portable Air Defense Systems) a significant threat to the Russian Ka-52 and Mi-28 gunship helicopters operating over Ukraine but also ATGMs. The following clip has started to circulate online on social media on Apr. 5, 2022, and shows a Russian Aerospace Forces (VKS) Alligator gunship shot down by a Ukrainian Stugna-P ATGM.<br /><br />The video says it all: you can see the Ka-52 hovering at very low altitude over some trees, allowing the Ukrainian operator to aim and fire the  tank-booster missile at the helicopter. In a matter of a few seconds, the Russian gunship is hit by the missile.<br /><br />Most of the videos we have seen emerging from Ukraine so far show the Russian Ka-52 carrying unguided rockets and Vikhr ATGMs. We have already explained how unguided rockets are fired at targets: the helicopters fly at low level then pull up into steep climb, and launch the rockets at the top of the parabolic arc of their flightpath, sending them downrange, then they break hard left and escape fast at low altitude<br /><br />Thanks For Watching<br />The Thumbnail/Videos are for illustrasion purpose only<br /><br />#russianews #ukrainenews #russiahelicopters{% endraw %}
