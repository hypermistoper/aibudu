What you haven’t heard is who is really to blame. On today’s program, we show you examples of international media reporting about terrorist attacks. They’re just a little bit biased. <br /><br />Also, the mainstream media will be sure to not emphasize the fact that all of these attacks are happening inside “Israel proper”, not in the “West Bank”. AND, many of these attacks are being committed by Israeli Arab citizens. <br /><br />Watch today’s video for the true and authentic stories from Israel. <br /><br />Shop our Affiliate Links (we earn a small commission from purchases made through the following links): <br />Purchase wine from Israel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.theisraelguys.com/store/category/wine/">https://shop.theisraelguys.com/store/category/wine/</a><br />Shop products from Israel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3FPELdd">https://bit.ly/3FPELdd</a><br /><br />Download “The Israel Guys” social media app, available on iOS, Google Play and at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://theisraelguys.com/app/.">https://theisraelguys.com/app/.</a> <br /><br />Become a monthly supporter at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/theisraelguys">https://www.patreon.com/theisraelguys</a> or <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://theisraelguys.com/donate/.">https://theisraelguys.com/donate/.</a> <br /><br />#theisraelguys #israelnews #terrorattacksinisrael<br /><br />Source links <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jns.org/palestinian-vandals-set-fire-to-josephs-tomb/">https://www.jns.org/palestinian-vandals-set-fire-to-josephs-tomb/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-703568">https://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-703568</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/325524">https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/325524</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-703663">https://www.jpost.com/opinion/article-703663</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://palwatch.org/page/31051">https://palwatch.org/page/31051</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://palwatch.org/page/30902">https://palwatch.org/page/30902</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jns.org/bennett-israel-going-on-the-offensive-in-fight-against-terror">https://www.jns.org/bennett-israel-going-on-the-offensive-in-fight-against-terror</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jns.org/gantz-israel-to-grant-tens-of-thousands-of-additional-work-visas-to-palestinians">https://www.jns.org/gantz-israel-to-grant-tens-of-thousands-of-additional-work-visas-to-palestinians</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/325740">https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/325740</a>{% endraw %}
