{% raw %}Animals can speak. Sometimes they say &quot;help me.&quot; <br />Please donate: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.animalaidunlimited.org/donate">https://www.animalaidunlimited.org/donate</a><br /><br />*Graphic content for educational purposes.<br /><br />A mother's growing calf was terribly injured on the back of his neck with a deep wound filled with maggots. We knew they needed to be together, but the day we rescued him we didn't have room in our ambulance to bring them both. We hurried him for emergency treatment, but he was alone. <br /><br />The next day after removing the maggots and thoroughly cleaning the wound, our ambulance pulled up with a big beautiful surprise for this little angel: his mommy! In a jiffy, they found each other, and then this calf's healing process could gallop along! Daily wound cleaning and fresh dressings enabled that awful wound to close within a couple of weeks. <br /><br />Meet Petal and Rose now!{% endraw %}
