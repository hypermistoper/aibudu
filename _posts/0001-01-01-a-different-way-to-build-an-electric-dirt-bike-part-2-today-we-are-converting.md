{% raw %}Today we are converting a cheap Pit Bike into electric power with a 6000w 72v electric motor I purchased from Electro &amp; Co. Instead of removing the gas engine and replacing it with the electric motor, I wanted to still have the gears the Pit Bike originally had. so I figured out a way to remove the crankshaft and replace it with a sprocket so I could run it with the electric motor. I'm very excited to finish this project and see what this thing can do!!<br /><br /><br /><br />check out go power sports for all your go kart needs <br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2sC3WLT">https://bit.ly/2sC3WLT</a><br /><br />ratherBwelding merchandise <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2PF21Vf">https://bit.ly/2PF21Vf</a><br /><br />Follow me on Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rather_bwelding/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/rather_bwelding/?hl=en</a><br /><br />help support me on Patreon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/ratherBwelding">https://www.patreon.com/ratherBwelding</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Electro &amp; Co 6000w electric motor <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3MLOrsb">https://bit.ly/3MLOrsb</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.epidemicsound.com)">http://www.epidemicsound.com)</a>{% endraw %}
