{% raw %}I've been working on the layout almost every day since that last video.  What started off as re-profiling the curves heading into the station turned into a huge project that took about 180 hours to complete.  With everything now back up and running I'm really looking forward to getting some scenery done in the large area.  <br /><br />Hope you enjoy the new changes, cheers.{% endraw %}
