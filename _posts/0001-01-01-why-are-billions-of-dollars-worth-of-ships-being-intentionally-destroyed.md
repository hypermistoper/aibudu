Every year trillions of dollars worth of cargo is transported on ships like these and losing this fleet could turn into a huge barrier to global trade.<br /><br />But what is really going on here?<br /><br />Why would profit-motivated companies destroy billions of dollars worth of productive assets? Sure times are tough, tourism and trade have declined massively but this hardly looks like a reasonable response right?<br /><br />I don’t burn down my house if a video gets less than 10,000 likes, so why would companies in such a competitive industry do something equally as self-destructive?<br /><br />Well as always it has to do with economics (go figure) and to understand this bizarre behavior we need to understand a few key areas.<br /><br />What are the economics behind the merchant marine fleet?<br /><br />How do these factors make it financially viable to destroy ships?<br /><br />what does this mean for the future of international trade?<br /><br />And what does this all have to do with Chinese bridge building?<br /><br /><br /><br />Enjoyed the video?
