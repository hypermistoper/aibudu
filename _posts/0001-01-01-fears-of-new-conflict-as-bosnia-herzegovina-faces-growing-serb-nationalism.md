{% raw %}The peace agreement that holds together Bosnia-Herzegovina is under threat from a rise in Serb nationalism.<br /><br />More than three years of war in the 1990s devastated Bosnia after the fall of Yugoslavia. Tens of thousands of people were killed and hundreds of thousands were driven from their homes by ethnic cleansing.<br /><br />The war ended in 1995 with a peace treaty that split the country into two parts: a Bosniak Muslim and Croat federation - and the other a Serb entity called Republika Srpska.<br /><br />Now an ongoing political crisis and the resurgence of Serb nationalism under Bosnian Serb leader Milorad Dodic, is stirring up fears of renewed conflict. <br /><br />Huw Edwards presents BBC News at Ten reporting by Jeremy Bowen.<br /><br />Please subscribe HERE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1rbfUog">http://bit.ly/1rbfUog</a><br /><br />#BBCNews{% endraw %}
