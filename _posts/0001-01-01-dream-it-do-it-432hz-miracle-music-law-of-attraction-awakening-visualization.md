{% raw %}Law of Attraction Meditation: It has become a popular belief that people can achieve everything they have ever wanted by pure desire and imagination. Since the debut of The Secret in 2006, people started thinking that the mere manifestation of their dream lives was the only action they required to activate what is called the &quot;Law of Attraction&quot;. However, &quot;Dream it and do it&quot; requires much more than positive thinking. Asserting positive phrases in one's head doesn't work per se. <br /><br />Understanding the various components that are useful to activate the Law of Attraction is essential to make dreams true. Six basic factors have to be taken into account for this purpose: the conscious mind, the unconscious -or subconscious- mind, the basic understanding of the reality each person lives in, recognizing beliefs and interpretations, and being aware of thoughts and actions.<br /><br />Nonetheless, facing the six dimensions at once may be overwhelming for some. Therefore, it is useful to find a lever to help people through the process of understanding and recognition. One of those levers is the Law of Attraction Meditation.<br /><br />Law of Attraction Meditation - A way to change and understand thoughts and beliefs<br /><br />To be able to be conscious of one's thoughts, actions, beliefs, interpretations and the reality in general, it is necessary to start from the roots of everything: the subconscious mind. Law of Attraction Meditation is the perfect way to train one's mind to new possibilities that were not visible before through a process of &quot;thought unclogging&quot;. <br /><br />In other words, meditation aids to calm the mind and concentrate on what is important and generates value, effectively limiting the negative thoughts that are being constantly attracted. Once a person has achieved the power to control and understand its thinking process, manifestations will be easier to make real and tangible.<br /><br />This is 432 Hz music: Tuning our music to less than 440 Hz we can directly access universes all hidden treasures. 432 Hz music is used in therapy to help people with anxiety and depression to ease their mind of stress and bad feelings.

Our inner self always tries to maintain our body's balance and health but our beliefs always interfere. So ‚ÄúIf you believe you can, you can‚Äù. Positive thinking, positive visualization and your hard work is the key to success with the law of attraction. My music helps you deepen your visualization or law of attraction meditation, helping you ground and connect with your inner power source (your subconscious mind).<br /><br />===================================================<br />¬©Ô∏è STRICT COPYRIGHT WARNING:<br />All rights reserved. ¬© Copyright of Supernatural Brainwave Power Ltd.<br /><br />‚òõ Related hashtags:<br />#MeditationMusic #ManifestMeditation #LawOfAttraction{% endraw %}
