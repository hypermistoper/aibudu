Often described as &quot;a show about nothing,&quot; Seinfeld mines the humor in life's mundane situations like waiting in line, searching for a lost item, or the trials and tribulations of dating. Co-starring are Julia Louis-Dreyfus as Jerry's ex-girlfriend and current platonic pal, Elaine Benes; Jason Alexander as George Costanza, Jerry's neurotic hard-luck best friend; and Michael Richards as Jerry's eccentric neighbor, Kramer.<br /><br />#Seinfeld #LarryDavid #ThePostponement<br /><br />George Tries To Postpone His Wedding | The Postponement | Seinfeld<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SeinfeldTV">https://www.youtube.com/c/SeinfeldTV</a>{% endraw %}
