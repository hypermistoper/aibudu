{% raw %}30,000 MW should cover us for what we have planned. We knock out supercomputers, turbo motors, control rods and battery's.<br />The tricky part is going to be balancing all the resources on the belts. Never mind the silly amount of backfilling we have to do. We need to beef up every single production chain and upgrade all the belts to Mk5. I'm really looking forward to seeing what the base looks like when it's all done.<br /><br />Credits Song : Easy Shake - Geographer<br /><br />Save game file<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jf2Wni6xLW-eYRLKTcn91q0cUwQ7e1Wj/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jf2Wni6xLW-eYRLKTcn91q0cUwQ7e1Wj/view?usp=sharing</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/FrancisJohn">https://www.patreon.com/FrancisJohn</a><br /><br />Discord server : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/4unUzJSB5h">https://discord.gg/4unUzJSB5h</a> <br /><br />Mods :<br />Smart!<br />PermaDay<br />Hotswap Equipment{% endraw %}
