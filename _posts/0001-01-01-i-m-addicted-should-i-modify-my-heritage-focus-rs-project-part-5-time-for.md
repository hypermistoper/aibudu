{% raw %}Time for more mods to the project Ford Focus RS Red Edition! I've very much got the bug for this and may even make some changes to my RS Heritage Edition... For now it's to Dub Customs for the installation of a carbon engine bay from Kuro Carbon, illuminated door sills from Car Enhancements UK, and fitting a shark fin antenna from Paintmodz. What should be done next?!<br /><br />Don't forget to check out the new additions to the Shmee150 shop at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shop.shmee150.com">http://shop.shmee150.com</a><br /><br />The first part is to install the Kuro Carbon engine bay comprising of 4 parts; the main engine cover, coolant cover, battery cover and fuse box cover to significantly enhance the appearance.<br /><br />Then we have a few small parts from Paintmodz including the shark fin style antennas for both cars, and some replacement washer jet nozzles in dipped carbon to match the bonnet for the Red Edition.<br /><br />Dub Customs themselves then help out with a few visual details including a roof wrap on the Heritage RS; a non-permanent change that matches with the grey of the spoiler to enhance the look slightly. On the Red it's time to also change the gold RS decals on the wing, front and rear, to new silver ones that will match the BBS CI-R wheels that were recently fitted to the car.<br /><br />For the door sills, I have some illuminated sills from Car Enhancements UK for the driver and passenger door areas. Those simply get put in place, wire in and give a very nice effect.<br /><br />Finally, we have a competition! I have a set of Michelin Pilot Sport 4S limited edition tyres with velvet sidewall, these are full spec for a mk3 Ford Focus RS. They will go to the first person who physically visits Dub Customs at 6 Bentalls, Basildon SS14 3BN, UK and arrives on scene to shout &quot;DUB, GIVE ME THE MICHELINS!&quot; - Good luck!<br /><br />Lastly, I learned a lesson buying cheap carbon fibre mirror caps on eBay and sadly to say - they don't fit and won't be going on the car! Stick to the good stuff like Ventus Veloce and Kuro Carbon, or unfortunately it's just a waste of time and money.<br /><br />Kuro Carbon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/kurocarbon/">https://www.instagram.com/kurocarbon/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/kurocarbons/">https://www.facebook.com/kurocarbons/</a><br /><br />Paintmodz:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/paintmodz/">https://www.instagram.com/paintmodz/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/paintmodz">https://www.facebook.com/paintmodz</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paintmodz.co.uk/">https://paintmodz.co.uk/</a><br /><br />Car Enhancements UK:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.carenhancementsuk.co.uk/">https://www.carenhancementsuk.co.uk/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/carenhancements/">https://www.instagram.com/carenhancements/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CarEnhanceUk/">https://www.facebook.com/CarEnhanceUk/</a><br /><br />Dub Customs:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dub_customs/">https://www.instagram.com/dub_customs/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/dubcustoms/">https://www.facebook.com/dubcustoms/</a><br /><br />Michelin UK:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/michelin/">https://www.instagram.com/michelin/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MichelinUK/">https://www.facebook.com/MichelinUK/</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching, Tim<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Shmee150YT">http://bit.ly/Shmee150YT</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.shmee150.com">http://www.shmee150.com</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.fb.com/shmee150">http://www.fb.com/shmee150</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/shmee150">http://www.instagram.com/shmee150</a>{% endraw %}
