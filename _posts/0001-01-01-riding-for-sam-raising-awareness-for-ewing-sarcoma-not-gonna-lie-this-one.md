{% raw %}Not gonna lie, this one was absolutely gut-wrenching for me. For such a vibrant and positive person to lose his life at such a young age just doesn't seem fair. Take me next time, I've had a good run. Making this edit broke me, but it is nothing compared to the pain that Sam's family, friends, and the cycling community have had to deal with on a daily basis. <br /><br />Sam handled this adversity like the champion that he was, and remained positive till the end.  It was an honor to ride with his younger brother Jay Schneider and his MTB coach Clancy Ryburn on one of Sam's favorite trails at Three Sisters in Evergreen, Colorado. Hopefully we have done justice to his legacy. Ride in peace Sam. The impression you left on everyone was immeasurable.   #strengthforsam<br /><br />Sam was working for Yeti as his cancer was discovered and I am proud to represent a company that truly cares about their family. Sam was one of us. If you are reading this, he was one of you. Sam left an impression on everyone he met, on and off the bike. I've never been more proud to be a part of the Colorado cycling community. <br /><br />Sam's only wish before  passing was to increase funding and awareness for Ewing sarcoma research. He put that before himself. Sam's family started the Sam Schneider Legacy Fund to do just that. <br /><br />If you are so inclined, I have listed several ways that you can help below. <br /><br />Donate to the Sam Schneider Legacy Fund here- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://curesearch.org/the-sam-schneider-legacy">https://curesearch.org/the-sam-schneider-legacy</a><br /><br />You can buy one of the yellow Sam jerseys here.
