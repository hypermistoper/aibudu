{% raw %}Tari Eason's defensive versatility and activity along with a will to get to the bucket are a big part of what's made him a potential lottery pick. Eason fits in the mold of modern wings/forwards at 6'8&quot; with a 7'2&quot; wingspan and he put up steal and block rates matched by few other college basketball players ever. <br /><br />Stat Correction: Averaged 1.1 Blocks a game instead of 1.0.<br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/HoopIntelllect">https://twitter.com/HoopIntelllect</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hoopintellect">https://www.instagram.com/hoopintellect</a><br /><br /><br />#NBA #NBADraft #TariEason{% endraw %}
