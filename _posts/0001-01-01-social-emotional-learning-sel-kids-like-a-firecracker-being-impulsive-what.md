{% raw %}What do you do when you feel like a firecracker inside? Have you been having a hard time with impulsivity? Find out how to be mindful in navigating being impulsive<br /><br />Hello Families,<br /><br />As we are all continuing adjusting to our “At-Home Learning”, we wanted to continue to exercise our SEL model, and give our elementary students a way to continue to develop their SEL muscle around our CWC graduate dispositions.<br /><br />We developed some animated shorts to continue to inspire our students to practice their Social and Emotional Learning at home. <br /><br />Our videos are called: SEL KIDS with Ms. O, in which our assistant principal has created animated shorts around SEL practice through story time. Students can watch the video and do the reflection after each short. We will try to get two out a week for students to access via home. We will post them on YouTube for students to be able to access them on various technology mediums. <br /><br />Please share and enjoy!<br />www.selkids.com{% endraw %}
