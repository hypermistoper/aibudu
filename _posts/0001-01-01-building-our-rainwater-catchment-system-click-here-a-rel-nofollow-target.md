In addition to those goals we have a few more ideas of how to upgrade the coop to make it function better on our farm. <br /><br />Shop Our Apparel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bunkerbranding.com/pages/wild-wonderful-off-grid">https://www.bunkerbranding.com/pages/wild-wonderful-off-grid</a><br /><br />We are a couple who are building our own home from the ground up in the mountains of West Virginia.  After living near the city our entire lives we finally decided to sell it all, pack up our 3 kids and live in an RV on our 73 acres while building our own debt free, off-grid house and learning to live a more self-reliant life.<br />Our house build is documented entirely on our main channel &quot;Wild Wonderful Off-Grid&quot; and our family life vlogs can be found on our secondary channel &quot;Wild Wonderful After Show&quot;{% endraw %}
