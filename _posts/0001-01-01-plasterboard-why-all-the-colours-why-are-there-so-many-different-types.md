These plasterboards are the only suitable plasterboards for kitchens and bathrooms as the humid environment will otherwise decay the quality of the board over time and can result in loss of effectiveness of any insulating properties. Using non-moisture-resistant plasterboard in a moist area will lead to damp, rot and mould over time.<br /><br />Acoustic plasterboard<br /><br />Opt for acoustic plasterboard and you’ll get additional benefits over just being able to finish off the room. Acoustic plasterboard will keep the sound out of the room and reduce how noise travels between rooms to give a more private and comfortable life for those living there. Utilising acoustic plasterboard in a living room refurbishment, for example, will mean that a loud movie won’t disrupt a quiet chat in the kitchen.<br /><br />Damp Proof Foil Backed plasterboard<br /><br />Damp-proof plasterboard is equipped with a layer of foil attached to one side. It can be used in environments that are associated with an appreciable level of moisture (such as kitchens).<br /><br />Fire-resistant plasterboard<br /><br />Fire-resistant plasterboard does exactly what it says on the tin. It’s important to become familiar with and choose the right fire performance rating as each rating denotes a different thing. Some fire-resistant plasterboard may be non-combustible, whereas some may offer 240 minutes of fire resistance before it will catch fire. If fire-resistant plasterboard isn’t specified and is just an optional extra, it’s worth choosing what suits your application best. If it’s specified then pick the correct performance rating to meet building regulations.<br /><br />Insulated plasterboard<br /><br />Insulated plasterboard is a favourite amongst dry liners as it’s so easy to install. It’s essentially a piece of insulation board faced with plasterboard but the fact that they’re already bonded together and ready to go makes the process faster and more efficient than if you were installing a layer of insulation and then plasterboard. Just like regular plasterboard, this type can be finished without plastering over too.<br /><br />Info credit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.insulationsuperstore.co.uk">https://www.insulationsuperstore.co.uk</a><br /><br />==========================================<br />#Plasterboard #Drywall #Drylining<br /><br />🔗 Skill Builder Link Tree: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/skillbuilder">https://linktr.ee/skillbuilder</a><br /><br />👍 Tell us what you like: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://skill-builder.uk/vote">http://skill-builder.uk/vote</a><br /><br />📪 Ask Skill Builder: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://skill-builder.uk/send">http://skill-builder.uk/send</a><br /><br />📣 Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/skillbuilderchannel">https://www.facebook.com/skillbuilderchannel</a><br /><br />📷 Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/skill_builder">https://www.instagram.com/skill_builder</a><br /><br />🛒 As an Amazon Associate, we earn from qualifying purchases<br /><br />🎬 All videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/skillbuilderchannel/videos">https://www.youtube.com/skillbuilderchannel/videos</a><br /><br />💧 We Support Charity Water: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.charitywater.org">https://www.charitywater.org</a><br /><br />◾ Out of respect to our channel sponsors and the wide variety of people who watch our videos, we'll remove comments that do not follow common standards of politeness and decency.{% endraw %}
