{% raw %}HealthCam combines visible and thermal video images into a system that can measure heart rate, respiration rate and body temperature due to subtle changes in face color and body shape. A more advanced version will be able to detect blood oxygenation, slip and fall, choking and aspiration. It enables unobtrusive health monitoring in group settings, such as retirement homes, schools and offices, to provide an early warning of potential illness or physical distress.{% endraw %}
