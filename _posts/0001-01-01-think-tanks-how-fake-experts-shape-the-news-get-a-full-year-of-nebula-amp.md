But are they really? Well... no.<br /><br />Funded by large corporations (including the climate denialists at big oil and tobacco companies) and super-rich libertarians such as Charles Koch and Betsy DeVos, these organisations are little more than propaganda fronts which exist solely to produce “research” which furthers the agendas of their funders.<br /><br />Often referred to as “think tanks”, these organisations have had a number of key successes in influencing our collective political discourse over recent years: debates surrounding “Critical Race Theory”, immigration policy and the UK’s process of leaving the European Union have all been significantly influenced by these groups.<br /><br />But, where did these organisations come from? How did they gain such a stranglehold on our politics? And how can we be more astute in spotting their tactics?<br /><br />Support the channel on Patreon at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/tomnicholas">http://patreon.com/tomnicholas</a><br /><br />If you've enjoyed this video and would like to see more including my What The Theory? series in which I provide some snappy introductions to key theories in the humanities as well as video essays and more then do consider subscribing.<br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/tom_nicholas">http://twitter.com/tom_nicholas</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/tomnicholaswtf">http://instagram.com/tomnicholaswtf</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/tomnicholas">http://patreon.com/tomnicholas</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.tomnicholas.com">http://www.tomnicholas.com</a><br /><br />#thinktanks #mediabias #tomnicholas{% endraw %}
