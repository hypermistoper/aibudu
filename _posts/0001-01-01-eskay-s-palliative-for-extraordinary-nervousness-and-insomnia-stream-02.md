{% raw %}Eskay's Palliative for Extraordinary Nervousness and Insomnia Stream is a series of solo streams I started doing as a result of the general anxiety and depression I experienced due to being furloughed from my job during the COVID-19 pandemic. Both being out of work and unable to leave my home left me in a state of constant, exhausted malaise, so I wanted to give myself something to do on a regular schedule to keep me from drifting too far into my own sadness.<br /><br />These streams are meant to be a chill place where folks can come and relax from the worries of the world at large. The games I play here are much different than the material featured on Two Queers Play, often shorter or less complicated games than the narratively- and emotionally-heavy games I play with Vivian.<br /><br />Streams start at noon EST on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday, run for about four hours, and will be ongoing for the foreseeable future.<br /><br />If you want to show your support, you can contribute to the Consequences Of COVID-19 Kitty:<br />Patreon -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/8PR">https://www.patreon.com/8PR</a><br />Ko-Fi -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/twoqueersplay">https://ko-fi.com/twoqueersplay</a><br /><br />Playlist of all streams: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbw1lM7LEyCY_rpx7P_iLh2W8Q9LCwhKL">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbw1lM7LEyCY_rpx7P_iLh2W8Q9LCwhKL</a>{% endraw %}
