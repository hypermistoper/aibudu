{% raw %}&quot;Bombing Voronezh&quot;: Putin ordered to sell gas to &quot;unfriendly countries&quot; only for rubles Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered to sell gas to &quot;unfriendly countries&quot; for rubles.<br /><br />The Russian leader has apparently decided to bring closer the moment of complete rejection of Russian energy resources by the West. He announced a decision to sell Russian gas to the so-called &quot;unfriendly countries&quot; only for rubles. Putin made the announcement at an online meeting with the Cabinet of Ministers on March 23.<br /><br />During the meeting, Putin once again lashed out at the West for blocking Russia's foreign currency reserves. He began to assert that the EU and the U.S. had thus allegedly undermined confidence in the dollar and the euro. <br /><br />The Russian leader also announced retaliatory sanctions. He said that from now on the so-called &quot;unfriendly countries&quot; will be able to buy gas from Russia only for rubles. &quot;I have decided to implement in a very short time a set of measures to transfer payment for our natural gas supplied to the so-called 'unfriendly countries' for Russian rubles,&quot; the Russian leader said.{% endraw %}
