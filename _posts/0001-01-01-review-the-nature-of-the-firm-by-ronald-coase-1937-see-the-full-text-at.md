This paper of Coase (1937) provided a breakthrough on the significance of transaction costs and property rights for the institutional structure and functioning of the economy. It had an outsized impact on the field of microeconomics, particularly in essentially inventing the body of research that deals with the theory of the firm. For this paper, in 1991, Coase was awarded the Sveriges Riksbank (Bank of Sweden) Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel. And taken into March, 2019, this paper has been cited more than 40,000 times according to Google Scholar. It continues to inspire new areas of inquiry. For example, on its 80th anniversary, an homage was paid to it by extending its logic to the field of blockchains.{% endraw %}
