{% raw %}FIRST JOHN IS ONE OF THE MOST MISUNDERSTOOD EPISTLES IN THE BIBLE AND ALSO THE MOST TWISTED.  What does &quot;abide in Him&quot; mean? Let us look at the contex  and let this letter help our JOY BE FULL instead of giving us a spirit of fear that hath torment and is clearly NOT of God.  I pray this edifies you, saints. <br />If you wish to support or bless this ministry here is our link :  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/ReneeRolandUnTwisted?country.x=US&amp;locale.x=en_US">https://paypal.me/ReneeRolandUnTwisted?country.x=US&amp;locale.x=en_US</a><br />or CashApp at $UntwistedSister<br />Thank you and God bless you all.{% endraw %}
