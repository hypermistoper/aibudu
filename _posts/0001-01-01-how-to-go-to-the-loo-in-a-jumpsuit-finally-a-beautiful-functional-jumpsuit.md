{% raw %}Finally! A beautiful, functional jumpsuit that you don't have to completely remove when you go to the bathroom.<br /><br />Leim's sustainable ezpÂ® jumpsuits are the solution to a problem you kind of knew you had but didn't know how to solve - having to take the whole thing off, getting basically naked every time you want to go to the toilet.<br /><br />Just undo the zips either side of the jumpsuit when it's time to do your business. The back will fall down (but won't touch the floor) leaving your bum free. When you're finished, do the zips up. There's also handy buttons so you don't have to hold the top of the zips together when you do them back up.{% endraw %}
