{% raw %}This morning we had tornadoes hit Southwest Florida.  Much damage was done to several homes in our area.  Thank you so very much to those who reached out checking in and asking if we were ok.  We did not sustain any damage, but sadly many were affected by these storms.  This video is a beach update, including footage taken and shared publicly on Facebook by Michael Tambunga (permission was requested to share this footage.) <br /><br />A donation was made to our local Red Cross of Southwest Florida to help families locally who were affected by the tornadoes.  We send thoughts to them as they begin to rebuild their lives. <br /><br />Thank you for your support, enjoy this beach update, and please everyone stay safe, including our northern VSN members and viewers who are in the midst of a snow storm. We are thinking of you!{% endraw %}
