{% raw %}I'm Rachel Talbott. Welcome to my channel. Thank you for stopping by. =)  I would love to connect in the comments below. Tell me your name and where you're from. I've been scheduling time blocks during my week to spring clean different zones in and outside of my home. Today, while my kids were at school, I cleaned the living room, dining room, and kitchen spaces, and accomplished some spring cleaning habits &amp; goals that I have set for those spaces. So I don't get overwhelmed, I typically do not clean the entire house in one day, although sometimes I do. I find it's easier to accomplish my goals when I set aside blocks of time for different zones and spaces in my home. xo <br /><br /><br />In This Video- <br />Shark Steam Clean Mop <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3L5bDkv">https://amzn.to/3L5bDkv</a><br />Heavy Duty Gloves <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3K1hAh2">https://amzn.to/3K1hAh2</a><br />Cordless Vacuum <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3K8EBP3">https://amzn.to/3K8EBP3</a><br />Dewault Cordless Vacuum <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ExYEWe">https://amzn.to/3ExYEWe</a><br /><br />CONNECT:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://followgram.me/racheltalbott">http://followgram.me/racheltalbott</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/racheltalbott/">https://www.pinterest.com/racheltalbott/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/rachel.talbott">https://www.facebook.com/rachel.talbott</a><br />*<br />SUPPORT MY CHANNEL: <br />Shop my amazon store, with no additional cost to you (beauty &amp; self-care, home maintenance etc) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/racheltalbott">https://www.amazon.com/shop/racheltalbott</a><br />*<br />CAMERA &amp; EQUIPMENT:<br />Canon EOS 5D Mark IV <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3tFMNRT">https://amzn.to/3tFMNRT</a><br />Canon 24-105mm Lens (Medium range zoom lens.
