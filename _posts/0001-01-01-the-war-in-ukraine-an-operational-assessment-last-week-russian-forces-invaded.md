{% raw %}Last week, Russian forces invaded Ukraine and triggered the largest military conflict Europe has seen in eighty years. How did it happen, and what is likely to come next? The Modern War Institute at West Point hosted a multidisciplinary panel to provide an operational assessment of the current state and future projections of the war in Ukraine. The virtual panel features Dr. Rob Person from West Point's Department of Social Sciences, retired Colonel Liam Collins, PhD, who helped reform Ukraineâ€™s defense establishment from 2016 to 2018, and Mr. Michael Kofman of the Center for Naval Analyses.{% endraw %}
