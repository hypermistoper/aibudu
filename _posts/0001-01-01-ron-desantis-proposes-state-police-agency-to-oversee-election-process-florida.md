{% raw %}Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is now proposing a first-of-its-kind police agency that would oversee elections and arrest voters who they say violate election laws. <br /><br />That proposal comes on the heels of another unprecedented move by DeSantis to be the first governor in recent political history to insert himself into the redistricting process, something normally left to state legislatures. <br /><br />Voting rights groups warn DeSantis’ redistricting map is potentially illegal even though he does have the last word and would be the one who signs off even when done through the state legislature. <br /><br />Joe Scott, Broward County supervisor of elections, joins Charles Blow on “Prime” to discuss. <br /><br />All this and more on “Prime.” <br /><br />To watch BNC programming, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bnc.tv/how-to-watch/">https://bnc.tv/how-to-watch/</a> <br />Follow BNC on social media: <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BNCNews">https://www.facebook.com/BNCNews</a>  <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BNCNews">https://twitter.com/BNCNews</a>  <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bncnews/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/bncnews/?hl=en</a> <br /> <br />#RonDeSantis #Elections #CharlesBlow{% endraw %}
