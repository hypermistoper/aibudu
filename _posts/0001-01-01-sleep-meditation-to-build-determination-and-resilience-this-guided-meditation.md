{% raw %}This guided meditation to build determination and resilience is intended to help you find that inner strength, to generate that determination to get going and to fortify the resilience that will see you to the finish line.  In this guided meditation you start right at home, where you are.   You decide to set yourself a challenge.  To go on a day hike.  To reach the peak of a nearby mountain that has wonderful views, so you have heard.  You ask friends / family but everyone has an excuse not to go. But YOU go.<br />As you set off, head out of your home, out of town, all those apathetic excuses fade away and you tune in more to what YOU want. <br /><br />Once you arrive at the base of the hike you are faced with choices: take the easy route or the more challenging route that gives a spectacular view from the top.  And along the way you learn: to reject apathy, to get going NOW, to NEVER give up, to find your own pace, to concern yourself less with others‚Äô progress and focus on your own.  <br /><br />As you progress, I also guide you through clarifying your own goals, wants and needs as well as guide you in overcoming obstacles using a variety of approaches, building resilience to deal with these blocks.<br /><br />And by the time the journey is over I hope and intend that you find greater clarity on your own wants, your own goals and your own needs.  As always I am here to support you on your journey to unlock your life.
