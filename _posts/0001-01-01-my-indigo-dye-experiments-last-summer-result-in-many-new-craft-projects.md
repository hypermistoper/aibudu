{% raw %}I was well on my way to making yards and yards of beautiful indigo dyed fabric last summer and then I got ill! I ended up in hospital, my kids took over the channel for a little while and I slowly got back to some sort of health. (though not yet completely)<br />The project I had hoped to offer to you all in October last year had to be shelved and now offered in a restricted way. But here it is none the less! <br />I loved re-editing this video for you and seeing the garden in all it's summer splendour! <br />The kits I made are now available in the shop, plus some scrap packs and you'll find them here.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thelasthomelyhouse.co.uk">https://www.thelasthomelyhouse.co.uk</a><br />The DOG, the Stained Glass Effect Panel and the Pojagi Style Panel, are all the things I made with the fabric. You can make whatever you like with yours! <br /><br />The quilt I made over on Patreon is the Courthouse Steps block and I dyed all the fabric for that from the deepest blue to very pale indeed. It was a huge amount of fun! It is available to watch straight away at the $20 tier, as are all of last year's Alongs and will be part of the 'reposting' series for the $10 tier a little later in the year. <br />Check all of that out here <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thelasthomelyhouse">https://www.patreon.com/thelasthomelyhouse</a><br />Also - the March Catchup has just gone live for the $5 tier ... something for everyone over on Patreon! <br /><br />I have created an Indigo Craft Playlist with all the examples of the things I made here<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGuqiE43LELTEVLjxdTUmEbdEBFcl5VZ5">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGuqiE43LELTEVLjxdTUmEbdEBFcl5VZ5</a><br /><br />Not all of these projects are indigo dyed fabric, but the items can be made with the kits on sale in the shop. <br /><br />Thank you for watching. <br />Take care<br />Love<br />Kate<br />xxx{% endraw %}
