{% raw %}I guess it's symptomatic of this slight infatuation<br />Stalking you has sorta become like my occupation<br />Used to be a beauty queen with simple acquisitions<br />Met my local rock star now I'm having visions<br /><br />I fell for you, you like me too<br />Lets get it on check 1, 2<br />I fell for you, you want me too<br />Let's get it on<br /><br />Is it wrong? Is it wrong?<br />Making out with you<br />While you're singing your song<br />Is it wrong? Is it wrong?<br />You're playing your guitar and it's turning me on<br />You got your eye liner, long hair<br />Walking round like you don't care<br />You got me in the back of your car, like a star<br />Is it wrong? Is it wrong?<br />If it's wrong I don't wanna be right<br /><br />I get so systematic in this kinda situation<br />I need it, have to have it to take over domination<br />Used to be so simple, never wanting never wishing<br />Now I'm hooked on fame and I'm a girl on a mission<br /><br />I fell for you, it's all for you<br />Let's get it on check 1, 2<br />I fall for you, it's all for you<br />Let's get it on<br /><br />Is it wrong? Is it wrong?<br />Making out with you<br />While you're singing your song<br />Is it wrong? Is it wrong?<br />You're playing your guitar and it's turning me on<br />You got your eye liner, long hair<br />Walking round like you don't care<br />You got me in the back of your car, like a star<br />Is it wrong? Is it wrong?<br />If it's wrong I don't wanna be right<br /><br />The funny little thing about love<br />Is that you're blind all the time<br />And even when you think you had enough<br />You're wanting more it isn't right<br />But you can't stop<br /><br />You got your eye liner, long hair<br />Walking round like you don't care<br />You got me in the back of your car<br />You got your eye liner, long hair<br />Walking round like you don't care<br />You got me in the back of your car<br />Is it wrong? Is it wrong?<br />If it's wrong I don't wanna be right<br /><br />All the rights go to Lana Del Rey and her team (UMG, Interscope, Polydor){% endraw %}
