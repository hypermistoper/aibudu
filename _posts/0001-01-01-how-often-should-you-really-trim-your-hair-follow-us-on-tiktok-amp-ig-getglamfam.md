(See the following videos for more information regarding hair texture: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=577_2MJAPGE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=577_2MJAPGE</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3M4YOD6UyY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3M4YOD6UyY</a><br />keep in mind I have hundreds of hair care videos and hair tutorials on this channel for your convenience!)<br />Another major factor is proper care of your hair.
