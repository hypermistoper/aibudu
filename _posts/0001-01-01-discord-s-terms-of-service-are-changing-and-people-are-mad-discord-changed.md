{% raw %}Discord changed their terms of service (TOS) and people are not happy.<br /><br />Discord added in a couple of clauses that limit the freedom of speech users have on the platform. Discord also introduced a term that would give them the ability to delete your account if it was inactive for more than 2 years. Finally, Discord restricted access to it's platform in &quot;terrorist supporting&quot; countries. These countries include Iran and Cuba.<br /><br />Want to start some sort of revolution?
