{% raw %}Deep Purple performing Smoke on the Water<br /><br />From the album Machine Head<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />We all came out to Montreux<br />On the Lake Geneva shoreline<br />To make records with a mobile<br />We didn't have much time<br />Frank Zappa and the Mothers<br />Were at the best place around<br />But some stupid with a flare gun<br />Burned the place to the ground<br />Smoke on the water, fire in the sky<br />Smoke on the water<br />They burned down the gambling house<br />It died with an awful sound<br />Funky Claude was running in and out<br />Pulling kids out the ground<br />When it all was over<br />We had to find another place<br />But Swiss time was running out<br />It seemed that we would lose the race<br />Smoke on the water, fire in the sky<br />Smoke on the water<br />We ended up at the Grand hotel<br />It was empty cold and bare<br />But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside<br />Making our music there<br />With a few red lights and a few old beds<br />We make a place to sweat<br />No matter what we get out of this<br />I know we'll never forget<br />Smoke on the water, fire in the sky<br />Smoke on the water<br />--<br /><br />Â© 1972 Deep Purple Records<br /><br /><br /><br />Check out Deep Purple's official channel: @deeppurpleos <br /><br />Subscribe to Retro Rock: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/retrorock?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/retrorock?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />#DeepPurple #SmokeOnTheWater #FireInTheSky{% endraw %}
