{% raw %}Gravity Falls Reaction is today's video!<br /><br />Hey everyone! Join me as I continue watching Gravity Falls today with Episodes 7 and 8!<br /><br />Twins Dipper and Mabel Pines are sent to spend the summer with their great-uncle, Grunkle Stan, in the mysterious town of Gravity Falls, Ore. Grunkle Stan has the kids help him run The Mystery Shack, the tourist trap that he owns. The twins try to adapt to the weird surroundings but sense there is something strange about Gravity Falls and begin to unlock its secrets. When Dipper uncovers a cryptic journal that offers insight into the town's mysteries, he and Mabel use it and their enthusiastic desire to vanquish evil to battle the imminent mysteries that surround them.<br /><br />Full length Reactions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=40242594">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=40242594</a><br />Watch me live on Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/itstotallycody">https://www.twitch.tv/itstotallycody</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/">https://www.instagram.com/</a><br /><br /><br />Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
