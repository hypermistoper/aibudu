{% raw %}The story of Bojan Krkic is one of many failed wonderkids who never lived up to their potential, we‚Äôve heard and seen of examples of players like that many, many times already. But what makes Bojan different is that, he was probably the most hyped European wonderkid, and most promising Barcelona youth product of all time. I mean you saw the intro, I know many of you thought his numbers were better than even Messi‚Äôs at an early age. I know there are a few videos already out about Bojan but I wanted to make a different one and focus it on why he didn't live up to his potential - not entirely just about his career path. Leave a like if you enjoyed and let me know what vid you want next üôè ‚ù§Ô∏è<br /><br />Thanks to TheRetroRoute for the inspiration to make this video! Check him out, his videos are very underrated: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnoQXQjLGJvNHSJ8xrRnWTA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnoQXQjLGJvNHSJ8xrRnWTA</a><br /><br />‚ñ∫ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/raymarfootball/">https://www.instagram.com/raymarfootball/</a> <br />‚ñ∫ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RaymarFootballOfficial">https://www.facebook.com/RaymarFootballOfficial</a><br /><br /> 0:00-1:49 Hard To Believe <br />2:00-6:23 The Most Promising Wonderkid<br />6:24-8:02: Disappointments<br />8:03-12:50 The Importance of Mental Health<br /><br /> #Raymar #RaymarFootball #Historia{% endraw %}
