{% raw %}Oral thrush or candidisis is an infection caused by the yeast Candida albicans. Angular cheilitis are lesions in form of fissures or cuts that appear on the lips and that can be contaminated by Candida albicans. In this 3D video from Clínica Médico Dental Pardiñas (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://j.mp/cPardinas)">http://j.mp/cPardinas)</a> we talk about conditions caused by fungi in the mouth, such as oral candidiasis and mouth sores or angular cheilitis.<br />  <br />Candidiasis is caused by the fungus Candida albicans. It can occur in the elderly population with complete or removable prostheses. If the hygienic conditions are not adequate, fungi can develop on the mucous membranes below the prosthesis, as it is an ideal environment for them, due to the humidity and temperature conditions.<br />  <br />It is also common that, due to the use of systemic antibiotics, there is a superinfection by this fungus due to the alteration of the bacterial flora of the body. The Candida fungus is present in the mouth and digestive tract of many of us, something that is considered normal if it does not grow excessively. Normally, a good immune system and certain bacteria considered &quot;beneficial&quot; regulate the amount of this fungus in our body.<br />  <br />This infection is also common in babies and infants. It is important that the bottles and pacifiers used by the babies are properly disinfected to prevent the proliferation of these fungi. Candidiasis usually manifests itself as white patches on the tongue or inside the cheeks that break off when rubbed and leave the area red. Treatment usually consists of rinsing with an antifungal.<br />  <br />The mouth sores or angular cheilitis are frequently present in the population of older adults who suffer a decrease in the vertical dimension, due to the loss of teeth, which allows the mouth to be excessively closed. These lesions are often superinfected with the Candida albicans fungus.<br /><br />More info about oral thrush here 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/oralthrushCP">http://bit.ly/oralthrushCP</a><br /><br />#thrush #candidiasis #yeast <br /><br />MORE 3D VIDEOS of dentistry on our channel 👉<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://j.mp/dental3D">http://j.mp/dental3D</a> <br /><br />Subscribe to our Youtube channel 👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/suscribeteCP">http://bit.ly/suscribeteCP</a> <br /><br />FOLLOW US ON: <br />👍 Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/clinicapardinas">https://www.instagram.com/clinicapardinas</a> <br />👍Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/clinicapardinas">https://www.facebook.com/clinicapardinas</a> <br />👍Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ClinicaPardinas">https://twitter.com/ClinicaPardinas</a><br />👍Tiktok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@clinicapardinas/">https://www.tiktok.com/@clinicapardinas/</a><br />👍 Linkedin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/clinica-pardinas">https://www.linkedin.com/company/clinica-pardinas</a><br />👍 Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.es/clinicapardinas/">https://www.pinterest.es/clinicapardinas/</a>{% endraw %}
