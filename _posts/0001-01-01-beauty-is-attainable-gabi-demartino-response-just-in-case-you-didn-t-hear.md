{% raw %}Just in case you didn't hear it the few times I mentioned it in the video, I don't hate Gabi at all. I watch her videos and enjoy her and her sister's content! I just feel like there is something that she keeps saying in her videos that is quite problematic and I wanted to finally address it. <br /><br />Gabi's channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLGe0PxyRFWmXVGJKq_gGvw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLGe0PxyRFWmXVGJKq_gGvw</a><br /><br />Niki and Gabi's joint channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/nikiandgabibeauty">https://www.youtube.com/user/nikiandgabibeauty</a><br /><br />IG: tealeafneeka<br />Contact: tealeafneeka@gmail.com{% endraw %}
