{% raw %}We challenged chefs of three different skill levels - amateur Emily, home cook Beth, and professional chef Danielle Alex of Diversity Kitchen - to make us their best lobster roll. Once each level of chef had presented their creation, we asked expert food scientist Rose to explain the choices each chef made along the way - both good and bad. Which lobster roll has you pining for a day at the beach?<br /><br /><br /><br />Follow Danielle on Instagram at @danielleginet &amp; @diversitykitchen<br /><br />Keep up with Emily on her YouTube channel at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/emilyduncan">http://youtube.com/emilyduncan</a> and on Instagram at @emilyslamduncan<br /><br />Rose is on Instagram at @rosemarytrout_foodscience<br /><br />Beth can be found at @bethdimino<br /><br />Still haven’t subscribed to Epicurious on YouTube? ►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/epiyoutubesub">http://bit.ly/epiyoutubesub</a><br /><br /><br /><br />ABOUT EPICURIOUS<br /><br />Browse thousands of recipes and videos from Bon Appétit, Gourmet, and more.
