{% raw %}Hello everyone! It's Mylangs back here!<br />This time I'm back with a video with the topic that many asked me: &quot;How do you maintain all the languages?&quot;<br />The more we use, the easier to maintain the languages! This is what everyone knows, right? but what if we can't use all those languages all time time on daily basis?!<br />My video might not be the definite answer but this is my theory of how polyglots, at least I, maintain the languages.<br /><br />Let's learn languages with me!<br />Love,<br />Mylangs<br /><br />#polyglot<br />#language<br />#languagelove<br />#learnlanguages{% endraw %}
