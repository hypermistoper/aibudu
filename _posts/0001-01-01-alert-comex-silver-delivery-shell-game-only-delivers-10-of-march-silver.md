{% raw %}Shocking revelations out of the COMEX Delivery notification as only 10% of the metal has been delivered! Normally it's 90% delivered on the first day. This may be an error in reporting so I will withhold screaming &quot;The Sky is Falling!&quot; until Monday night but given the current situation in silver and around the world...I'M THINKING WE HAVE THE LONG AWAITED SILVER DEFAULT UPON US! WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE?{% endraw %}
