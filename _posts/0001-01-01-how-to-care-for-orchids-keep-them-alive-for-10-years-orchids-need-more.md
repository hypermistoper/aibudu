{% raw %}Orchids need more than an ice cube once a week. I sit down with plant expert, Darryl Cheng (from @HousePlantJournal) to talk about how to keep orchids alive for up to 10 years. We cover off how to water orchids, where to place orchids in the home and how much light they need, how to trim them after the flowers fall off and so much more. After watching this, you'll be an orchid expert yourself. I went from having one orchid that was basically dead to now having 6 beautiful plants and counting and they're thriving! It's so easy to care for orchids if you know what to do. I hope you enjoy this video and please leave any questions or comments below. <br /><br />FIND MELISSA MAKER: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/melissamaker">https://www.instagram.com/melissamaker</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/cleanmyspace">https://www.instagram.com/cleanmyspace</a><br /><br />FIND DARRYL CHENG: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/houseplantjournal">https://www.instagram.com/houseplantjournal</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/houseplantjournal">https://www.youtube.com/houseplantjournal</a>{% endraw %}
