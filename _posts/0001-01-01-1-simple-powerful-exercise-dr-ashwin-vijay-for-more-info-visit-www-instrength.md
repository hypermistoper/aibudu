Especially, if you walk for 20 or 30 minutes in the morning, it kicks starts your brain's neurological circuits. As a consequence, it stimulates the neurological circuits in the body and you will become an active person. <br />The second good thing is, it strengthens joints in our body. Knee and hip joints contribute in a big way to our mobility. Your knee and hip joints are strengthened through 20 minutes of walking. <br /><br />The third reason which is also backed by proven research is that slow to medium paced walking will increase your lung capacity. It will help you to breathe easily without any difficulties. <br />These are the benefits of walking. Anybody can do it. If you do 20 minutes of walking, it will be a gift to your body.<br /><br />மருத்துவர் அஷ்வின் விஜய், <br />Dr Ashwin Vijay <br /><br />Unleash the best version of yourself! <br />The last few years have been a struggle for so many of us - and we realized that our health is the number 1 priority.<br /><br />Together with a team of experts, I have developed powerful products which help to boost our health.
