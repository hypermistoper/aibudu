{% raw %}Lenny has YEARS of experience behind the trigger, and you only have to see him shoot to realize his expertise! In this new series, Lenny will share his tips and tricks to help YOU shoot fast and accurately… along with sharing some fun drills.<br />You can't do most of these drills in a normal &quot;lane range…&quot; which is why we don't offer a &quot;lane range.&quot; Our  Shoot270° ranges in Nashville and San Diego are designed to train you to be a better shooter, not just to get more people into the range! <br /><br />Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shoot270.com">https://shoot270.com</a> for more information.<br /><br />Download our PDF Diagram and instructions HERE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.glockstore.com/rangeday.html">https://www.glockstore.com/rangeday.html</a><br /><br />See what we're up to and MORE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/glockstore">https://linktr.ee/glockstore</a><br /><br />#GlockStore #Glock #LennyMagill{% endraw %}
