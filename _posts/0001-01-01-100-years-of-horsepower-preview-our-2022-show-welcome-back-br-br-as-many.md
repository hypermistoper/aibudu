{% raw %}Welcome back!<br /><br />As many of you have heard in some of the past videos, we are hosting a show this year! We space this show out every 2 years to avoid conflict with the show in Rantoul and the last show we had was in 2018 due to the Covid cancellation in 2020. Needless to say, we are all very excited to bring the show back! We try to have a wide variety of events at our show from horsedrawn equipment to the latest computer-driven tractors. In 2018 we had somewhere in the neighborhood of 10,000 people at the farm, and this year we hope to triple that. Come to the show and help us break that record!<br /><br />Thanks for watching, and I'll see ya next time!{% endraw %}
