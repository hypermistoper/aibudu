{% raw %}I don’t remember my mom at all. She passed away when I was still a baby. My dad got married when I started primary school. My stepmother had a daughter, Emily, who was the same age as me.<br /><br />I remember the day I met her very clearly. I was so happy because I wasn’t going to be alone at home anymore. From now on, I would have a wonderful sister I could play with. But as I got to know her, I realized that I was all wrong. Emily had a really bad personality trait.{% endraw %}
