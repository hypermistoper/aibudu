In order to get the SM64 World Record, you must fail a couple of times. Who knows, maybe a Speedrun Fail can turn into a New Mario 64 Strategy / Speedrun Skip, like chip clip or framewalk. While a ton of progress has been made in Mario 64 speedrunning, we can't forget about all the speedrunning fails. So, this Mario 64 compilation combines that. Hope you enjoy!{% endraw %}
