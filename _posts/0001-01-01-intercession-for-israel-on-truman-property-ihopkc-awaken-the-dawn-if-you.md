{% raw %}If you've watched our Prophetic History of IHOPKC series or watched Mike Bickle's messages on the prophetic history, you'll remember that Mike was told that after he was an older man, we would have 24/7 prayer with worship on the Truman property with Asia connected on unplugged TVs. When Mike first heard that word nearly 40 years ago, it seemed totally impossible. Well, the beginning of this will take place this Tuesday, May 10, at 7am, when a 24-hour prayer tent for Israel is being launched on the Truman Property in partnership with Awaken the Dawn. <br /><br />It will continue for four days straight in the Israel tent until Saturday, May 14, when we go to The Send at Arrowhead Stadium. We want to livestream this opening hour of prayer to many of our friends in Asia and beyond. Join IHOPKC and Awaken the Dawn to pray for Israel for the first time on the Truman property. <br /><br />We fully expect one day to relocate our entire missions base to the Truman property and thus have 24/7, non-stop prayer with worship, including many in Asia and beyond, with state of art technology, etc. But the intercession and worship on that property this week is a prophetic down payment of 24/7 prayer for Israel in the spirit of the tabernacle of David.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />24/7 Worship and Prayer Livestream:<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/ihopkc/live">http://www.youtube.com/ihopkc/live</a><br /><br />  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> <br />Our website:<br /><br />www.ihopkc.org<br /><br /> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Twitter: www.twitter.com/ihopkc<br />Facebook: www.facebook.com/ihopkc<br />Instagram: www.instagram.com/ihopkc<br /><br /> ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /> #IHOPKC{% endraw %}
