{% raw %}A dream fulfilled by two skiers that both filmed and skied two classic couloirs on the majestic mountain Les Dents du Midi. <br /><br />It started as a childish fantasy a long time ago, but over the years the idea to ski these lines became more realistic. Finding out it was actually possible and questioning if we were capable to take on such a challenge.  Last spring the conditions allowed us to give it a try. <br /><br />Les Dents du Midi: <br />The most iconic mountains massifs in the region. From the Rhône valley, lake of Geneva, Portes du Soleil and even from France you”ll see the 7 peaks stand out as one chunk of beauty. Houses, villages and churches are built with the goal of having a view on this mountain, it’s attractive to say the least. <br /><br />This project is made possible by Region Dents du Midi:<br />www.regiondentsdumidi.ch<br /><br />Cinematography: Paul de Groot and Loïc Isliker<br />Edit: Loïc Isliker<br />Producer: Paul de Groot<br />Sound design: Casper Vlek<br />Animation: Sven Stroomberg<br />Artwork: Vincent Bogers<br /><br />Follow us on Instagram:<br />Loïc Isliker: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/loicisliker/">https://www.instagram.com/loicisliker/</a><br />Paul de Groot: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/pauldegrootfreeskier/">https://www.instagram.com/pauldegrootfreeskier/</a><br /><br />Tracklist: <br />Max LL - Regeneration<br />Ryan Taubert - Memories (Instrumental)<br />Wil Pearce - Aurora<br />Feiertag - Hush (TTeo Remix)<br />Makeup and Vanity Set - Asuntos Primordiales<br />LIGHTS &amp; MOTION - Splinter<br />Ryan Taubert - Runner<br />Spark - Josh Hoover{% endraw %}
