Iâ€™ve done the research, and chosen these must-do activities that will help you plan the perfect trip. Right! Itâ€™s time to share with you 9 of the most fantastic things to do on this beautiful island. <br /><br />The awesome power of nature is everywhere in Cyprus, and my first fantastic thing to do illustrates that perfectly - Avakas Gorge. Be sure to bring some comfortable shoes - thereâ€™s a short but lovely hike on the way to the gorge. <br /><br />Okay, so this is the Avakas Gorge trail that we're going to follow. It's very hot, itâ€™s very dry, weâ€™ve dosed up on sun cream, got tonnes of water in the bag and got about a 2-3km trek to go and find the Gorge. So yeah, letâ€™s get walking!  <br /><br />Like I said, itâ€™s a popular tourist destination, so you can expect to see some tour groups on your walk. The tourist presence doesnâ€™t ruin the appeal. A lot has been done to protect the area. Itâ€™s prohibited to pick any plants here, and animals roam freely. Youâ€™re completely surrounded by natural beauty.<br /><br />The walk to the gorge sort of serves a double purpose. The blue sky, the lush green foliage - it sets you up for the shock of finally turning that corner and seeing the walls of the gorge. <br /><br />The gorge is 3km long, and the walls reach up to 30 metres high. These sheer rock walls are so tall that youâ€™re completely protected from the sun, and the cool breeze blowing through the gorge is so nice after a warm and sticky hike. <br /><br />The river is low and calm under foot - but during the winter month, the river levels rise and the small stream becomes a torrent. This sense of danger isnâ€™t just under foot- itâ€™s also overhead.  <br /><br />So there's a rock here which is wedged between the cliff faces and it looks pretty ominous! Looks like itâ€™s about to drop. <br /><br />Beware that some of the mountain roads to get here can be quite tight and get busier as the day goes on. Something to note if youâ€™re a nervous driver. <br /><br />So hereâ€™s a bonus tip for you - right next to wonderful thing to do number 3 is a fantastic restaurant called Oniro By The Sea. <br /><br />Fantastic food, refreshing cocktails, sea views - Oniro has everything, and I canâ€™t recommend enough that you make it a stop on your trip and itâ€™s just a stoneâ€™s throw away from our next destination. In fact, you can probably see it from your table. <br /><br /><br /><br />Itâ€™s just a 5 minute walk from the restaurant at most - the shipwreck of the Edro III. <br /><br />So that the Shipwreck behind me is quite a sight and itâ€™s been here for just under 10 years now. So apparently back in 2011 it embarked for Rhodes, one of the Greek Islands. <br /><br />But never made it, because it hit a freak storm and ended up being caught up on the rocks here just off the coastline. <br /><br />So apparently people fled there, they made it safe, they took out the fuel as soon as they could, so that the oceans werenâ€™t polluted and now? It makes for a rather nice photo opportunity as you can see down there. <br /><br />I couldnâ€™t help myself - I had to get closer to the ship. The rocks are very rough in places, but Iâ€™m so glad I did - getting just that little bit closer to the shipwreck was so awe-inspiring. <br /><br />The clear water and crashing waves were hypnotising. But if you want even more bang for your buck, just 200 metres from the wreck are sea caves carved into the cliffs. <br /><br />A great opportunity to walk down the lunch, take some gorgeous holiday pictures, and get one last look at the shipwreck before heading to your next destination. <br /><br />Coral Bay Beach is widely regarded as one of the best beaches on the island. Thatâ€™s right, it only took me three Things To Do until I wanted to hit the beach, and itâ€™s the most visited beach on Cyprusâ€™ West Coast. <br /><br />Itâ€™s easy to see why - itâ€™s got fine, white sand, calm, clear water - everything youâ€™d want for a day in the sun. If youâ€™re put off by seeing so many people here, donâ€™t worry. I found an easy solution. <br /><br />So yes, Coral Beach is a fairly obvious beach to come to, youâ€™ve got your parasols your water sports, your deckchairs.{% endraw %}
