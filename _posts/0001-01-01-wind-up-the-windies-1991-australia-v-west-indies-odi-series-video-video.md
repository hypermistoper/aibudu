{% raw %}Video highlights of Australia's 1991 ODI tour of the West Indies hosted by Tony Greig with postcards from Richie Benaud. It would be the West Indies' first ever defeat in a limited overs series on home soil. From the video sleeve:<br /><br />&quot;When Alan Border's Australians walked away with the last World Cup they were considered by some to be 'lucky'.<br />The West Indies undefeated at home in One Day matches and considered by many as Cricket's One Day Champions were out to show the Aussies that their luck had run out.<br />But Captain Alan Border and Manager Bobby Simpson had other ideas as the tea jetted off to the Carribean for the 1991 Calypso tour of the West Indes.<br />Here for your enjoyment are the sensational highlights from all of the five one day matches,<br />You'll meet the players and feel the excitement that greeted them as they took the field in Jamaica, Trinidad, Barbados and Guyana. And along with the play you'll find all the statistics you want to know about bothh individual and team performances.<br />Border's Boys certainly put &quot;the wind up the Windies&quot; in the One Day Series and must go into the remainder of the Tests favourites... or will they find Viv Richards' West Indians an unstoppable hurricane!&quot;{% endraw %}
