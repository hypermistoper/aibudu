{% raw %}Marcel Duchamp: The Art of the Possible explores the life, philosophy, and impact of one of the most influential early 20th century modernists, Marcel Duchamp. The film breaks down Duchamp’s ideas and applies them to both historical events and the modernist explosion that blanketed the early 20th century. The Art of the Possible isn’t simply a biopic; rather, the film shows how Duchamp’s ideas changed the public consciousness, and our understanding of aesthetics, art, and culture. The film highlights the singular impact of Duchamp’s philosophy on art, and, more importantly, examines how Duchamp’s revolutionary ideas from the early 20th century have shaped the 21st century and modern-day culture.  <br /><br />Ultimately, Marcel Duchamp: The Art of The Possible is a guide to exploring the possibilities in every art endeavor and showcasing how Duchamp’s ideas gave generations of artists the intellectual backing to pursue new ideas.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://duchampmovie.com/">https://duchampmovie.com/</a><br />Available on iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/marcel-duchamp-the-art-of-the-possible/id1467115750">https://itunes.apple.com/us/movie/marcel-duchamp-the-art-of-the-possible/id1467115750</a><br />Available on Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Marcel-Duchamp-Possible-Jeff-Koons/dp/B07TN4TKK2">https://www.amazon.com/Marcel-Duchamp-Possible-Jeff-Koons/dp/B07TN4TKK2</a>{% endraw %}
