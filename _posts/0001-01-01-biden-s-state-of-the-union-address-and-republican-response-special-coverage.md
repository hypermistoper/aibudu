{% raw %}President Biden used his first State of the Union address to push a &quot;unity agenda&quot; and said Russia will pay a &quot;high price&quot; for its invasion of Ukraine. The country meets tonight &quot;with an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny,&quot; said Mr. Biden in his speech, which focused on the Ukraine crisis, inflation, gas prices, and more. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds delivered the Republican response, criticizing the Biden administration on crime, inflation, and Russia's place in the world. <br /><br />#news #StateOfTheUnion #biden<br /><br />CBS News Streaming Network is the premier 24/7 anchored streaming news service from CBS News and Stations, available free to everyone with access to the Internet.
