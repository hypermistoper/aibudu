{% raw %}Richard Hammond couldn't resist bringing the Buick Riviera home from the Scottish Highlands after he drove it on The Grand Tour. It has sat in his barn ever since, but he has come plans for the car soon, so he has enlisted the help of the Cogs to get it going for the first time since the Scotland trip. Will it start after a few months out of action?{% endraw %}
