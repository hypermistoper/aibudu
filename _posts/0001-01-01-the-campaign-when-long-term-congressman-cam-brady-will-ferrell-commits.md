{% raw %}When long-term congressman Cam Brady (Will Ferrell) commits a major public gaffe before an upcoming election, a pair of ultra-wealthy CEOs plot to put up a rival candidate and gain influence over their North Carolina district. Their man: na&amp;iuml;ve Marty Huggins (Zach Galifianakis), director of the local Tourism Center. At first, Marty appears to be the unlikeliest possible choice but, with the help of his new benefactors' support, a cutthroat campaign manager and his family's political connections, he soon becomes a contender who gives the charismatic Cam plenty to worry about. As election day closes in, the two are locked in a dead heat, with insults quickly escalating to injury until all they care about is burying each other in this mud-slinging, back-stabbing, home-wrecking comedy from &quot;Meet the Parents&quot; director Jay Roach. Because even when you think campaign ethics have hit rock bottom, there's room to dig a whole lot deeper. MPAA Rating: R for crude sexual content, language and brief nudity. &amp;copy; 2012 Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc.{% endraw %}
