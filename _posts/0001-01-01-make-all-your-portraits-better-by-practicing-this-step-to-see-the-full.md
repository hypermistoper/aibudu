They would practice making these drawings for 4 years! <br /><br />Check out some more info on my Block In Bootcamp on Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/62470248">https://www.patreon.com/posts/62470248</a><br /><br />Follow me on:  <br />YouTube - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/stephenbaumanartwork">https://www.youtube.com/c/stephenbaumanartwork</a><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/stephenbaumanartwork/">https://www.instagram.com/stephenbaumanartwork/</a><br />Patreon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/stephenbaumanartwork">https://www.patreon.com/stephenbaumanartwork</a><br />Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://stephenbaumanartwork.com/">https://stephenbaumanartwork.com/</a><br /><br />#artlessons #paintingtips #howtodraw<br /><br />About me: <br />My work focuses on the human figure.
