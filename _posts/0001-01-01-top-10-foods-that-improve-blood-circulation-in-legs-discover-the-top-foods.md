Potassium-Rich Foods.<br />Potassium is a vasoactive mineral that increases blood flow, by widening blood vessels to the organs and limbs, resulting in reduced pain, and increased nutrient and oxygen flow.<br /><br />9. Vitamin D Sources.<br />The anti-inflammatory effects of vitamin D prevent arteries, veins, and capillaries, and the heart from oxidative damage caused by metabolic processes and environmental pollutants.<br /><br />8. Fish as a Source of Omega-3.<br />Omega-3 shows antioxidant effects by preventing oxidative damage to the blood vessels and heart. It also helps relax the muscle cells of blood vessels, which increase blood flow, and lower blood pressure.<br /><br />7. Grapes and Red Wine.<br />Grape is a rich source of polyphenols which are potent antioxidants. Also, they modulate LDL, also known as &quot;bad cholesterol&quot;, therefore preventing clotting in arteries.<br /><br />6. Tea Which Contains Catechins.<br />Drinking 1 or more cups of black or green tea daily, has been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases because of their effects on lowering blood pressure.<br /><br />5. Cacao and Dark Chocolate.<br />Even in serious cardiovascular problems, cacao supplementation showed beneficial effects on the dilation of arteries.<br /><br />4. Garlic as a Rich Source of L-arginine.<br />Garlic is rich in L-arginine, an amino acid that is critical for nitric oxide synthesis, which helps blood vessels relax.<br /><br />3. Green Leafy Vegetables.<br />A higher intake of green vegetables is associated with a healthier venous system. Studies have shown that healthy people who ate spinach had higher dilation of blood vessels, indicating increased flow to the organs.<br /><br />2. Cayenne Pepper.<br />It affects metabolism, resulting in increased flow in arteries and veins. It also improves common lipid problems such as high triglyceride and cholesterol levels. <br /><br />1. Vitamin C.<br />Vitamin C has beneficial effects on arteries through its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.<br /><br />For tips to optimize your health, nutrition and lifestyle so you can feel amazing naturally, Subscribe→ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dailyhealthpost.co/subscribe">https://dailyhealthpost.co/subscribe</a><br /><br /><br />Timestamps<br />-----------<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:32 Potassium-Rich Foods.<br />01:17 Vitamin D Sources.<br />02:18 Fish as a Source of Omega-3.<br />03:01 Grapes and Red Wine.<br />03:40 Tea Which Contains Catechins.<br />04:29 Cacao and Dark Chocolate.<br />05:02 Garlic as a Rich Source of L-arginine.<br />05:36 Green Leafy Vegetables.<br />06:23 Cayenne Pepper.<br />06:52 Vitamin C.<br /><br />Are you experiencing symptoms of poor circulation?
