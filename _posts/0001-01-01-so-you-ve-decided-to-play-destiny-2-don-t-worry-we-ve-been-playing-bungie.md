{% raw %}Don't worry. We've been playing Bungie's pinnacle loot shooter and have a comprehensive catch-up guide for all new and returning players alike, eager to play Destiny with the upcoming launch of The Witch Queen!<br /><br />Destiny 2 is a constantly evolving game, so if you haven’t touched it even as far back as the Shadowkeep expansion when it went free-to-play, it might be quite different from what you remember. Whether you're a new player or a returning one, we got you! We breakdown everything from what expansions you need to worry about buying, to how seasons work, and armor builds and exotic tips, just to name a few. <br /><br />The Witch Queen is at max hype right now, and this story is about to be incredible with all the build-up over the last 7 years from Destiny 1 coming to this moment. If Lightfall is like Avenger’s Endgame, then Witch Queen certainly feels like Infinity War, and I’m 100% here for it. Trust me, if you haven’t played yet or you fell off, I’m sorry to say that you missed out on some really cool shared experiences but that’s ok! Because you’re back now, and there’s, even more, to discover and experience together, and that’s all that matters. See you on the field, Guardian.<br /><br />If you would like a written lore catchup on Destiny's story so far, check out Phil Hornshaw's in depth articles here:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-the-story-so-far-from-the-black-garden-to-beyond-light/1100-6452481/">https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-the-story-so-far-from-the-black-garden-to-beyond-light/1100-6452481/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-story-catch-up-everything-that-happened-from-beyond-light-to-witch-queen/1100-6500256/">https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-story-catch-up-everything-that-happened-from-beyond-light-to-witch-queen/1100-6500256/</a><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />00:00 - Intro<br />02:17 - What to buy?<br />03:56 - How do Seasons work?<br />05:17 - How do I catch up on story?<br />07:33 - How Do I catch up on power level?<br />08:06 - How much can I play solo vs. with friends?<br />10:19 - Should I keep my old character or start a new one?<br />11:08 - What guns and armor should I be trying to get?<br />14:18 - How do armor builds even work?<br />18:19 - Why Are Void and Statis classes different?<br />19:11 - How do I get exotics?<br />20:35 - Will it take a long time to have a high level character?<br />21:35 - What activities and modes are actually worth playing?{% endraw %}
