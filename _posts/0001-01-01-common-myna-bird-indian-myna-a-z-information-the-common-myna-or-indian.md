{% raw %}The common myna or Indian myna (Acridotheres tristis), sometimes spelled mynah, is a member of the family Sturnidae (starlings and mynas) native to Asia. An omnivorous open woodland bird with a strong territorial instinct, the common myna has adapted extremely well to urban environments.<br /><br />The range of the common myna is increasing at such a rapid rate that in 2000 the IUCN Species Survival Commission declared it one of the world's most invasive species and one of only three birds listed among &quot;100 of the World's Worst Invasive Species&quot; that pose a threat to biodiversity, agriculture and human interests. In particular, the species poses a serious threat to the ecosystems of Australia, where it was named &quot;The Most Important.<br />Description<br />The common myna is readily identified by the brown body, black hooded head and the bare yellow patch behind the eye. The bill and legs are bright yellow. There is a white patch on the outer primaries and the wing lining on the underside is white. The sexes are similar and birds are usually seen in pairs.<br /><br />The common myna obeys Gloger's rule in that the birds from northwestern India tend to be paler than their darker counterparts in southern India.<br />Can common mynah birds talk?<br />Image result for common myna<br />Speech and Vocalizations<br /><br />Hill and common mynahs are renowned for their ability to mimic the human voice. They can learn up to 100 words. The key to teaching your bird to talk is repetition and patience.<br />#CommonMyna #IndianMyna #AcridotheresTristis{% endraw %}
