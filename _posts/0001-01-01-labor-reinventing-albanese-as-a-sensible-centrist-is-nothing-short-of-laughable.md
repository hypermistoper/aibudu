{% raw %}Labor's determination to reinvent Anthony Albanese as some &quot;fiscally conservative moderate who rejects wokeness&quot; is nothing short of laughable, says Sky News host Rita Panahi.<br /><br />Ms Panahi said the Labor Party has been largely successful at reimagining Mr Albanese as a sensible centrist while hiding the fact he is really &quot;hard socialist left&quot; to his core.<br /><br />&quot;If you believe that then you'll believe anything,&quot; Ms Panahi said.<br /><br />&quot;If Anthony Albanese becomes PM it'll be because he has successfully hoodwinked the Australian population ... but the public always figures you out in the end.&quot;{% endraw %}
