{% raw %}Hi Everyone,<br /><br />Here are the basic consistencies you will use to outline and flood your cookies. Using the royal icing recipe from my previous video, I thin down the icing using small amounts of water at a time. In the video I use a dropper to show you that you do not need too much water to change the icing consistency. You can use a teaspoon or a spray bottle as well, whatever works for you!<br /><br />I like to use 2 consistencies, the first is a thicker one to outline my cookie. This way it keeps the icing from flowing over the edge of the cookie, gives you nice sharp corners and makes the icing have that nice puffy look. This outline icing can also be used to make details on your cookie. <br /><br />The second consistency is the flood icing. Flood means to fill the cookie with icing. I like my icing to be on the looser side, so that it settles on it´s own and don´t have to jiggle it to get it smoothe. It gives you that nice even finished look.<br /><br />Always remember, if your icing is too thick, take it out of the piping bag and add more water. If it´s too thin, add more powedered sugar. The more you practice the more you will learn what consistency works best for you. <br /><br />Happy cookie decorating!{% endraw %}
