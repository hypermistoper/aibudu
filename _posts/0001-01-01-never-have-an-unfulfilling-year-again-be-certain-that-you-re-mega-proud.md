I'm Emma.<br />__<br /><br />I'm a psychotherapist who lives, breathes and eats the science of joyfulness, wellness and achievement. I'm the Founder of A Life I Choose, a self-development agency that guides clients to amplify their strengths so they can overcome any challenge and create the life they really want.<br /><br />All the strategy sessions, workshops and talks I give are fuelled by my deep wish to belong to a world where people actively choose their lives! A person without choice is an unhappy individual. A person who passionately and resiliently lives their purpose experiences joy and fulfilment daily.<br /><br />If you're like me and you see that the more people are actively engaging in life, the happier our world will be, then we need you to be a beacon of this message by living it! My YouTube channel is one of my ways of creating dialogue with you, so that together, we can have a greater impact on our world.{% endraw %}
