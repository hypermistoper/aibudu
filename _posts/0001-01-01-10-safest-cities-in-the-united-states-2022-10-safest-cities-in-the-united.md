{% raw %}10 Safest Cities in The United States. 2022<br /><br />The FBI just came out with the latest stats on crime in the United States, so I thought we could take a look at the safest cities in the United State with a population of over 100k residents. <br />  If you live in a small town or small city of let's say 20k or fewer residents it is sort of easy to have a low violent crime rate. When you get into the 100k or more area it gets hard to do. The cities on this list have done a great job keeping violent crime very low.  <br />Most of these cities are out west in Arizona, California, Texas, and even one in Illinois.<br />Everyone wants to find that place where they can feel safe, this list is a good place to start your search for a safe place in the United States.<br /><br /><br /><br />🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹🔹<br /> 🔶My Other Channels: <br />    🟥  On This Day  <br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs9MGJ6xVKLKG_YsQkQNLjg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs9MGJ6xVKLKG_YsQkQNLjg</a><br />    🟥     According To Briggs <br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBkk4NYCe6f7sW4TU6_YO-w">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBkk4NYCe6f7sW4TU6_YO-w</a><br /><br /> <br />  <br /><br />#UnitedStates<br /> #Crime<br /><br /><br /><br />❤Things You should watch or listen to:<br />    Hermens Outdoors:<br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgEIwkmBTuhy6Djx6XipM3g">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgEIwkmBTuhy6Djx6XipM3g</a><br />   <br />    Kimmie the Explorer:<br />    <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF88qxZPdAfeBVDR2WOjVyg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCF88qxZPdAfeBVDR2WOjVyg</a><br /><br />Business &amp; Voice over email: World2Briggs@gmail.com<br /><br />Mailing Address:   World According to Briggs<br />                                 20449 SW Tualatin Valley Hwy<br />                                 # 354<br />                                 Aloha, Oregon 97003{% endraw %}
