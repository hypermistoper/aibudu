{% raw %}Hello to all young painters and not only üë©‚Äçüé® Today we have a very creative and interesting art tutorial. And even if you have never held a brush in your hands, it doesn't matter. Because we don't really need it! We have prepared 3 cool and simple drawing techniques for you that are easy to repeat.<br /><br />üé® 00:43 - Incredible 3D painting! For this, we need traditional materials, like the acrylic paints and a painting knife. Just squeeze the paints of different colors onto the palette and create one 3D smudge after another! The result is gonna be amazing! And the most interesting thing is that by mixing colors on the palette you're gonna get one more unusual picture.<br /><br />üåπ 03:52 - Pink roses, painted with a q-tip! Our second painting is gonna be completely flowery! First of all, we'll create a blue background. Then we'll add pink circles with the yellow dots inside. Next, we'll take a q-tip, move it in a spiral and get gorgeous 3D roses!<br /><br />üåà 07:06 - Painting with a comb! Guys, get ready - it's gonna be messy! An easel won't do this time. The canvas should be lying flat. Pour the paint into plastic cups, and then pour it out on the canvas drawing wide lines. And here's the most interesting part! All you need is to run a comb through the paint stripes and then you'll get an awesome result!<br /><br />It looks like we have an amazing mini-art gallery, which will undoubtedly be replenished with new items! Guys, be sure to try these techniques at home. Feel free to use different colors and experiment! Maybe you will create an even cooler painting method!<br /><br />More fascinating art tutorials here:<br /><br />Amazing Ocean Wave Acrylic Painting <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/4oaHwYTNRjs">https://youtu.be/4oaHwYTNRjs</a><br /><br />How To Make An Unusual Te Fiti Picture From Wooden Sticks <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/jz6h20_1zhE">https://youtu.be/jz6h20_1zhE</a><br /><br />Making A Clock In The Style Of Animated Film &quot;My Neighbor Totoro&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9G7Yoyp4Vko">https://youtu.be/9G7Yoyp4Vko</a> <br /><br />This video has English subtitles for your convenience!<br /><br />Check out Slime Sam‚Äôs Community Tab and see his best pictures, funny GIFs, new episode announcements and much more! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw5VDXH8up3pKUppIvcstNQ/community">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw5VDXH8up3pKUppIvcstNQ/community</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Sam‚Äôs channel and give a thumbs up to motivate him to make more videos for you! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/zarVZo">https://goo.gl/zarVZo</a><br /><br />All product and company names shown in the video are trademarks‚Ñ¢ or registered¬Æ trademarks of their respective holders.
