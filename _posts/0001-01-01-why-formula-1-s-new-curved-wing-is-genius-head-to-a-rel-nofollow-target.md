This new car design is properly genius - so let‚Äôs unpack it. <br /><br />Formula 1 unveiled a full-size version of the new car recently, and it looks radically different to the current cars. Now, a lot of this is about improving the looks of the cars but mainly to do with improving racing. <br /><br />But despite the crazy livery, the thing that caught my eye was the rear wing. We have never seen anything like this before - normally wings are boxy rather than curved like this, and for good reason! <br /><br />So is this new look an aesthetic change, or to do with actually improving overtaking. Well, it turns out, the reasoning is genius.<br /><br />Thanks to the following channels, go check them out!<br />ABB Formula E  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/FIAFormulaE">https://www.youtube.com/c/FIAFormulaE</a><br />Formula Addict <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmbfmFGEAwnv9IkZO3ZPzPg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmbfmFGEAwnv9IkZO3ZPzPg</a><br />MAXF1 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv4acQqzrEsNtuvcBQmsVlA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCv4acQqzrEsNtuvcBQmsVlA</a><br />F1 video warehouse <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYC6em9fCQGT5ZiSfY7Ppxg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYC6em9fCQGT5ZiSfY7Ppxg</a><br />Race Sim Studio <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/RaceSimStudio">https://www.youtube.com/c/RaceSimStudio</a><br />Atif Masood <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/waraich221">https://www.youtube.com/user/waraich221</a><br />FingerPilote 237 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfuLdwiYAiu_InTDuPg7V6A">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfuLdwiYAiu_InTDuPg7V6A</a><br />Stefeliga Flavius <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/StefeligaFlavius">https://www.youtube.com/c/StefeligaFlavius</a><br />FIA <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/FIAOfficialVideo">https://www.youtube.com/user/FIAOfficialVideo</a><br /><br />‚û§ Subscribe for more incredible motorsport: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/AbD2f9">https://goo.gl/AbD2f9</a><br /><br />‚û§Follow us on:<br />   ‚û§ Instagram- @official_driver61 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/D61Insta">https://bit.ly/D61Insta</a><br />   ‚û§TikTok - @official_driver61 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/D61TikTok">https://bit.ly/D61TikTok</a><br /><br />‚û§ iPad Drawing sponsored by Concepts, you can get an exclusive free trial here!
