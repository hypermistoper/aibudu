{% raw %}While there is no one-size-fits-all cure for recovering from CFS, there are a number of things you can do to improve symptoms. However, it's important to note that it takes more than just one thing, or just one &quot;brain training&quot; exercise to fully recover from chronic fatigue syndrome. There is a common misconception that if you just find this one special brain retraining exercise it will make all your problems go away. That is not the case. You need to fully understand the root causes in order to fix this nervous system problem for good. By incorporating a variety of different exercises into your treatment plan, you can give yourself the best chance of making a full recovery.<br /><br />————————————————————————————————————<br />WANT TO SPEED UP RECOVERY?
