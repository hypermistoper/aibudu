{% raw %}Limassol Road passing some 5 star Hotels, some was accidentally cut out while editing by mistake.<br />Enjoy the scenery while driving the Limassol coastal road from St. Raphael Resort and Marina going all the way down to the Town Center passing all the 5 star Hotels along the way and the construction of Trilogy, and picking up my son going to school and arriving at home.<br /><br />Please watch until the end like and share and do not forget to subscribe and hit the notification bell to inform you for my new upload.
