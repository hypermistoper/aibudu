{% raw %}SARGODHA BOARD , RAWALPINDI BOARD , FAISALABAD BOARD , MULTAN BOARD<br />Chromatography:<br /> Chromatography is a physical method of separation in which the components to be separated are distributed between two phases.<br />Stationary phase :<br /> One of which is stationary (stationary phase) <br />Mobile phase :<br /> (the mobile phase) moves through it in a definite direction.<br /><br />Retardation Factor / Relative Flow ( Rf value ) <br /> The chromatographic process occurs due to differences in the distribution constant of the individual sample components<br />Works by allowing the molecules present in the mixture to distribute themselves between a stationary and  a mobile medium. <br />A method of partition chromatography using filter paper strips as carrier or inert support.<br /><br />The factor governing separation of mixtures of solutes on filter paper is the partition between two immiscible phases.<br /><br />One is usually water adsorbed on cellulose fibres in the paper (stationary phase).<br />The second is the organic solvent flows past the sample on the paper (stationary phase).{% endraw %}
