{% raw %}Galen Emanuele on &quot;Improv to be a Better Human Being&quot; (Yes, and...) at  the inaugural TEDxBellingham event on November 12th, 2013.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.tedxbellingham.com">http://www.tedxbellingham.com</a><br /><br />As the president of Shift Yes, Galen transforms organizations  by showing them how to apply the principles of improv to be more successful in business and life. <br /><br />He has been performing and teaching all levels of performance and applied improv for almost 10 years, and has over 16 years experience in sales and marketing. He spends his time making the world more awesome by providing staff development workshops and keynotes for tons of different organizations and thousands of people. He also started Pass The Hat, a brilliant non-profit that provides financial relief to local families facing tragedy. <br /><br />In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations){% endraw %}
