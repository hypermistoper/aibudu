The whole world is talking about it.<br /><br />The attack launched by Russia on February 24, on the territory of neighboring Ukraine, on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin, continues without slowing down. Since the beginning of the offensive, Russia has attacked in two forms. <br /><br />At the beginning of the war, the Russian army, which started attacks across Ukraine, could not achieve the desired success, so it changed tactics and focused entirely on the east of Ukraine and the freedom of Donbass.
