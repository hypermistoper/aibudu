{% raw %}This is making me feel the BIGness of all that we are...it´s making me feel this Leading-Edge-ness that we´re experiencing. <br />There is no separation between that which men call god and us! <br />We are source energy in a physical body and we came forth into OUR time-space-reality for one thing, and one thing only.....feeling good in the expansion of this universe...<br />feeling good....feeling good!I <br /><br />I never felt it more than in Phoenix (where I took part in the vibrational Mix via Live Broadcast) ...so....I made a new Mix...<br />Now, I can dwell in that feeling easily, no matter where I am. <br /><br />I hope you enjoy it like I do !!! <br /><br /><br />Thank you Esther, you´re such an incredible woman and words aren´t accurate enough to express what I feel for you. But one thing is for sure: I love you ♥<br />Thank you Jerry, I can hear your laughter easily. Your sifting and sorting brought clarity to so many of us. You´re a death-less Hero forever ♥<br />Thank you Abraham for enjoying us out here on the Leading Edge! We love it too to visit with you ;D ♥<br /><br /><br />Workshop: 2011-12-10 Phoenix, AZ<br />Music: &quot;Transformers&quot; - Soundtrack (Prod.By YungBrooke)<br />Artwork: Sanjay Debnath (thank you brother ♥){% endraw %}
