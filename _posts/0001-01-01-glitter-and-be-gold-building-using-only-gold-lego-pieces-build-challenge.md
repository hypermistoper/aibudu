{% raw %}It‚Äôs time for a Too Much Gold build, more like ‚ÄúNot Enough Gold how am I gonna do this OMG?‚Äù build üò¨. There are not a whole lot of gold pieces in Lego, it‚Äôs mostly used as an accent colour (unless you‚Äôre building the Infinity Gauntlet and then it‚Äôs alllllll gold). But I don‚Äôt have that one, so here we are with limited pieces and a build challenge on our hands. Can I make something cohesive? It‚Äôs not looking likely. It‚Äôd be handy to be King Midas right about now‚Ä¶..<br /><br />If you've just dropped by, I'm Ellie! Lego is an artistic medium and no matter your building expertise there is something here for everyone. Stick around and I'll build for you while I review new sets and create my own customs (MOCs). I tend to geek out about new pieces, get excited about learning new and interesting building techniques, giggle too much and just generally ramble. I'm easily distracted so things can get a bit hectic, but I'm sure you're down for that. <br /><br />And don't forget that you can also get an ellieV t-shirt and other stuff from here! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/elliev-toys-merch">https://teespring.com/stores/elliev-toys-merch</a><br /><br />Custom Lego builds <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hgnLedbBos&amp;list=PL45mCZb2me0pt9TfD9WTj6zF9AhB62a7G">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1hgnLedbBos&amp;list=PL45mCZb2me0pt9TfD9WTj6zF9AhB62a7G</a><br />Lego minidoll repaints <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPROmVNC82Q&amp;list=PL45mCZb2me0otfELv9K6oQBQqUSGYdsZZ">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPROmVNC82Q&amp;list=PL45mCZb2me0otfELv9K6oQBQqUSGYdsZZ</a><br />Too Much single colour build challenge <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvq4UywOHxc&amp;list=PL45mCZb2me0qPiDEIPDfEjY3w9SoNuEyj">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gvq4UywOHxc&amp;list=PL45mCZb2me0qPiDEIPDfEjY3w9SoNuEyj</a><br /><br />Please subscribe and like if you enjoy - I appreciate every single one of your views!<br /><br />Music - Picture this (audioblocks){% endraw %}
