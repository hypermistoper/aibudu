{% raw %}Past Due track 02. Thanks to rocketman0739 for providing high-quality versions of these songs.<br />Download the album here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://archive.org/details/filk_past_due">https://archive.org/details/filk_past_due</a><br />------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />[book: Crystal Singer series, Anne McCaffrey]<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />The whirlwind of the morning air harmoniously sighs<br />And echoes from the facets of the cliffs into the skies<br />We singers of the crystal must begin another day<br />Forgetting all the beauty in our need to make it pay<br /><br />The sled may lift us far above the walls of crystal stone<br />And we may not remember all the claims we've called our own—<br />But now we fly and now we sing and listen for the sound<br />Of crystal veins that sing reply from cold and barren ground<br /><br />Though I have flown a thousand miles and still must fly as far<br />I now recall the place I found my pure black crystal spar!<br />My comp reminds me as I fly of things that I must do<br />And warns me of the dangers that may keep me from my due<br /><br />Suddenly the bells ring out, the whine assails my ears<br />A sonic storm is moving in—sled, get me out of here!<br />The skies light up, the blasts of wind are rising to a peak<br />And every passing moment takes me from the black I seek<br /><br />Racing the wind, running from the storm,<br />Escaping from the violence to a shelter safe and warm<br />The storm moves ever faster, and ever louder calls<br />The sled gives out an anguished cry as to the storm it falls<br /><br />I waken to the howl of wind resounding in my ears<br />The nurse the Guild provides for me stands forth to dry my tears<br />She cannot understand my weeping or the reason why—<br />I have forgotten once again where my black crystals lie<br /><br />We singers of the crystal live for over eightscore years<br />But you who live a shorter span can never know our fears<br />Your memories may reach across a gulf ours cannot span—<br />Remembering makes you the life and me the empty man<br /><br />The sled may lift us far above the walls of crystal stone<br />And we may not remember all the things we've called our own—<br />But now we fly and now we sing and listen for the sound<br />Of crystal veins that sing reply from cold and barren ground{% endraw %}
