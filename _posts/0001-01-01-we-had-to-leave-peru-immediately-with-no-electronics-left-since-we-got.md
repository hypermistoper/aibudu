{% raw %}With no electronics left, since we got robbed in our hotel room, we were sitting round Lima-- not earning money, and still spending money. So, we decided to leave Peru after we got robbed near Machu Picchu.<br />Unfortunately we didn't make it to Machu Picchu, even though we bought train and entrance tickets,  and guide. What a pity.<br />Anyway, I think we made the right decision to come back to our hometown, and surprised both of our moms. Their reactions made our long and expensive trip home worth it.<br />We hadn't been home in 3 years after all. We will regroup, buy vlogging equipment, and see our families and friends. Let us know what you would like to see from Toronto, Canada!<br /><br />And thanks so much you guys, for all your support. We really have the best community‚ù§Ô∏è And special thanks to those who gave us &quot;thanks&quot; and bought us coffeesüôè<br />A few of you also want to help us via Gofundme.
