{% raw %}Hello Darlings, <br />       It’s been a long time. I’ve had a pretty demoralizing few years living in isolation. There’s been a lot of hope and disappointment. A lot of setting up tours and canceling them. I’ve managed to muddle my way through the last two years, but like many of us the exhaustion of living this way has taken its toll. My mental health has taken a beating and I’ve been living off savings throughout this ordeal. I’m definitely nearing the end of my rope with I’m able to do, and the finish line continues to move farther away. Having said all that I think we still need a dose of hope to help us get through this. I wrote this piece as the pandemic was starting, but two years in I think it’s relevant as we move into a new year. Big thanks to Mark Bérubé for the music, and huge love to Abbey Doucet for putting this video together under such a time crunch. I’m wishing you all the very best and hope to see you in 2022. Love to you and yours.<br />Cheers<br />        Shane<br /><br />&quot;A Tomorrow&quot; Written and performed by Shane Koyczan<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shanekoyczan.com">https://www.shanekoyczan.com</a> | @shane_koyczan on Instagram<br />Music Written and performed by Mark Berube | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kliffs.ca">https://www.kliffs.ca</a><br />Video Editor: Abbey Doucet<br />Audio / Audio Editor / Video Mix: Christopher Cleater<br />Special Video Thanks: Keaton Lawlor, Matteo Welsh, Mt Seymour<br /><br />#poetry #spokenword #newyearseve #happynewyear #tomorrow #shanekoyczan #markberube #abbeydoucet #youtube #reddit #2022 #2021 #covid #omicron #delta #thanks #gratitude #hope #art #family #friends #science #justice #itgetsbetter #future #apesstrongtogether #amc #didhejustsneakthatinthere? #hetotallydid #thesehashtagsareoutofcontrol #hashtag #ibetterstopnow #but #nicholascage #deservesanominationfor #pig #wtf #whyishestillgoing? #omg #hecantbestopped #like #theterminator #also #anthonyjeselnik #hasgreatbookreccomendations #loved #Antkind #by #charliekaufman #and #sidenote #benaffleck #waslookingathisphoneduringmy #teldtalk{% endraw %}
