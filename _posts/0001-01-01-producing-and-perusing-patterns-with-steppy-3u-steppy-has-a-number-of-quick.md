{% raw %}Steppy has a number of quick and easy shortcuts to create patterns, but can also store up to 8 patterns. Steppy will automatically reload the last saved or loaded pattern the next time it powers up. Saved patterns are great for creating basic rhythms to use as departure points, or to set up the structure of a song or live set in advance.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/steppy/">https://intellijel.com/shop/eurorack/steppy/</a><br /><br />#eurorack #modular #synthesizer #intellijel #quantizer{% endraw %}
