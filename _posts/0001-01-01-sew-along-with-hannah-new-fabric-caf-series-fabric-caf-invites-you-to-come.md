{% raw %}Fabric CafÃ© invites you to come Sew Along with Hannah on March 29th as Hannah makes her second 3-yard quilt - Stepping Stones! This will be a 5 part series that will take you from start to finish making a 3-yard quilt with one of our most popular patterns! You can also get the 3-yard quilt kit that Hannah used &quot;Fresh as a Daisy&quot; at our website, or if you have 3-yards of fabric then you can use your own because all of our patterns only use three 1-yard cuts of fabric to make! Happy quilting!<br /><br />Hannah's First Quilt Playlist - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGrocj6mKnJ8PU9ZxYMq3MK8CY9bulfHq">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGrocj6mKnJ8PU9ZxYMq3MK8CY9bulfHq</a><br />------------------------------------------------<br />ðŸ§µ Featured Quilt Kits and Bundles - <br />Fresh as a Daisy - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fabriccafe.com/Fresh-as-a-Daisy-3-Yard-Quilt-Kit-p/8021698.htm">https://www.fabriccafe.com/Fresh-as-a-Daisy-3-Yard-Quilt-Kit-p/8021698.htm</a><br />Hannah's Pick Backing - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fabriccafe.com/Fresh-As-A-Daisy-Backing-p/55220211-b.htm">https://www.fabriccafe.com/Fresh-As-A-Daisy-Backing-p/55220211-b.htm</a><br />------------------------------------------------<br />ðŸ§µ DISCOVER MORE -<br />â–¶ Free Pattern | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fabriccafe.com/Boomerang-Free-3-Yard-Quilt-Pattern-p/092131-free.htm">https://www.fabriccafe.com/Boomerang-Free-3-Yard-Quilt-Pattern-p/092131-free.htm</a><br />â–¶ Sign up for our Newsletter | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fabriccafe.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=978e8336bbdba0154afb83164&amp;id=0ebb7b3da7">https://fabriccafe.us4.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=978e8336bbdba0154afb83164&amp;id=0ebb7b3da7</a><br />â–¶ SUBSCRIBE | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/SubscribeTodayFabricCafe">https://bit.ly/SubscribeTodayFabricCafe</a><br />â–¶ Quilting Free Goodies | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fabriccafe.com/Free-Goodies-s/1916.htm">https://www.fabriccafe.com/Free-Goodies-s/1916.htm</a><br />------------------------------------------------<br />ðŸ§µ SHOP TODAY - <br />â–¶ Webstore | www.fabriccafe.com<br />â–¶ Clearance Sale | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fabriccafe.com/Clearance-Sale-s/1925.htm">https://www.fabriccafe.com/Clearance-Sale-s/1925.htm</a><br />â–¶ 3-Yard Quilt Kits | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fabriccafe.com/3-yard-quilt-kits-s/1830.htm">https://www.fabriccafe.com/3-yard-quilt-kits-s/1830.htm</a><br />â–¶ Fabric CafÃ¨ Quilt Patterns and Books | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fabriccafe.com/patterns-and-books-s/1817.htm">https://www.fabriccafe.com/patterns-and-books-s/1817.htm</a><br />â–¶ Notions &amp; Tools | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fabriccafe.com/notions-and-tools-s/1836.htm">https://www.fabriccafe.com/notions-and-tools-s/1836.htm</a><br />------------------------------------------------<br />If you like what you see, consider subscribing to our channel or visiting our website!
