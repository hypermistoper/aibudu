{% raw %}Just sharing my personal experience on importing products from China to sell on my eCommerce Website &amp; Amazon FBA. I will explain the process I went through to actually create my own private label product. (P.S. Smash that like button - If this video is helpful!)<br /><br />And finally give some recommendations and tips, so you can hopefully learn from some of my mistakes, save money, save time and know what to expect!<br /><br />eCommerce Tutorial (Create your own online store): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rNLO9zG9BLk">https://youtu.be/rNLO9zG9BLk</a><br /><br />Tips &amp; Recommendations<br /><br />1. Check your insurance premiums before hand - because for certain product it may be quiet high and you need to take that into account when calculating your selling price and profit margins. Especially for things people put on their skin, into their mouth etc.<br /><br />2. Check your country regulations (labelling, shipping, customs) - This is important because not all products can be shipped, certain percentages of ingredients may be limited for products. You may need labelling requirements. for ex.&quot;Warning: Not intended for Use for Child Under 12&quot;<br /><br />3. Get a Factory Audit or Self Assessed Factory Audit - This is important because when you're getting product liability insurance, you will be asked for certain information regarding quality control etc. But It's also important to know the capabilities of the factory - so that they are able to produce superior quality products.<br /><br />4. Budget at least 3-6 months - The time from searching for suppliers to actually having the product in your hand ready to sell will take a lot of time. Emails, samples, testing, researching, problems, discussing terms/payments, negotiating, production, shipping and inspection will take a while. So manage your expectations and have enough cash to last you at least 3+ months. And also sales may not come instantly, it will take some time to build up your brand.<br /><br />5. Download WeChat - Alot faster to communicate with them. Much faster than email and they'll even reply you during non-business hours!<br /><br />6. Check out the GoodLife Warrior Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBmELdKuL34d0x3LBX31Pxg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBmELdKuL34d0x3LBX31Pxg</a> (really amazing information <br /><br />7. Read/Listen to the Book &quot;Poorly Made in China&quot; - This can help you understand the cultural differences and help you better manage and negotiate with suppliers from China<br /><br />8. And Finally - Don't be afraid to fail! You're going to make mistakes even if you watch 100 videos, just keep on moving forward. Don't get stuck on the dream, take action today!<br /><br />P.S. Ensure you do comprehensive product testing. Longer durations &amp; different conditions. Personally, I was too excited about the packaging and how I could now design my own lil product with my own brand name on it! So don't make that mistake :)<br /><br />My Recording Equipment: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/hoganchua">https://www.amazon.com/shop/hoganchua</a><br /><br />Resources<br />Video Finding REAL Manufacturers on Alibaba: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJDR1_I1aYU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJDR1_I1aYU</a><br />Poorly Made in China: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2YhOP9y">https://amzn.to/2YhOP9y</a><br />Inspection Company I Used: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.qima.com">https://www.qima.com</a><br /><br />Please LIKE and Subscribe for More Videos!{% endraw %}
