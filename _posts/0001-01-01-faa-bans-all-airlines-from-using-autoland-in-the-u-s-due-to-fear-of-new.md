{% raw %}Even tho Europe has been flying with 5G for some time now the U.S. is still reluctant to let Airlines land planes in the U.S. with autoland due to fears of what the new 5G cellular network rollout may do to altimeters.  Is this a real fear or just more political red tape? <br />*** See pinned comment regarding my misspelling of Unions.
