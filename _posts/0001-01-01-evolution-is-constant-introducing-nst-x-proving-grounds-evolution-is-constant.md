{% raw %}Evolution is constant. Powered by riders and inspired by terrain, Natural Selection and Proving Grounds are forging a partnership to evolve mountain bike competition and foster progression in the same way Natural Selection is doing for snowboarding. The partnership will meld what we’ve each started on snow &amp; dirt and will provide both riders and fans with an experience like no other. In partnership with Natural Selection, Proving Grounds will livestream worldwide on NaturalSelectionTour.com , Sept 8-11 from Prineville, Oregon.{% endraw %}
