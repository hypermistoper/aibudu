{% raw %}Tuesday night wasn‚Äôt a brilliant watch was it? Yet AFC Bournemouth uploaded their match report with the headline ‚ÄúChristie leveller puts Bournemouth back up to second‚Äù - a short factual title which glossed over the context, as it was a performance which left many Cherries fans scratching their heads.<br /><br />On this video, Sam Davis and Tom Jordan are at The Pear at Parley to unpick some of the issues with the Cherries that we‚Äôre confused by, as well as listing the things that we‚Äôre just not quite understanding,.<br /><br />Is it the culture, the manager, the players, or is it us - the fans?<br /><br />Contribute to the Ukraine Humanitarian Appeal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://donation.dec.org.uk/ukraine-humanitarian-appeal">https://donation.dec.org.uk/ukraine-humanitarian-appeal</a><br /><br />Visit the Pear at Parley at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thepearatparley.com/">https://thepearatparley.com/</a><br /><br />#AFCB #EFL #AFCBOURNEMOUTH<br /><br />üëç AGREE OR DISAGREE üëé<br /><br /><br /><br />If you have any comments about what is said in this video, leave a comment.
