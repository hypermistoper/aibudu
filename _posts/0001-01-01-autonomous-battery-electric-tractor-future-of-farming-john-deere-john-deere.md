{% raw %}John Deere developed an autonomous and all-electric agricultural machine. The full functionality of this agricultural machine as a standard tractor was successfully tested in the field. Explore more about the tractor of the future.<br /><br />Electrification and automation are already major subjects in agricultural developments. Driven by the transformation in the car industry and the legal regulations in relation to combustion driven vehicles, the electrification of machines becomes more important for agriculture machine manufacturers. A key aspect of this strategy is the self-use of electricity. This makes farmers independent of rising fuel prices.<br /><br />John Deere proudly presents the innovative and publicly funded project GridCON 2. This project ties in the results of past innovations and examines the approach of a battery electric tractor without limitations in terms of operating time. Therefore, a battery module with a total capacity of 1000 kWh is installed. This allows the tractor to work productively for a full workday without charging, depending on the use case. In addition, the offboarding of electric power up to 1000 kW for electrified implements or other electrically driven machines in an agricultural swarm system is possible. Due to the power density of the electric motors, the system power of the tractor is increased significantly in comparison to the standard tractor platform resulting in a higher productivity.<br /><br />The project GridCON 2 stands for the consistent further development of battery electric agricultural machines to enable an emission-free farming. With this, John Deere contributes to a sustainable and efficient use of resources.<br /><br />➤ More videos about John Deere innovations and future technologies: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmXoV375YsrQwGBC2PPlKcvsSyQEczLkb">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLmXoV375YsrQwGBC2PPlKcvsSyQEczLkb</a><br /><br />➤ Are you interested in the future of farming?!
