{% raw %}After you have determined learning outcomes for your courses, whatâ€™s the next step? Learning outcomes have maximum value when combined with specific measureable methods of assessing student learning. For example, each learning outcome in a syllabus should relate to an item to be evaluated (e.g. test 20%, project 40%, etc.). Then each item should have an assessment method. This workshop highlights the breadth and scope of assessment practices that may be used to objectively measure learning.{% endraw %}
