{% raw %}When I'm thrifting, my eye is always drawn a mass of similar items.  When you can buy a bunch of books in a series or magazines of similar type, it has great potential for resell.  Here is a great example of what often catches my eye and what works for me in my store.  Enjoy!<br /><br />What is the Curator of the Lost Channel???  I'm sure you have heard the old adage &quot;one person's junk, is another's treasure&quot;.  That is the intent of being a Curator of the Lost.  Find cool stuff that is lost and make it found.   Books are my wheelhouse, but I never know what I may find when searching in the wild.  This is where I show my cool finds, give pricing comps for and from online resell, and provide ideas and tips along the way to help viewers in their own treasure hunt success.  <br /><br />Remember- when you see cool, you have to buy cool!  Enjoy being a Curator of the Lost!<br /><br />My store:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ebay.com/str/shanemcsplace">https://www.ebay.com/str/shanemcsplace</a><br /><br />#curatorofthelost<br />#onlinebookselling<br />#ebaybookseller{% endraw %}
