{% raw %}Join Coyote Peterson and guest host Julia Maria on this action-packed episode of Wild Field Trip as they get hands-on with the Evergladesâ€™ top predator - the American alligator! The Everglades Alligator Farm is an educational facility that makes the perfect setting for these two intrepid explorers to learn about the role of alligators in the ecosystem. Julia lives in the dry landlocked state of Arizona and has never seen an alligator or crocodile in real life, until now! Coyote starts Julia off with the unique experience of hatching a baby alligator from an egg! Next, they discuss the differences between alligators and crocodiles. The episode concludes with an alligator feeding frenzy as Coyote and Julia hand feed over 150 large and very hungry gators!<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:55 Everglades Alligator Farm<br />3:12 Hatching Baby Alligators<br />9:00 American Alligator Life Stages<br />9:50 Crocs Vs Gators<br />13:04 Alligator Feeding Frenzy<br />16:45 Airboat Ride{% endraw %}
