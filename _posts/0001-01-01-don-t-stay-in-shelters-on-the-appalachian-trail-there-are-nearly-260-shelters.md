{% raw %}There are nearly 260 shelters on the Appalachian Trail. A simple building that protects it’s inhabitants from the elements. In this video I give my reasons why I won’t be staying in shelters anymore. But as I mention I believe every situation should be considered based on the the condition of the shelter and tenting spots around.
