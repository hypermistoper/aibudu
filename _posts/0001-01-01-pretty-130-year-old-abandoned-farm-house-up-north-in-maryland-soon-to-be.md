{% raw %}First farm house is early 1800’s and second is late 1800’s around 1890. First house had a beautiful hand carved newel post but is sadly collapsing on itself. Really beautiful old farm houses unfortunately destined for the wrecking ball and new developments in place. Thank you for watching!{% endraw %}
