{% raw %}The 47th by Mike Bartlett until May 28th <br /><br />Last Friday I was fortunate enough to see The 47th, a political satire comedy, that was beautifully staged, acted and directed at London's Old Vic Theatre. The play normally stars Tamara Tunie, Bertie Carvel and Lydia Wilson, however I went to see the understudy run which had no other than my good friend Eva Fontaine playing Kamala Harris. <br /><br /><br /><br />It's well worth seeing - book your tickets now -<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.oldvictheatre.com/stage/event/the-47th">https://www.oldvictheatre.com/stage/event/the-47th</a><br /><br />ABOUT THE CHANNEL - We aim to become the most informative channel for those with an interest in the Creative Arts. If you work in one of the associated industries or you watching film, television and theatrical plays, they'll be something for you here. We review the products that are made and those who make them, at every level, be they actors, make-up artists, directors, writers, even boardgames designers. We thank you for subscribing and supporting our channel.<br /><br />WHO &amp; WHAT IS THE OUTCASTS CREATIVE? Founded by Actor &amp; Teacher Dickon Tolson &amp; Actor, Writer Director Lance Steen Anthony Nielsen, The Outcasts Creative started as an acting workshop &amp; grew to a group of 100 + indy creatives (mainly actors, writers and directors) who are constantly pro-active and are not part of the industry elite. The Creative also organises industry seminars, showcase projects members and online script table reads. We've also produced Off-West End Theatre productions, short films and other projects in a similar vernacular. Our remit is to produce interesting and compelling work which is often, but not exclusively set within social and political arenas. The Outcasts also run table top gaming events which incorporate some acting elements to make them more interesting for the players. We run a regular drop in acting workshops in both London &amp; Birmingham on Monday evenings from 630pm - 930pm. (we break in mid July and start again in September) What makes the London class unique is they're normally taught in tandem by both Lance &amp; Dickon who work in unison to bring the best out of the students. The first Monday of the month is always script work, normally with original scenes. The classes open to anyone over 18 years of age. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheOutcastsCreative">https://www.facebook.com/TheOutcastsCreative</a>{% endraw %}
