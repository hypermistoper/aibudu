{% raw %}Dmitry Orlov discusses the Ukraine situation and Russia undoing 30 years worth of accumulated damage, while the West punishes itself attempting to thwart Moscow. He discusses the legality of Russia's military incursion which is absolutely necessary in terms of its security. Putin's goals are to militarily neutralize Ukraine, get rid of the Nazi extremists, and form a new legal structure. Regarding energy, the U.S. can't go without Russia for more than a few months, Russia can go without the U.S. practically forever. Western hysteria threatens escalation of the conflict. Dmitry reveals the mystery of why Putin sits at the far end of the table. He feels the U.S. is destroying the dollar which will destroy American living standards. Western leaders are losing their electorate and he's concerned of the mental damage that has occurred throughout the West and thinks living in a place of social cohesion will be important.<br /><br />*Support Geopolitics &amp; Empire:<br />Donate <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geopoliticsandempire.com/donations">https://geopoliticsandempire.com/donations</a><br />Consult <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geopoliticsandempire.com/consultation">https://geopoliticsandempire.com/consultation</a><br />Become a Member <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geopoliticsandempire.com/become-member">https://geopoliticsandempire.com/become-member</a><br />Become a Sponsor <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geopoliticsandempire.com/sponsors">https://geopoliticsandempire.com/sponsors</a><br /><br />**Visit Our Sponsors<br />Nomos Time Bank <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nomos.net">https://www.nomos.net</a><br />Borderless Health Insurance <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.borderlesshealthinsurance.com">http://www.borderlesshealthinsurance.com</a><br /><br />Websites<br />Club Orlov <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cluborlov.wordpress.com">https://cluborlov.wordpress.com</a><br />Patreon <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/orlov">https://www.patreon.com/orlov</a><br />SubscribeStar <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.subscribestar.com/orlov">https://www.subscribestar.com/orlov</a><br /><br />Books<br />Books <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/Dmitry-Orlov/e/B001JSB23G/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_2?qid=1544257309&amp;sr=8-2">https://www.amazon.com/Dmitry-Orlov/e/B001JSB23G/ref=sr_ntt_srch_lnk_2?qid=1544257309&amp;sr=8-2</a><br /><br />About Dmitry Orlov<br />Dmitry Orlov is a Russian-American engineer and a writer on subjects related to “potential economic, ecological and political decline and collapse in the United States,” something he has called “permanent crisis”. Orlov believes collapse will be the result of huge military budgets, government deficits, an unresponsive political system and declining oil production.<br /><br />Orlov was born in Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg) and moved to the United States at the age of 12. He has a BS in Computer Engineering and an MA in Applied Linguistics. He was an eyewitness to the collapse of the Soviet Union over several extended visits to his Russian homeland between the late 1980s and mid-1990s.<br /><br />In 2005 and 2006 Orlov wrote a number of articles comparing the collapse-preparedness of the U.S. and the Soviet Union published on small Peak Oil related sites. Orlov’s article “Closing the ‘Collapse Gap’: the USSR was better prepared for collapse than the US” was very popular at EnergyBulletin.Net.<br /><br />Orlov’s book Reinventing Collapse:The Soviet Example and American Prospects, published in 2008, further details his views. Discussing the book in 2009, in a piece in The New Yorker, Ben McGrath wrote that Orlov describes “superpower collapse soup” common to both the U.S. and the Soviet Union: “a severe shortfall in the production of crude oil, a worsening foreign-trade deficit, an oversized military budget, and crippling foreign debt.” Orlov told interviewer McGrath that in recent months financial professionals had begun to make up more of his audience, joining “back-to-the-land types,” “peak oilers,” and those sometimes derisively called “doomers”.<br /><br />In his review of the book, commentator Thom Hartmann writes that Orlov holds that the Soviet Union hit a “soft crash” because of centralized planning in: housing, agriculture, and transportation left an infrastructure private citizens could co-opt so that no one had to pay rent or go homeless and people showed up for work, even when they were not paid. He writes that Orlov believes the U.S. will have a hard crash, more like Germany’s Weimar Republic of the 1920s.<br /><br />*Podcast intro music is from the song &quot;The Queens Jig&quot; by &quot;Musicke &amp; Mirth&quot; from their album &quot;Music for Two Lyra Viols&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://musicke-mirth.de/en/recordings.html">http://musicke-mirth.de/en/recordings.html</a> (available on iTunes or Amazon){% endraw %}
