{% raw %}Aquaponic shipping containers: The future of food? | Mike Straight, Founder &amp; CEO of FarmPod<br />Subscribe to Freethink on YouTube ►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://freeth.ink/youtube-subscribe">https://freeth.ink/youtube-subscribe</a><br />Up next ►► Vertical farms could take over the world <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/J4SaSfnHK3I">https://youtu.be/J4SaSfnHK3I</a> <br /><br />Instead of shipping food all around the world, imagine your own food coming from your farm in a shipping container, just outside your backdoor. <br /><br />That’s the vision of FarmPod, a St. Croix-based startup looking to completely redefine our relationship with food with a fully automated vertical aquaponic system. This self-contained, solar powered farming method uses a fraction of the water and space of a traditional farm, and even uses zero pesticides.

And, since the produce doesn’t need to be picked early to be shipped to a grocery store, the owner can enjoy their harvest at its peak nutritional value and taste. Produce isn’t all - FarmPod can provide an aquaponic home for tilapia, catfish, crayfish, koi, and freshwater prawns.<br /><br />FarmPod uses automated software and hardware to make their pod's aquaponics system as easy to run as possible. Mike Straight, the creator and CEO of FarmPod, wants to provide a healthy, hyper-localized source of food with a minimal carbon footprint. “We’re trying to feed the world one pod at a time by hyper-localizing farming, and taking the farm and putting it right in front of the place that needs to use it,” says Straight.<br /><br />Read the full story here ►►<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.freethink.com/series/challengers/aquaponics">https://www.freethink.com/series/challengers/aquaponics</a> <br /><br />◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠<br /><br />Read more of our stories on aquaponics and sustainable farming:<br />Vertical farms could take over the world<br /> ►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.freethink.com/series/hard-reset?media_id=avWfzm8Q">https://www.freethink.com/series/hard-reset?media_id=avWfzm8Q</a> <br />How vertical farming can save the planet and feed the world<br /> ►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.freethink.com/series/make-it-count?media_id=bEIXKavd">https://www.freethink.com/series/make-it-count?media_id=bEIXKavd</a> <br />New startup takes vertical farming underground — literally<br /> ►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.freethink.com/environment/underground-farm">https://www.freethink.com/environment/underground-farm</a> <br /><br />◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠◠<br /><br />About Freethink<br />No politics, no gossip, no cynics.
