Learn to distinguish between different types of materials that are burning and the location of the fire because using the wrong fire retardant can make a bad situation worse. For instance, pouring water on burning liquids could spread the fire further. Similarly, pouring water in or around electrical equipment could result in electrocution. Stay safe; learn to distinguish the four different classes of fire: Class A, B, C, and D.<br /><br />Course Lessons:<br />Fire Prevention in the Office<br />Introduction<br />How Fires Burn<br />Four Classes of Fire<br />Extinguishing Fires<br />Preventing Office Fires<br />Dealing with a Fire Emergency<br />Review<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.knowledgecity.com">https://www.knowledgecity.com</a> | Online Employee Training Platform.
