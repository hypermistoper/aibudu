{% raw %}quarterly contentment review: how to keep your no buy, projects and goals  on track for 2022<br /><br />Hey y'all!  In today's video I'm sharing all about the upsides and downsides of project pans. Project pans aren't for everyone (gasp!) and I know there have been moments where I felt like giving up panning altogether. Today we're talking about it all and when project panning isn't for you. If you're not a fan of project panning that's cool, and you're probably not alone.<br /><br />Thanks so much for watching!<br /><br />S U B S C R I B E:  For new videos every Tuesday, Thursday &amp; Sunday<br /><br />my etsy store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/riparidesigns">https://www.etsy.com/shop/riparidesigns</a><br />use code RIP15 for 15% off your order!<br /><br />interested in supporting the channel? you can do that here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/shawnaripari">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/shawnaripari</a><br /><br /><br />W A T C H  N E X T:<br /><br />the upsides and downsides of no buys (no buy benefits &amp; drawbacks) + how to find balance on a no buy <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/KowTeGq6_GQ">https://youtu.be/KowTeGq6_GQ</a><br /><br />April project pan update (project pan update #3) // I FINALLY finished this after 2 YEARS <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Jo5_qjsKaxM">https://youtu.be/Jo5_qjsKaxM</a><br /><br />quarterly contentment review: how to keep your no buy, projects and goals  on track for 2022 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/24QpsAMJN8g">https://youtu.be/24QpsAMJN8g</a><br /><br />C O D E S<br />Ana Luisa:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.analuisa.com/wm-shawnaripari">https://shop.analuisa.com/wm-shawnaripari</a><br /><br />static nails: $5 off at static nail <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3uDvnUU">https://bit.ly/3uDvnUU</a><br /><br />poshmark: poshmark.ca/closet/shawnaripari- use code shawnaripari for $15 CAD off your first order<br /><br />Get a $10 off coupon to use on your first purchase at Smash + Tess - CA.
