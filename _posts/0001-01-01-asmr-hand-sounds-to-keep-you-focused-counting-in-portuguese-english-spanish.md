{% raw %}Hi guys, I hope everyone is well.<br />In today's video, I try to keep you focused on what you're doing, like your work, studies, or any task you need to do. I've always thought that hand sounds perfectly match this type of need, especially in this one where the hand sounds are a little faster. Eventually, I will count from 1 to 10 using soft-spoken and whispers. And for that, I use 4 languages: Portuguese, English, German and Spanish. And before you ask me, except for Portuguese, I only know English well, I understand Spanish, but I can't speak it, and I don't know anything about German, just a few words hahaha, but I think it's cool to learn new things so here my attempt to say something with a little help from Google Translate.<br />For the hand sounds, you'll see a lot of finger tapping, snapping, finger fluttering, and hand rubbing.<br />Hope you like it ;D<br />(video looped)<br /><br />If you like and want to see more videos, please:<br />--- SUBSCRIBE --- <br />It helps me soooo much. <br />See ya! <br /><br />CONTACT ✨ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/tillyousleepasmr">https://linktr.ee/tillyousleepasmr</a><br /><br />PATREONS – Thank you!<br />⚡ Owl<br />⚡ Annie Adams<br />⚡ Tom P.<br />⚡ Lagi One<br />⚡ Brian<br />⚡ Andreas S.<br />⚡ Patrick B.<br />⚡ Amanda<br />⚡ Shane B.<br />⚡ Steve P<br />⚡ NeonConn ASMR<br />⚡ Lina<br />⚡ Sergey S. <br />⚡ Yanarsen<br />⚡ Ele S.<br />⚡ Akkarin<br />⚡ Kruppe{% endraw %}
