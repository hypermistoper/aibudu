{% raw %}The Wise Multi Currency Account (formerly TransferWise Borderless Account) is finally back! Let me walk you through this AMAZING feature that allows you to hold up to 54 currencies and send money to 80 countries in one account. Get 1 FREE international transfer up to RM 2,500: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wise.com/invite/iwh/weif84">https://wise.com/invite/iwh/weif84</a><br /><br />⬇️Timestamps:<br />0:00 Introduction<br />0:59 PROs and CONs <br />3:04 Setup Guide (for Wise Multi Currency Account)<br />4:44 Funding Guide (for Wise Multi Currency Account)<br />6:17 Wise Business<br />8:48 Funding Interactive Brokers with Wise<br /><br />🔴Wise setup &amp; funding tutorial: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ofUpdaXZZRA">https://youtu.be/ofUpdaXZZRA</a><br /><br />The Wise multi-currency account is a great option if you live abroad or travel frequently, because its foreign transaction and conversion fees are lower than what many companies charge. It's also convenient if you work for a company that pays you in a different currency than you use, or if you send or receive money from people who live in other countries. On top of that, you can hold more foreign currencies (i.e. USD, GBP, Euro, SGD, etc.) which are historically better than MYR due to the stability of those currencies!<br /><br />On the Wise website, see how much you'll pay in fees to send money to another person. The total amount depends on the currencies and payment methods (for example, a direct deposit vs. wire transfer). You'll also see the Wise fee, which includes both foreign transaction and conversion fees. Wise tells you when the money will arrive in the other account and lets you compare fees to other currency transfer services so you can see whether you're getting the best deal.<br /><br />Wise has 24/7 customer support. You can fill out a form and wait for answer, use live chat, or talk on the phone.<br /><br />Your money is as safe with Wise as it would be with any traditional bank. You can read more about how Wise is regulated in each country here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wise.com/help/articles/2932693/how-is-wise-regulated-in-each-country">https://wise.com/help/articles/2932693/how-is-wise-regulated-in-each-country</a><br /><br />Wise Business is business banking without the high rates, hidden charges, and monthly fees.
