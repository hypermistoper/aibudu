{% raw %}The recent news of Russia invading Ukraine has everyone a little on edge. We are facing some serious threats to our safety and peace. Jonathan and I sat down and evaluated the risk and came up with an action plan for our family to help mitigate the potential risks to our family. <br /><br />In this video, we share 8 action items that we feel would be worth your time to consider and implement in your life. We need to unite and be ready for whatever challenges come our way.<br /><br />These posts will give greater details on how to implement some of the action items we discussed today.
