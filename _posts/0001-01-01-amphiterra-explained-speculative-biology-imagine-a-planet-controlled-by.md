Not just terms in terms of numbers… but in terms of their position in the ecosystem.<br /><br />Amphiterra is a speculative biology project by the talented artist and writer Roxy Valdez, which imagines the incredible and surreal forms frogs might achieve if given the perfect environment to evolve. While the world of Amphiterra often looks like an alien planet, the artist imagines it’s actually an alternate timeline of Earth, where subtly different climatic conditions led to early amphibians outcompeting the first dinosaurs and protomammals. <br /><br />What creatures will develop and thrive in this drastically different history? Let’s leap back 252 million years, and begin our tour through the timeline of Amphiterra...<br /><br />0:00 ‘Amphiterra’ Explained<br />1:05 Dawn of the Frogs<br />2:03 Early Diversification<br />4:01 Bullpronk <br />4:39 Suckerlump <br />5:24 Frondel <br />6:17 Tree Frixel<br />7:07 Gliding Allo<br />8:08 Inhabited Lorge<br />9:06 Foaming Squander<br />9:53 Steppe Fraggon<br />10:30 Freeple<br />11:27 Splendid Fragon<br />12:00 Catastrophic Fragon<br />12:44 Arctic Fragon<br />13:22 Eon Toad<br />14:14 Foaming Trogglefolk<br />15:08 Outro<br /><br />Copyright Disclaimer: Under section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for “fair use” for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, education, and research.
