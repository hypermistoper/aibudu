{% raw %}Today's video is all about my recent DIY install of the Drayton Wiser Multi Zone Smart Heating System. <br /><br />This project has been two years in the planning, and was accelerated when I was contacted by Drayton recently to ask if I would be interested in trying out their system.  As I already had a Drayton Controller and Wiring Centre, and TRV valves on most of my radiators I jumped at the chance of giving it a go. <br /><br />This video is a complete run through of the installation from a DIY perspective, with hopefully all conceivable issues covered! <br /><br />You can buy me a coffee here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/charliediyte">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/charliediyte</a> or become a monthly member to unlock Discord forum membership, exclusive content and automatic entry into my FREE Monthly Giveaway.
