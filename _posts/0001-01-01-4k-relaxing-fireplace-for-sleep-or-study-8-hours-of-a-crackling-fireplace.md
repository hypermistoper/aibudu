{% raw %}Hi, this is a high resolution high quality render of a 4K fireplace, the fire is also 3D simulation made on my PC. <br />So enjoy this 4K relaxing fireplace, I hope this helps you get some sleep, or study, or whatever else you want to do whilst having a fireplace on in the background. <br /><br />I tried to keep the lighting soft and wwarmk here as to keep things toasty and cosy for you.<br /><br />So get your favourite blanket, some great music in the bakground and settle down for the evening, or perhaps just have this on with no music.<br /><br />If you like my content and feel like you want to show some extra support...<br />Perhaps consider 'buying me a coffee' here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/ambientrenders">https://ko-fi.com/ambientrenders</a><br /><br />This scene is 100% Unreal Engine 4<br /><br />Copyright information:<br />Do not copy, reproduce or redistribute my videos anywhere on the internet, I do not give permission unless its expressly given in writing by myself.
