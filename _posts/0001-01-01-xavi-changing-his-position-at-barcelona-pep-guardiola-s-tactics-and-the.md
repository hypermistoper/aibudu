In what is a truly fascinating feature with one of football’s most intelligent minds, he reveals the influence that coaches, including former Barcelona manager Frank Rijkaard, had on his career-defining change of position – and explains how he had to adapt his own style to become more effective in an area of more creative responsibility.<br /><br />Xavi, who became Barcelona head coach in November 2021, then goes on to discuss the concept of the third-man run, which coaches including Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique have used to such effect at the club. He talks about how the Barcelona teams in which he played employed third-man and even fourth-man runs, and how Lionel Messi in particular was used as a focal point in the team’s attacking play.<br /><br />The Coaches' Voice<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://coachesvoice.com">https://coachesvoice.com</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CoachesVoice">https://twitter.com/CoachesVoice</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/CoachesVoice">https://facebook.com/CoachesVoice</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/CoachesVoice">https://instagram.com/CoachesVoice</a><br /><br />The Coaches' Voice Academy<br /><br />Subscribe today: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://academy.coachesvoice.com/join">https://academy.coachesvoice.com/join</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://academy.coachesvoice.com">https://academy.coachesvoice.com</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/cv_academy">https://twitter.com/cv_academy</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/cv_academy">https://instagram.com/cv_academy</a><br />Join our coaching forum: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/31BuDA3">http://bit.ly/31BuDA3</a><br /><br />#Xavi #FCBarcelona #Masterclass{% endraw %}
