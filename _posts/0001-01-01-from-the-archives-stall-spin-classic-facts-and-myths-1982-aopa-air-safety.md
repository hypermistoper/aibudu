{% raw %}Pulled from the AOPA Air Safety Institute archives, this video places the viewer in the cockpit of a general aviation aircraft during spin entries and recoveries. It covers spin aerodynamics and identifies hazards and inflight situations that can lead to stalls and spins.<br /><br />The video was originally produced as a 16mm film in 1982 and as a video cassette tape during the late 80s.<br /><br />“Imagine, if you will, the plight of a pilot practicing flight at critically slow airspeed who inadvertently stalls the aircraft and enters a fully developed spin. Not having the benefit of previous spin training, the pilot instinctively pulls back on the elevator control in an attempt to raise the nose. Suddenly, the pilot realizes that the elevator control is already back—all the way. Now what does he or she do? What would you do?” (AOPA Air Safety Foundation Flight Instructor’s Safety Report, July 1988){% endraw %}
