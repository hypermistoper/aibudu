{% raw %}Recorded on March 3rd, 2022 <br /><br />Last month, Uncommon Knowledge with Peter Robinson asked Princeton Professor and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Stephen Kotkin 5 questions, all in the foreign policy and history realm. Since then, the world has changed in ways that were unimaginable just 3 weeks ago. So we asked Professor Kotkin to come back for a second round of questions, this time all dedicated to one topic: the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And as usual, his answers are concise, incisive, and analytic. If you want to understand this crisis and some possible outcomes, donâ€™t miss this conversation. <br /><br />For further information: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hoover.org/publications/uncommon-knowledge">https://www.hoover.org/publications/uncommon-knowledge</a><br /><br />Interested in exclusive Uncommon Knowledge content?
