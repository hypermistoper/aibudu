{% raw %}As we get closer to Camp NaNo starting, I thought it might be valuable to talk about what I believe are the FIVE most crucial elements of a great book. As writers, we have so much to learn and so many pieces of storytelling that need to come together, that it can often feel overwhelming. Where do we even start?<br /><br />In my opinion, these five elements of storytelling are the absolute most important to focus on. So, letâ€™s talk about what they are and why theyâ€™re so important in great writing.<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />0:00 Intro<br />0:22 1. The Hook<br />3:40 2. Characters We Care About<br />8:47 3.
