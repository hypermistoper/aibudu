{% raw %}For the life of me, I can't figure out why every gas fireplace doesn't come with a blower?!?  Well, mine didn't but now I have one after buying this fireplace blower kit from fireplaceblowersonline.com.  This video shows me installing it into my Majestic gas fireplace.  This should be a similar installation into other brands of gas fireplaces.  This blower is the GFK4 / GFK21 model fan kit.  Entire job takes about 10 minutes and is not difficult.  <br />Warning: There is live electric in your fireplace.  Install at your own risk.{% endraw %}
