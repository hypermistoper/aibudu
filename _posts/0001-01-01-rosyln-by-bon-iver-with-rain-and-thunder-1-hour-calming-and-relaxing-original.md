{% raw %}THIS IS THE ORIGINAL VIDEO RE-UPLOADED. <br />it was removed due to copyright, but it is now resolved. <br /><br />i like this song. for me, it has a tranquility vibe that i like listening to when its raining or when im sad. but since, it's not raining, what better way is to add rain and thunder song effects to it. the sound of rain and thunder is another way that relaxes me. there's just something about it that makes me feel calm. i have always loved the rain<br /><br />this sound is perfect when you cant sleep, when you are just studying, if you're sad, heartbroken, or just wanna vibe to something calm, and relaxing. know to take a break once in awhile. we're just a very very very tiny creature compared to everything else around us. what we are overthinking may feel like it's very huge, but it won't matter, really.<br /><br />songs like this help me feel better.<br /><br />𝚒𝚝𝚜 𝚘𝚔𝚊𝚢 𝚗𝚘𝚝 𝚝𝚘 𝚋𝚎 𝚘𝚔𝚊𝚢<br /><br />Support the channel, buy me a coffee ☕: Ko-fi.com/chelrish<br /><br />🌻 disclaimer:<br />I do not own any music in this video.<br />© ALL CREDITS GO TO THE RIGHTFUL OWNERS.<br /><br />The purpose of this video is solely for songs compilation.
