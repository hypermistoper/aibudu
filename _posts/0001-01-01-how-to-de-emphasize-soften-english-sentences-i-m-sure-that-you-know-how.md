{% raw %}I'm sure that you know how to emphasize something in English, but have you learned how to de-emphasize a sentence? De-emphasizing is very common in English, and in this English lesson I'll teach you how to do it.<br /><br />You'll hear sentences like, &quot;It is a little bit cold.&quot; or &quot;I can barely hear you.&quot; These are sentences where we want to lessen or soften the meaning and we do that in a very straightforward way.<br /><br />I'm sure you'll learn a few new words and phrases in this free English class that you can use in your next conversation!<br /><br />Have a great day!<br /><br />âŒ› Remember:  Always watch the video three times.  Twice today with English subtitles on, and once tomorrow with the English subtitles off.  This will reinforce the English you have learned!<br /><br />--<br />âœ… This video edited by Ember Productions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://audreyember.com">https://audreyember.com</a> Thanks Audrey!<br />--<br /><br />âœ… Support Me and Get These Members Only Perks:<br />ðŸ˜€ðŸ’² If you would like to become a member of my channel here is the link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJJTxA36ZPNTJ1WFIByaeA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZJJTxA36ZPNTJ1WFIByaeA/join</a><br /><br />Becoming a member at every level has these benefits and perks:<br />1) For 10 minutes during each live stream you will be able to participate in the &quot;Members Only&quot; chat.<br />2) A cool crown beside your name during live streams and when making comments on videos.<br />3) Your name in green during live stream lesson chat.<br />4) You will have access to a members only video each Wednesday called, &quot;Wednesdays with Bob&quot;.
