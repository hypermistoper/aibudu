{% raw %}This is one of the more bizarre cases I have filmed. Actress Brittany Murphy and husband Simon Monjack both died 5 months apart in the same house. The original toxicology report stated they both died from pneumonia but there are other theories and reports stating that there was other causes of death. In this video, I visit both the graves of both brittany and simon.<br /><br />If you have any suggestions for any crime locations, infamous crimes or infamous people you want me to cover, (mostly around WA state as that is where I live but any state is fine) send me a message on facebook or instagram @ infamous crime locations. <br /><br />Thank you for checking out my channel. If you enjoy crime related content and especially seeing me go to where these crimes happen, definitely subscribe and hit the bell to get notified of every new video.
