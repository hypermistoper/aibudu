{% raw %}According to the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC), economic success depends on the quality of local skills, capable public institutions, reliable infrastructure, and proximity to markets and suppliers. <br /><br />The organization says economists and policymakers consistently neglect the role of space and geography. <br /><br />HRSC argues that global evidence shows that place and location are important for productivity, growth and development that is specific to a particular mix of local industries and macro-economic conditions. <br /><br />As the government delivers budget allocations tomorrow, it would be important to examine the backdrop against which the country's economy and budget are planned. <br /><br />HSRC Senior Research Specialist in Inclusive Economic Development Dr Justin Paul Visagie speaks to SABC News. <br /><br />For more news, visit sabcnews.com and also #SABCNews on all Social Media platforms.{% endraw %}
