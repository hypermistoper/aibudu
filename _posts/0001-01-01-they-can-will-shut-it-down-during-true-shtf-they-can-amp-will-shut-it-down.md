{% raw %}They Can &amp; Will Shut It Down During True SHTF<br />You should be prepared for the internet to go dark if things escalate to WW3 levels. The US government has some little known legalities that allows it. <br /><br />Prepping has reaped many benefits from the internet. Some of the greatest have been our ability to network with other preparedness minded individuals who want to work together as a community to survive SHTF when it arrives. However, that could all be shut off at any point in time. And just as a reminder to how fragile that system is, here are some little known legalities that the US government can exploit in order to accomplish this goal during any world war 3 type event:<br />Section 606 of the Communications Act of 1934: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.justice.gov/file/20676/download#:~:text=Section%20606(c)%20of%20the,jurisdiction%20of%20the%20United%20States%2C">https://www.justice.gov/file/20676/download#:~:text=Section%20606(c)%20of%20the,jurisdiction%20of%20the%20United%20States%2C</a><br />NCC Standard Operating Procedure 303: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://epic.org/wp-content/uploads/foia/dhs/internet-kill-switch/25.1-SOP-303-Updated-Release.pdf">https://epic.org/wp-content/uploads/foia/dhs/internet-kill-switch/25.1-SOP-303-Updated-Release.pdf</a><br /><br />M.A.G.I.C Discord Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/TCxUT4kpDn">https://discord.gg/TCxUT4kpDn</a><br /><br />For more information on SHTF prepping, please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.MagicPrepper.com">https://www.MagicPrepper.com</a><br /><br />Invader Coffee is what I'll be drinking in the apocalypse.
