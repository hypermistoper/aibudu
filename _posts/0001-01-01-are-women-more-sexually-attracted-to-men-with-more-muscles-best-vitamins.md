I was tall and skinny. <br /><br />The coach wanted me to play varsity basketball the next year - but, I needed to gain some muscle.<br /><br />So, where am I going with all of this? <br /><br />Well, today‚Äôs topic is about women and if they are more sexually attracted to guys with more muscles? <br /><br />Do they prefer a muscular guy, instead of a skinny guy?<br /><br />Well, multiple types of research have continually shown that yes, women prefer men with more muscles.<br /><br />But, what defines ‚Äúmore muscle‚Äù?<br /><br /><br /><br />NINO: You can use regular human images if you‚Äôd prefer<br /><br />Different studies basically broke things down into 4 body types<br /><br />Skinny<br />Lean<br />Athletic<br />Built<br /><br />So, let me just get to the bottom line and save you time.<br /><br />The ‚Äúskinny‚Äù guy always came in last place, at less than 5% of women preferring this body type.<br /><br />The super ‚Äúbuilt‚Äù guy, who is probably more like a bodybuilder, he came in 3rd place at around 15-20% preference by women.<br /><br />The ‚Äúlean‚Äù guy came in 2nd place, at about 35% preference.<br /><br />And the winner was the ‚Äúathletic‚Äù guy at about 45% preference.<br /><br />So, why did the results come out this way?<br /><br />Well, the surveys said and the researchers discovered that women want to feel feminine. They want to feel protected and safe.<br /><br />Thus, the skinny guy instantly loses. <br /><br />Muscles make a woman feel safe and feminine. As does height.<br /><br />However, being super muscular like a big bodybuilder can be a turn-off. It‚Äôs too much muscle. <br /><br />Women may also think the guy is too self-absorbed or vein.<br /><br />This is why the majority of women prefer the ‚Äúlean‚Äù and/or ‚Äúathletic‚Äù look - with athletic being the clear winner.<br /><br />Either way, being super skinny or fat is not attractive for most people.<br /><br />So, do your best to gain some muscle. <br /><br />Women also prefer more upper body muscles - such as chest, shoulders and arms. But nobody likes chicken legs or a flat ass - so, work your lower body as well.<br /><br />Another very important fact is that the leaner you are, the better and more muscular you look. Nobody is turned off by ripped six-pack abs.<br /><br />So, don‚Äôt ‚Äúbulk‚Äù and get fat either as you‚Äôre trying to gain muscle.<br /><br />Of course, the next question is - great, what‚Äôs the best way to gain muscle and still be lean and have six-pack abs?<br /><br />==============¬≠<br />Thank you for watching.
