{% raw %}Children who experience physical, cognitive or emotional neglect, often face anxiety. As a result, their body produces stress hormones. If this happens a lot, these hormones become toxic for their developing brain, which then later can repress emotional and cognitive well-being for life.<br /><br />Non profit of Daniel Rucareanu: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/federeii/">https://www.facebook.com/federeii/</a><br /><br />TREATMENTS<br />If a child is used to suppressing their emotions, because of neglect, it may be difficult to recognize and experience them in a healthy way. Therapists and mental health professionals can help both children and adults learn to identify, accept, and express their emotions in a healthful manner. These treatment options include:<br />1. Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT): CBT aims to explain to you what's going on inside your brain and how to cope with irrational feelings or fears.<br />2. The Hoffman Process: This 7-8 day's guided process, designed to bring participants back into their childhood to reconnect with their parents and make peace. <br />3. Family therapy: If a child is being emotionally neglected at home, family therapy can help both the parents and the child.<br />4. Parenting classes: Parents who neglect their child‚Äôs emotional needs could benefit from parenting classes.<br />5. Psychoanalysis: The aim of psychoanalysis therapy is to release repressed emotions and experiences, i.e., make the unconscious conscious.<br /><br />SUPPORT us to help raise awareness about neglected children and other important topics<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/sprouts">https://www.patreon.com/sprouts</a>  üê¶:<br /><br />DOWNLOAD video without ads and background music ü§´:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sproutsschools.com/video-lessons/">https://sproutsschools.com/video-lessons/</a><br /><br />SIGN UP to our mailing list and never miss a new video from us üîî:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://eepurl.com/dNU4BQ">http://eepurl.com/dNU4BQ</a> <br /><br />SOURCES and teaching resources üéì:<br />Blog post coming soon!<br /><br />VISIT our website :<br />www.sproutsschools.com<br /><br />CONTRIBUTE by upvoting your favourite topic or suggesting new ones :<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sprouts.featureupvote.com/">https://sprouts.featureupvote.com/</a><br /><br />THANKS to our patrons <br />This video was made with the support of our Patrons: Johan Klassen, Angela, <br />Wolfgang Vullhorst, Reynir √ñrn Bachmann Gu√∞mundsson, Daniel Kapuschinsky, <br />Jonathan Schwarz, Margaret Grace, Bob Wilkerson, Stephen, Mar√≠a, Raymond Fujioka, Hal Beltran, Susan Schuster, Deepak Kamlesh, Margaret Grace, Jonathan Schwarz, Shao Xiang, Denis Kraus, Judy Roland, Bettina Kind, Gatsby Dkdc, Enrique Arellano Farias, Vishruth Harithsa, Nancy Bueffler, Adam G, Tetiana Gerasymova, Raman Srivastava, Daniel Kramer, David Markham, Marq Short, Scripz, Muhammad Humayun, Ginger, Tsungren Yang, Esther Chiang, Badrah, Cedric Wang, Broke, Jeffrey Cassianna, Sergei Kukhariev, Andrea Basilio Rava, kritik bhimani, Don Bone, John Zhang, Mathis Nu and all the others.Thank you!
