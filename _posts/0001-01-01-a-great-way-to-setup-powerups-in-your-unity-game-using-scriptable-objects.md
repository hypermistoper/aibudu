{% raw %}Using Scriptable Objects as a driver for your Powerup system lets you create different types of powerups incredibly quick - but the BEST reason to do it is for separation of concerns amongst your components.<br /><br />Your Scriptable Object powerup can focus on the one thing it does best, applying a powerup to a target, while all the other things like a Powerup Collider can just focus on detecting collision. <br /><br />This is a clean code approach, and by using Delegate Objects you can save yourself from the horrible pain of spaghetti code as your code base gets larger. <br /><br />This Unity Tutorial is a MUST LEARN to powerup (hee hee) your skill<br /><br />âž¤SUBSCRIBE to become the very best game dev, like no one ever was ðŸ’˜<br /><br />~~<br /><br />âž¤Scriptable Object talk by Richard Fine: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vmRwLYWNRo&amp;t=904s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6vmRwLYWNRo&amp;t=904s</a><br /><br />âž¤LIKE the video if you enjoyed, it really helps the channel! <br /><br />âž¤Join our DISCORD SERVER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/pMrMshh">https://discord.gg/pMrMshh</a> <br />We have channels to help you with your problems!<br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />#bmo #unity #tutorial{% endraw %}
