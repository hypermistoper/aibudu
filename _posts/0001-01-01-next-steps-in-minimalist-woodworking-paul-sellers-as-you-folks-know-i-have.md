{% raw %}As you folks know, I have long advocated that you don't need a lot of space or lots of fancy machinery to make things in woodworking. You may have seen me make hundreds of projects using just a relatively small number of hand tools. <br /><br />But, how many tools do you really need? I am taking things to the next level in order to challenge myself to make joints and build furniture in a truly minimalist setting. Do you think I can make furniture with just two simple hand tools? Join me on my journey. <br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />For more free woodworking videos, please consider subscribing to my channel:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PaulSellersWoodwork?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/PaulSellersWoodwork?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Want to learn more about woodworking?<br /><br />Go to Woodworking Masterclasses for weekly project episodes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2JeH3a9">http://bit.ly/2JeH3a9</a><br /><br />Go to Common Woodworking for step-by-step beginner guides and courses: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/35VQV2o">http://bit.ly/35VQV2o</a><br /> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2BXmuei">http://bit.ly/2BXmuei</a> for Paulâ€™s latest ventures on his blog <br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2oWpy7W">http://bit.ly/2oWpy7W</a><br /><br />Facebook- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2JgKHQS">http://bit.ly/2JgKHQS</a><br /><br />Twitter- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/33S7RFa">http://bit.ly/33S7RFa</a><br /><br />Pinterest- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/35X5uTf">http://bit.ly/35X5uTf</a>{% endraw %}
