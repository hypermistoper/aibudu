{% raw %}Our God is Lord over all, and this is why we bow today. Tomorrow. Forever. Brothers and sisters, let us raise a sound in praise to the Lord our King for we are the generation of those who seek Him diligently!<br /><br />“Lift up your heads, you gates; be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.”<br />Psalm 24:7-8{% endraw %}
