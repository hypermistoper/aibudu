{% raw %}After a month in quarantine, we are finally out and headed to Dipolog City where Slater’s family is from. It was so nice to finally see the setting of most of his childhood stories and memories. Our first stop was Villa Angelina Luxury Suites in Dakak, which is a beach resort in Dapitan City. We got to spend some time in the beach to look for hermit crabs (Scott’s favorite) and ride a kayak (Scott’s other favorite!). His favorite moment though was surely the bubble bath we took from the balcony of our cliffside room. It was so fun splashing around with him and having a view of the sea right beside us. The Villa we got was stunning, and definitely a great way to start our trip. They even lent us a golf cart to drive around by ourselves! Special thanks to Rhio of Villa Angelina for making our stay super memorable and comfortable. ❤️<br /><br />If you guys ever find yourselves in Dapitan, I highly recommend a visit to this resort!<br />---<br />Music from EPIDEMIC SOUND: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/38jRSq">http://share.epidemicsound.com/38jRSq</a><br />(free 30 day trial with link above!)<br /><br />Follow ME:<br />www.kryzuy.com<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/kryzzzie">http://instagram.com/kryzzzie</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/kryzzzie">http://twitter.com/kryzzzie</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/kryzzzie">http://facebook.com/kryzzzie</a>{% endraw %}
