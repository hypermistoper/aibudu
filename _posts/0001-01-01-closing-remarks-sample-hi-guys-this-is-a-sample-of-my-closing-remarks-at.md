{% raw %}Hi guys, this is a sample of my closing remarks at my school's webinar. Below in the description are my whole speech/subtitle, please don't forget to subscribe and share my video :)<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Closing Remarks:<br /><br />It's been a pleasure being with all of you today, thank you <br /><br />I observed the excellent presentations and active discussions among our speakers namely Mr. Cabrera, Mr. Solon, Mr, Rodriguez and Ms. Labitan., therefore I can conclude that the purpose of the webinar has been completely accomplished.<br /><br />As mentioned earlier, service should be the means and ends toward the betterment of the society. This was further strengthen by Mahatma Gandhi and I quote: “The best way to find yourself is to lose yourself in the service of others”. Also I would like to use this opportunity to thank our medical frontliners who are risking their lives for the benefit and service of the Filipino people. <br /><br />I hope that what you have learned through the webinar will help you a lot in many aspects of life especially in your service to our fellowmen. <br /><br />Finally, on behalf of EAC 1st year law students, I would like to express my appreciation to all the participants, speakers, staffs, committee, and of course, to our dear professor: Dean Chua for taking time out of your busy schedule to attend the webinar. <br /><br />I would like to close my remarks and officially announce the end of the webinar session, wishing you all the prosperity amid the pandemic. With that, thank you for your attention. Stay safe!{% endraw %}
