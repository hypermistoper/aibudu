What about your lungs ? or your brain?<br /><br />No, they are not nearly the body’s largest organ?<br /><br />You can see your body’s largest organ right now?<br /><br />What are we talking about?<br /><br />The skin of course!!<br /><br />The skin is the largest organ of the body, accounting for about 15% of the total adult body weight.<br /><br />It performs many vital functions, including protection against external physical, chemical, and biological assailants, as well as prevention of excess water loss from the body and a role in thermoregulation.<br /><br />The skin is continuous, with the mucous membranes lining the body’s surface.<br /><br />The integumentary system is formed by the skin and its derivative structures.<br /><br />The skin has basically three layers - Epidermis, dermis and hypodermis.<br /><br />The epidermis is the outermost layer of skin which provides a waterproof barrier and creates our skin tone.<br /><br />The epidermis consists of a specific group of cells known as keratinocytes which function to synthesize, keratin which is a long thread-like protein with a protective role.<br /><br />The dermis is beneath the epidermis and it contains tough connective tissue, hair follicles, and sweat glands.<br /><br />The dermis is fundamentally made up of the fibrillar a structural protein is known as collagen.<br /><br />The dermis lies on subcutaneous tissue or panniculus, which contain small lobe of fat cells known as lipocyte.<br /><br />The deeper subcutaneous tissue or hypodermis is made of fat and connective tissue.<br /><br />The color of the skin is created by special cells called melanocytes, which produce the pigment melanin.<br /><br />Melanocytes are located in the epidermis.<br /><br />Thanks for watching this video. <br /><br />Download Extraclass.com app: - Play Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/extraclassapp">http://bit.ly/extraclassapp</a><br /><br />Follow us on our social media handles to stay updated.<br /><br />Website – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.extraclass.com/">https://www.extraclass.com/</a><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/extraclassofficial">https://www.facebook.com/extraclassofficial</a><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/extraclassofficial">https://www.instagram.com/extraclassofficial</a><br />Youtube - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/extraclass">https://www.youtube.com/extraclass</a><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/extraclass_com">https://twitter.com/extraclass_com</a><br />Happy Learning!!<br />“Thanks for watching”.<br />#Extraclass<br />#skin<br />#biology<br />#zoology<br />#class11<br />#cbse<br />#class12{% endraw %}
