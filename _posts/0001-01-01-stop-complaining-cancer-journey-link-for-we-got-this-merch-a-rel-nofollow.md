{% raw %}LINK FOR ‘WE GOT THIS’ MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bonfire.com/we-got-this-24/">https://www.bonfire.com/we-got-this-24/</a><br />Some of you have asked me to make merch and I have not really thought much of it but now getting my own t-shirts/hoodies/sweatshirts with my message on it feels incredible. If you want to get something from this limited collection, link is <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bonfire.com/we-got-this-24/">https://www.bonfire.com/we-got-this-24/</a> <br />I am always saying WE GOT THIS in real life and online. We all have our own struggles and I believe we can get through anything together. When I was diagnosed with cancer in September, I thought this was my own struggle but I realised my cancer has affected everyone around me. I am a daughter, a girlfriend, a sister, a friend, a cousin, a grand daughter &amp; more. I know my journey has affected everyone around me and I know now more than ever that I have no choice but to get better. Whatever life throws at us, we are going to get through it together.
