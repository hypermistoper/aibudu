{% raw %}Comparing the food environment of the U.S. to Japan's.<br />▲Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/WILearned">https://www.patreon.com/WILearned</a><br />▲Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/jeverettlearned">https://twitter.com/jeverettlearned</a><br />▲IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jeverett.whativelearned/">https://www.instagram.com/jeverett.whativelearned/</a><br /><br />This video highlights the difference between the food environment of America and Japan. America's obesity rate is about 30% (biggest state is 37.7%, smallest 22.3%) whereas Japan's obesity rate is 3.5%<br />While there's other countries on each side of the obesity spectrum, I chose to compare these two because I grew up in America and spent the last 7 years here in Japan. The places that I describe as &quot;reasonably healthy&quot; in Japan aren't necessarily places I recommend as &quot;optimally healthy&quot; - I'm simply point out that while convenient food in America ranges from very unhealthy to unhealthy, convenient food in Japan ranges from very unhealthy to pretty healthy. <br /><br />Big thanks to Itchban for letting me use his footage (6:30 - 6:48):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/itchban">http://www.youtube.com/itchban</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/itchban">http://www.instagram.com/itchban</a> <br /><br />Featured Music:<br />Broke for Free - As Colorful as ever<br />Graphiqs Groove - Deep Sky Blue<br /><br />For Business inquiries: <br />joseph.everett.wil@gmail.com{% endraw %}
