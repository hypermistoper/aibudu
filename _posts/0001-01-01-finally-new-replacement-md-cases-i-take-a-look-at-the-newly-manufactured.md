I'll show the first version of a video on Patreon and often the feedback I get results in a video going through further revisions to improve it.  e.g. Fix audio issues, clarify points, add extra footage or cut extraneous things out. The video that goes live on youtube is the final version. If you want to see the videos early too, you can sign up to Patreon here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/techmoan">https://www.patreon.com/techmoan</a>{% endraw %}
