{% raw %}In this video we show step by step how to make a tool holder (tool support) for our Line Boring bar! This tool holder is for our 40mm boring bar we run on our Sir Meccanica WS2 portable line boring machine, we already have a smaller shop made holder but need to make a bigger one for all our larger line boring jobs. To make this tool holder we are using a piece of 170mm diameter 1045 steel. We start with turning the OD and boring the ID on the lathe before setting up in the milling machine for drilling and reaming all the holes. We also use our 150T hydraulic press for broaching a square before drilling and fitting the hinge to complete the tool holder.<br /><br />In this video we are using: <br />- Hafco TM-1740G Lathe <br />- BM-63VE Milling machine<br />- Hafco HMT-150 Hydraulic Press<br /><br />Join our channel:<br />We upload new videos every Friday at 5pm AEST!
