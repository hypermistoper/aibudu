In this clever arrangement for band, Paul Murtha uses a peppy 2-beat style and starts out with the trombones on the melody. Every section of the band gets into the act, however, including a solo or soli for tuba, and a brief slower section for a Dixieland combo leading to the rousing finish. A guaranteed highlight on any concert.<br />HL04004779<br />HL04004780{% endraw %}
