{% raw %}Moment of truth! Can the Marble Machine X Play tight music in its current design configuration or not? <br /><br />This ended up on the long format side, so many things that I really wanted to explain and show clearly. I am seeing a lot of questions that tells me that not everyone is on board with some of the most basic concepts of the MMX. So, I was in kind of explanation mode for the whole video! Synching the marble drop will be done with an adjustable screw that locates the first programming plate of 4 (we have skipped the 8 plate design and using 4 instead, twice as big). I didn't have time to explain this part but its an essential function to synch the crankshaft precisely to the beat of the music.<br /><br />Also my PMMA bends here were really lacking patience :) for all you eagle eyed out there :) Patience is a virtue when it comes to clean PMMA bends. I was operating under the &quot;donut spend too much time on prototypes&quot; principle. That also explains the packing tape!<br /><br />Enjoy and have a great day everyone!
