{% raw %}El Chapo's Wifes Extravagant Lifestyle | Luxury Lifestyle | The Drop<br />When Emma Coronel Aispuro watched her husband, the dreaded drug kingpin Joaquin El Chapo Guzman being sentenced to life imprisonment by a Brooklyn federal court, she looked unfazed. The former Mexican beauty queen was just 29, and 32 years younger than her 61-year-old husband. Although Aispuro was married to the world’s most notorious drug boss, she lived mostly in obscurity, but as soon as El Chapo went to jail, it turns out Aispuro lived quite a lavish lifestyle and did not stop her luxurious spending until her own arrest in 2021. Aispuro was arrested in Dulles International airport on charges of helping her husband in his illegal activities and even assisting his escape.
