{% raw %}Fans have been keeping up with the Duggars ever since 19 kids and counting. But ever since son Josh Duggar found himself in legal trouble, the big concern on everyone’s mind is how will his wife Anna fare on her own? Josh is set to be sentenced sometime in April and the reality star faces decades in prison. With Josh in jail and 7 kids to raise, Anna is thrust into life as a single mom. Money has become a huge issue, Homeland Security raided the family’s used car lot and the couple sold their dream home in Arkansas way below asking price to pay for legal expenses.  Out of the 3 dozen Duggar family members, not many have come to her aid, even now as she resides in a warehouse on Jim Bob and Michelle’s property. The majority of her family, including her parents, lives in Florida, so it might make sense for her to stick close to the Duggars. But Anna has stayed away from social media possibly to avoid negative comments. So, it is unclear whether Anna plans to stay on the Duggar property, or move away and get a job to support the kids. Anna recently broke her silence and resurfaced on Instagram and Twitter to say there is “more to the story” and posted a link to his appeal filing. This leaves even more unanswered questions as to whether Anna will file for divorce, or stick to her strong Christian morals and stand by her husband.<br /><br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/hHvOf8">https://goo.gl/hHvOf8</a><br /><br />CHAPTERS<br />0:00 INTRO<br />0:14 Adjusting to life as a single mom<br />0:53 How many kids do Anna and Josh have together?<br />1:42 Out of the 3 dozen Duggars, do any come to help Anna? <br />2:30 Where is Anna’s family?<br />3:18 Is divorce on the horizon?<br />4:24 How Anna will support the family?<br />5:07 What is their net worth?<br />5:50 Home Sweet Home, where Anna and the fam are living now<br />6:30 Return to the Gram<br />7:24 What’s next for Anna?<br />8:03 END<br /><br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/">https://www.facebook.com/TheThingscom/</a><br /><br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thethings.com">https://www.thethings.com</a><br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: legal@valnetinc.com{% endraw %}
