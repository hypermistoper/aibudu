{% raw %}Russian soldiers, who came to Ukraine from the territory of Belarus, confess that participated in the military drills since summer 2021. They were constantly brainwashed that Ukraine was seized by ‘Nazi junta’ and needs ‘liberation.’ They believed, this time, they were participating some ordinary military exercises. <br />Banality of Evil! <br />Were they ready to kill the civilians? Did they know everything in advance? Why didn’t they disobey their commanders?{% endraw %}
