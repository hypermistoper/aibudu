There's many great choruses that only have a chord progression–and a catchy hook.<br /> <br />Everything else comes from dynamics, layering, and repetition.<br /><br />I’ll be taking a chorus that I received from a connection of mine on LANDR Network. <br /><br />She mentioned that she needed help writing the chorus and has the verse and pre-chorus already written.<br /><br />I’ll be importing the session she sent me into Logic and I’m going to attempt to write a chorus for her using different instruments, layering, and some vocal melody ideas.<br /><br />------------------<br /><br />Try LANDR now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2WppOwI">https://bit.ly/2WppOwI</a><br />Subscribe to LANDR on YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2BcY9US">https://bit.ly/2BcY9US</a><br />Follow the LANDR blog to get the best tips, tools and tutorials for producers: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://blog.landr.com/">https://blog.landr.com/</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/landrmusic/">https://www.instagram.com/landrmusic/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/LANDR_music">https://twitter.com/LANDR_music</a><br /><br />--------------------<br />#songwriting<br />#songhooks<br />#musicproduction<br />#LANDRNetwork<br />#songwriter<br />#collaboration{% endraw %}
