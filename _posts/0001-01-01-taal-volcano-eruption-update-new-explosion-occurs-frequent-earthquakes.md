{% raw %}The Taal Volcano started a new eruption on January 29th, 2022. After a several day pause in activity, another explosion occurred on February 2nd. These 10 separate explosions each ejected small amounts of lava, but primarily involved water vapor. It appears that this week's eruption is more than halfway over, but this is not a certainty as a much larger series of explosions could occur. As a result, warning about residents staying away from the Taal Lake for extended periods of time have been issued. This video will cover what might happen next and state the series of events which led to this explosive eruption.<br /><br />Social media link(s) of a scientific organization which can provide more up to date information:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/">https://www.phivolcs.dost.gov.ph/</a><br /><br />If you would like to support this channel, consider becoming a patron at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/geologyhub.">http://patreon.com/geologyhub.</a><br /><br />Another way to support this channel is to make an order via our gemstone and geology related etsy store at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.">http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.</a><br /><br />This channel's merch store is also on etsy at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://geologyhub.etsy.com.">http://geologyhub.etsy.com.</a><br /><br />Graphics of eruption dates are courtesy of the Global Volcanism Program, Smithsonian Institute. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://volcano.si.edu/">https://volcano.si.edu/</a><br /><br />0:00 Taal Erupts  <br />0:19 Cause of the Eruptions <br />0:52 A Pattern in Taal's Eruptions<br />1:45 Current Stage of Eruption<br />2:35 Sulfur Dioxide Emissions<br />3:14 Current Alert Level{% endraw %}
