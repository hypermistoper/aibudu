{% raw %}A follow up of my takeaway from the first official Starship Update in 2 years. The last time they did one of these the vehicle on display was Starship Mk1 which exploded in a pressure, but since then SpaceX has progressed to exploding prototypes during  fueling tests, exploding prototypes during flight tests, and hoping to not explode a booster during an orbital test.<br /><br />So now we have a full Starship stack on display and the most important updates in my mind are the Raptor 2 progress and the clarification of the role of Boca Chica vs Florida vs Sea Platforms for the long term program.<br /><br />Watch the full update here, prepare for dad jokes.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N7L8Xhkzqo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3N7L8Xhkzqo</a><br /><br />Follow me on Twitter for more updates:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DJSnM">https://twitter.com/DJSnM</a><br /><br />I have a discord server where I regularly turn up:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/zStmKbM">https://discord.gg/zStmKbM</a><br /><br />If you really like what I do you can support me directly through Patreon<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/scottmanley">https://www.patreon.com/scottmanley</a>{% endraw %}
