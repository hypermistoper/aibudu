{% raw %}Gulf Arab States declare they will not sanction Russia<br /><br />The Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries will not join the West in imposing sanctions on Russia over the Ukraine war, Russian Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, said yesterday.<br /><br />&quot;Aspects of the international situation, which are connected with the events unfolded by the West around Ukraine, are well understood by our partners from the Gulf Cooperation Council States,&quot; Lavrov told reporters in Saudi Arabia's capital city, Riyadh. His visit included meetings with GCC Foreign Ministers.<br /><br />The Russian Foreign Ministry recently said in a statement that Lavrov and his Emirati counterpart, Abdullah bin Zayed Al-Nahyan, had discussed &quot;close cooperation on stabilising oil global prices&quot;.<br /><br />On grain exports, Lavrov accused the Ukrainian government of &quot;blocking the way for its grain to get exports abroad&quot;.  &quot;Our offer to our Western partners is clear, which includes providing corridors for ships transporting grain, after clearing mines, and the Turkish side has offered to help clear mines,&quot; he said.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20220602-gulf-countries-will-not-impose-sanctions-on-russia-says-russian-fm/">https://www.middleeastmonitor.com/20220602-gulf-countries-will-not-impose-sanctions-on-russia-says-russian-fm/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.arabnews.com/node/2094546/saudi-arabia">https://www.arabnews.com/node/2094546/saudi-arabia</a>{% endraw %}
