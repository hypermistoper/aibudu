{% raw %}This 2004 Arctic Cat 650 4 Wheeler was only $1,000 but it lived a rough life. Josh bought this bike a few weeks ago and it started right up. Once the new frame came in and everything was swapped into it the starter clicked a few times and everything went dead. Josh called me into to find the electrical problem while he finished bolting everything else back together. After about 45 minutes of tracing the entire ignition system out I found the problem and it was way simpler than either of us expected. If you want to watch the entire frame swap and what Josh is going to use it for the video will be on his channel soon. @The Fractured Rooster Garage <br /><br />MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shopWatchJRGo.com">http://shopWatchJRGo.com</a><br />Shop Motul: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://motul.com">http://motul.com</a><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Common Questions:<br /><br />What motorcycle do I ride?
