{% raw %}Hello. In this video we consider a turbofan engine on a commercial aircraft. These engines are started through a set of switches in the cockpit. The start sequence of the engine, gets initiated when the air from a high pressure air source enters the starter unit in the accessory gear box. <br />In this video we see and understand what is start sequence by looking at the different components on the engine and how each component contributes to the engine start.<br /><br />hope you enjoy. thank you. <br />Please Watch and Subscribe for more videos!{% endraw %}
