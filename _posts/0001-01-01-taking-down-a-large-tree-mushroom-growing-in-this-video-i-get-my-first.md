{% raw %}In this video, I get my first delivery of compost delivered for the season and start planting some seeds. We called in the experts to help us cut down a large tree, and I begin to inoculate my logs for mushroom growing.   <br /><br />::: JACKERY  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/3cxhf">https://shrsl.com/3cxhf</a><br />::: BAREBONES TOOLS  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://alnk.to/aLDcMIe">https://alnk.to/aLDcMIe</a><br />::: BOOTSTRAP FARMER  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shrsl.com/3c0sq">http://shrsl.com/3c0sq</a><br />::: PATREON   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/nakedgardener">https://www.patreon.com/nakedgardener</a><br />::: MEDICINAL HERBAL TEA BLENDS  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thenakedgardener.us/store">https://www.thenakedgardener.us/store</a> <br /><br />Sharing my story about moving from the desert in Arizona to a secluded part of land in the Midwest to build a permaculture garden and thriving homestead. <br /><br />Aside from a few raised garden beds in the past, I have never done anything like this before on this scale. I'm learning as I go along, but am sharing my love and enthusiasm for reconnecting with nature, growing my own food, and living more sustainably. <br /><br />I believe that our connection to nature is vital for our health, and for the health of the planet. We must come back to the earth to sustain life and live more vibrantly, as nature intended. This is not just a way of living, but a way of life. <br /><br />I garden the NAKED way. I don't use any herbicides, pesticides, or chemicals, and that carries through in every other aspect of my life as well - from the type of products I use, the food I eat, and the environment I keep. I also soak up the sun and let the earth touch my skin as often as possible ;) <br /><br />Thank you for watching!
