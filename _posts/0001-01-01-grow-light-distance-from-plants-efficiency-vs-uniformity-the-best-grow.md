{% raw %}The best grow light distance from plants is a compromise between:<br />Hanging the grow light as close to the plant canopy as possible to maximise the amount of light reaching the plant (most efficient grow light setup)<br />&amp;<br />Hanging the grow light high enough to distribute the light evenly across the plant canopy (for best uniformity)<br /><br />I use PAR charts generated by @LED Gardener on his PPFD test website, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ppfdcharts.com/">https://ppfdcharts.com/</a><br />For the following grow lights:<br />Viparspectra XS1500 in a 2x2 or 60cm x 60cm grow area<br />MIGRO ARAY 4 PRO in a 4x2 or 120cm x 60cm grow area<br />Spider Farmer SF7000 in a 4 x 4 or 1.2m x 1.2m grow area<br />HLG 600Rspec in a 5 x 5 or 1.5m x 1.5m grow area<br /><br />In each test I look for the maximum PAR to be in the range of 1,000 to 1,100 µmols/m²/second and the lowest PAR reading, usually in the corners, to be no less than 60%of the maximum, ideally 80% for the best uniformity.<br /><br />#ledgrowlight<br />#migrolight<br />#growlightdistance<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.migrolight.com/">https://www.migrolight.com/</a><br /><br />​Follow us:<br />Instagram:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/migrolight/">https://www.instagram.com/migrolight/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MIGROLIGHT/">https://www.facebook.com/MIGROLIGHT/</a>{% endraw %}
