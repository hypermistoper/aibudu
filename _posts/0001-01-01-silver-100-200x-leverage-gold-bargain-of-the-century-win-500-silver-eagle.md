Being in Asia, he likely knows that China has bought up many once more readily available commodity inventory levels.<br /><br />In this 6-minute interview, I subtitled for you. Juerg also drops a hardly known bombshell for viewers live on Bloomberg Asia. Mentioning how outsized silver futures and options leverage in the hundreds of paper ounces versus one-ounce physical supplied to the global market maintains the illusion that all is calm in the #Silver market. It's not, and he describes in further detail about silver supply-side pressures building at the moment.<br /><br />According to Kiener, gold #Bullion at these spot price levels is also the bargain of the Century. Have perhaps a few viewings as to why the metals markets are his primary concern.<br /><br />Kiener is also on record, stating that $5-figure gold price stabilization will be needed in a new currency realignment to help stabilize the world economy. In this week's show notes, you can find backlinks to those points.<br /><br />Juerg Kiener: Metal With Lowest Risk is Gold (Bloomberg Asia, 4/22/2022)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2022-04-22/kiener-metal-with-lowest-risk-is-gold-video">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2022-04-22/kiener-metal-with-lowest-risk-is-gold-video</a><br /><br />Juerg Kiener: 5-Figure Gold in a New Currency Realignment to Stabilize the World Economy (9/15/2011) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/kdD4dzkjXGw?t=300">https://youtu.be/kdD4dzkjXGw?t=300</a><br /><br />Silver and gold spot price markets were hammered downwards in this week's trading action.<br /><br />The spot silver market closed just above $24 oz, with gold finishing just above $1930 oz.<br /><br />The gold-silver ratio has climbed back to 80.<br /><br />The platinum spot price market also sold off strongly today. Finishing near current technical support levels ($930 oz).<br /><br />So we apparently have a good weekend to be bullion buying at heavy discounts versus somewhat recent spot price levels.<br /><br />Thus far in 2022, the US bond market has had its worse performance to begin a year, even worse than 1980, back when price inflation was as bad as it is in real terms today.<br /><br />The borrowing costs for 30 yr fixed-rate mortgages in the United States have risen extremely fast since the start of the year to over 5% levels. The fastest 30 yr mortgage rates have climbed since the late 1980s. The last time we had house buying borrowing costs this high, the median or the middle US housing price was more than half priced where home prices are now, back in the early 2010s.<br /><br />For a longer-term perspective on true value, it currently costs about 187 oz of gold bullion equivalent for a median-priced US home. Back in 2011, that number dipped below 100 ounces. And in 1980, when price inflation was about as high as it is now, the median price of US homes fell below 80 oz of gold bullion equivalent for most of that year. In today's fiat US dollars, that would be near a gold price near $5,000 per troy ounce per median-priced home ($375k).<br /><br />In yet another sign of the changing currency regime times, the nation of Israel announced that it will be adding 4 new fiat currencies to its FX holdings in 2022. The recently sharply devaluing fiat Japanese yen, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, and fiat Chinese yuan renminbi to its basket of FX reserves moving forward. The targeted allocations shrink the amounts of fiat euros, and fiat Federal Reserve notes the Bank of Israel will hold.<br /><br />This week, the Silver Institute, an industry data tracker, made headlines with its latest 2021 silver market data. Citing a silver market deficit of over 51 million ounces last year, not seen since 2015, and the silver market's most significant shortage since 2010.<br /><br />Global Silver Demand Surged in 2021 | Yahoo Finance 4/20/2022<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-silver-demand-surged-2021-123000816.html">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-silver-demand-surged-2021-123000816.html</a><br /><br />Given how much record gold bullion coin buying is still happening in Australia or the USA, we are still apparently nowhere near the moment when the gold price gets so exorbitantly expensive that buyers switch their preference to silver, which often comes near silver price peaks.<br /><br />It will require an acutely higher silver spot price in the future to get this market to a sustainable equilibrium where demand and supply find fair value. Priced still below half its all-time price high, silver still seems perhaps the most prudent long-term buy and hold at these current spot price levels in the precious metals and greater commodity complex.<br /><br />That is all for this week's #SDBullion Market Update.<br /><br />As always to you out there, take great care of yourselves and those you love.{% endraw %}
