{% raw %}Join in with the Restored crew as they attempt to revive this abandoned 1968 SAAB 96. After finding this ol' girl in the woods, resting for over 40 years, the guys take a peek under the hood for the first time only to discover what no one wants to see! Being the first SAAB, they've had around the shop, they discover the remains of a factory V4 engine. Follow along as they dig through one of the largest rats' nests they've had to tackle as well as one of the hardest struggles to get this thing back to life. Will the team be able to get this forgotten relic to breathe again, or was there a good reason it was abandoned years ago? Will it run after 40 years?<br /><br />►►SUBSCRIBE HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa422iqMhGLDX6GVC1gxxlA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCa422iqMhGLDX6GVC1gxxlA?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />►►Interested in becoming a Restored YouTube Member? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/32oydR8">https://bit.ly/32oydR8</a><br />►Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.be-restored.com">https://www.be-restored.com</a><br />►►Interested In Donating To The Restored Crew? : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3eRTDuN">https://bit.ly/3eRTDuN</a><br /><br />►►Any business enquires can be sent to: kravenedkustoms@live.com<br /><br />** Like To Send Us Mail?<br />Lance &amp; Wyatt Bush<br />P.O Box 865, Bogata Tx, 75417<br /><br />#international #abandoned #restored{% endraw %}
