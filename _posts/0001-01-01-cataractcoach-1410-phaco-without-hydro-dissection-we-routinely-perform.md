{% raw %}We routinely perform hydro-dissection during cataract surgery in order to help free the nucleus from the capsular bag. One of the winners from our resident video competition made his entire video about this one specific step of surgery. We can also perform cortical cleaving hydro-dissection to separate the cortex from the capsular bag. But there are some cases where we want to avoid hydro-dissection such as posterior polar cataracts and cases of iatrogenic capsular bag damage from intra-vitreal injections. In this video our guest surgeon shows us his effective technique for cataract surgery without hydro-dissection or even hydro-delineation. I am sure that this will be a useful technique for a challenging case in your future.{% endraw %}
