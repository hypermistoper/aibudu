{% raw %}ΑΠΟ ΤΟΝ ΔΙΣΚΟ &quot;DAY AFTER DAY&quot; 2001<br />μουσική: Μιχάλη Καρρά<br /><br />Sitting in the park along and dreaming<br />Living in the past and thinking<br />Lonely days that I've been waiting just for you<br />Rainy day comes and I am feeling<br />I don't feel like leaving<br />Lonely days and I'm still waiting just for you<br /><br />Stay, cause I need you to help me to end my day<br />Stay, cause I need you to help me to find my way<br />Stay, in the middle of the night I am so afraid<br />Stay and help to make the time go<br /><br />Sunny day but I can't see it<br />Happiness but I can't feel it<br />Things I lost when I was waiting just for you<br />Faces like the comets come and go<br />But I don't want to know<br />Days and nights when I was waiting just for you<br /><br />Stay, cause I need you to help me to end my day<br />Stay, cause I need you to help me to fight my way<br />Stay, in the middle of the night I am so afraid<br />Stay and help to make the time go{% endraw %}
