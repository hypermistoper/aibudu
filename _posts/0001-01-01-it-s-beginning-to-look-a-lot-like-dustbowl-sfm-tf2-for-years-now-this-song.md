{% raw %}For years now this song has been a little personal tradition of mine, so I thought it was finally time that I animated this classic with my own spin to it! <br /><br />Heavily inspired by Ann D-Vine, who made the original Gmod and SFM versions of this wonderful song by the Deadworkers, links below in that order:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y009oQEa8d8&amp;ab_channel=AnnD-Vine">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y009oQEa8d8&amp;ab_channel=AnnD-Vine</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUOjkAqxECc&amp;ab_channel=AnnD-Vine">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUOjkAqxECc&amp;ab_channel=AnnD-Vine</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_YQ9aQRV_c&amp;ab_channel=DeadWorkersParty-Topic">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_YQ9aQRV_c&amp;ab_channel=DeadWorkersParty-Topic</a><br /><br />#tf2 #dustbowl #smissmas #song #sfm #animation #christmas{% endraw %}
