{% raw %}Things to do in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia ‚Äì I became a tour guide (kind of)<br />What $175 can get you in Kuala Lumpur ‚û° <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ftdxn_7Ah5U">https://youtu.be/ftdxn_7Ah5U</a><br /><br />Let‚Äôs spend a tourist day in Kuala Lumpur! Today, I am becoming a tourist guide in Kuala Lumpur Malaysia‚Ä¶well, kind of. I planed a schedule to take Jesslyn around several attractions in the city. Although she is a local here, she has never been to these places in Kuala Lumpur before. If you are looking for things to do in Kuala Lumpur, this might be a cool schedule for you too. <br /><br />Locations of the video<br />Smith Caf√© <br />‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/UDe3bBc2btaL8bdN9">https://goo.gl/maps/UDe3bBc2btaL8bdN9</a><br />Kuala Lumpur Eco Park<br />‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/pn2NMRUgqjefP9eg8">https://goo.gl/maps/pn2NMRUgqjefP9eg8</a><br />Upside Down House<br />‚û°Ô∏è<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://g.page/klupsidedown?share">https://g.page/klupsidedown?share</a><br />Mininature Malaysia<br />‚û°Ô∏è<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://g.page/MinNatureMalaysia?share">https://g.page/MinNatureMalaysia?share</a><br />Tapak Street Dining <br />‚û°Ô∏è<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/9BBwkgnw21EmW1oQ6">https://goo.gl/maps/9BBwkgnw21EmW1oQ6</a><br /><br />#malaysia #travelmalaysia #kualalumpur<br />---------------------------------------- <br />üôãüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èA B O U T M E <br />I am Ken Abroad, a full-time traveler traveling southeast Asia, currently in Malaysia, making Malaysia travel vlogs. It is my goal here on this channel to visit every country in southeast Asia and bring you along the journey. <br />You won‚Äôt see much tourist places in my videos, I rather like to show the ‚Äúreal‚Äù sides of each country in my videos. Where do the local people go to eat? Where do they hang out? How do the locals travel through the country? Stuff like that. <br />There will be almost daily uploads on this channel, during the next months from Southeast Asia. I will be traveling Southeast Asia, showing you around local places and try lots of different local food. Join the journey if you are interested in experiencing Malaysia now from a more authentic local point of view.  <br />Click here to subscribe and follow my trip around southeast Asia <br />‚û°Ô∏è<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2A2GheP">https://bit.ly/2A2GheP</a><br />---------------------------------------- <br />üì∑ I N S T A G R A M <br />Check also my Instagram, where I post pictures regularly, daily stories &amp; lots of behind-the-scenes stuff: @Ken__abroad <br />‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ken__abroad/">https://www.instagram.com/ken__abroad/</a><br />---------------------------------------- <br />üìó M Y T R A V E L G U I D E  E-B O O K<br />I wrote a Thailand travel guide E-book with over 100 pages full with travel tips and recommended places all around Thailand.
