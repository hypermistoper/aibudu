The employment of UAVs has progressed from counter-terrorism and counter-insurgency operations to full-scale conventional war.<br /><br />Both Russia and Ukraine are utilizing drones not only for reconnaissance but also for attack.<br /><br />In this video Defense Updates analyzes how Phoenix Ghost could enable Ukraine to launch asymmetric attacks on Russian forces ?<br /><br />#DefenseUpdates #PhoenixGhost #UkraineRussia<br /><br />CHANNEL LINK:<br /><br /><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/DefenseUpdates">https://www.facebook.com/DefenseUpdates</a><br /><br /><br />SUPPORT US:<br />Patron: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/defenseupdates">https://www.patreon.com/defenseupdates</a><br /><br />AUDIO:<br />scottleffler.com<br /><br />BACKGROUND MUSIC<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/music.html">https://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/music.html</a><br />&quot;Giant Wyrm&quot; Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)<br /><br />Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a><br /><br />IMAGES USES<br /><br />eurasiantimes.com / Aerovironment<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://eurasiantimes.com/repeating-afghan-success-new-surprise-weapon-dislodge-russia/">https://eurasiantimes.com/repeating-afghan-success-new-surprise-weapon-dislodge-russia/</a><br /><br />www.flightglobal.com / USAF <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.flightglobal.com/civil-uavs/usaf-plans-to-end-mq-1-predator-operations-in-2018/117943.article">https://www.flightglobal.com/civil-uavs/usaf-plans-to-end-mq-1-predator-operations-in-2018/117943.article</a><br /><br />aevex.com<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aevex.com/">https://aevex.com/</a><br /><br />www.czdefence.com / AeroVironment / CC BY-NC-ND<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.czdefence.com/article/loitering-munition-in-acr">https://www.czdefence.com/article/loitering-munition-in-acr</a><br /><br />www.latimes.com / Andrew Harnik / Associated Press<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2022-02-11/guests-on-sunday-talk-shows-john-kirby-on-fox-news-sunday-and-the-sunday-show">https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/tv/story/2022-02-11/guests-on-sunday-talk-shows-john-kirby-on-fox-news-sunday-and-the-sunday-show</a><br /><br />19fortyfive.com / Aerovironment<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/04/phoenix-ghost-drone-could-be-a-major-problem-for-russia-in-ukraine/">https://www.19fortyfive.com/2022/04/phoenix-ghost-drone-could-be-a-major-problem-for-russia-in-ukraine/</a><br /><br />alxpin/E+ via Getty Images / seekingalpha.com<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3814143-us-weighs-providing-ukraine-with-aerovironments-switchblade-drones-nbc">https://seekingalpha.com/news/3814143-us-weighs-providing-ukraine-with-aerovironments-switchblade-drones-nbc</a><br /><br />defence-blog.com / Ukrainian Ministry of Defense <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://defence-blog.com/ukrainian-bayraktar-tb2-drones-successfully-attack-russian-convoys/">https://defence-blog.com/ukrainian-bayraktar-tb2-drones-successfully-attack-russian-convoys/</a>{% endraw %}
