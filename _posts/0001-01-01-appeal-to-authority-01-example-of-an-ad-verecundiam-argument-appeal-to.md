{% raw %}Example of an Ad Verecundiam argument (appeal to authority), which is often misused. When presented alone, without evidence or any other substantial backing, it is not useful in ascertaining truth.<br /><br />The subject matter, for the purpose of this post, is not relevant. It doesn't matter if the speaker is telling the truth or not, what matters is that there are no facts presented, only an opinion which is being presented as if it was a fact, to a body of people who will act on that opinion as if it was a fact.<br /><br />The only things supporting the contention are the gravity of the situation (note the formal environment and the clothes being worn) and the supposed 'authority' of the speaker (note the direct assertion of authority in the introduction,  the fancy gold braid of the uniform and the apparent medals adorning her chest).<br />see <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://fallacyhunt.wordpress.com/">http://fallacyhunt.wordpress.com/</a>{% endraw %}
