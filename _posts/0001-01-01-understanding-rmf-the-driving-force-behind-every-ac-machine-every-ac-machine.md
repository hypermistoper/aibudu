{% raw %}Every AC machine uses a rotating magnetic field, an invention that kicked off the industrial revolution. Can you guess how the RMF reached this stage! In this video, weâ€™ll travel through the minds of the geniuses behind the development of RMF. The greatest contribution can perhaps be attributed to Nikola Tesla, considered by many as the pioneering father of modern engineering. To understand how the design theories evolved over time, our trip will take us all the way through to a  glimpse of modern-day winding techniques and RMF production. <br /><br />We thank EMWorks for their FEA support.
