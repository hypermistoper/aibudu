{% raw %}Today we look at kingpin inclination angle, known as KPI or KPA. Largely a consquence of packaging, KPI does provide a degree of self centreing due to lifting the cars weight, and can help with jacking forces in spool equipped cars. It provides the opposite effect to caster though, so must be balanced accordingly.{% endraw %}
