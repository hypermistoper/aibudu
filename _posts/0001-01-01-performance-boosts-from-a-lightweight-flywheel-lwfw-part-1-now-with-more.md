{% raw %}Now with more math! Lightweight single mass flywheels are popular upgrades from the standard (and heavy) dual mass flywheel Porsche installed as standard on the Boxster and 911. But are lightweight flywheels a good idea? In this video I break down the math of lightweight vs. dual mass flywheels and show a theoretical benefit equivalent to about 10hp! Of course, in reality, the gains will certainly be smaller, and lightweight flywheels have some real downsides. In the next video, I will explore the problems with lightweight &quot;sport&quot; flywheels.{% endraw %}
