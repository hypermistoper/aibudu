{% raw %}Very few garden insects are bad bugs. Many of the bugs in our gardens are beneficial insects that can make your gardening easier. When you attract beneficial insects to your garden you encourage a natural approach to garden pest management. Adding a variety of flowers is a good start and providing food, water, and shelter can help you create a healthy, biodiverse garden ecosystem.
