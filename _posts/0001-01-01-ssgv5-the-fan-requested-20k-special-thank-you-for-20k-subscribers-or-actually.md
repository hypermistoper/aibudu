{% raw %}Thank you for 20k subscribers! or.. actually 26k. huh.<br /><br />JOIN THE DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/mqPPARKxwX">https://discord.gg/mqPPARKxwX</a><br /><br />Heres another “fan requested special”. I should probably do something completely different for next subscriber milestone video, since I basically had to force myself to make certain parts for this one. Speaking of specials, since I'm getting subscribers a lot faster, I won't be making a special for every 5-10k subs I get anymore due to my upload schedule already being slow, and I want to spread out the amount of subscriber milestone specials I do from now on.<br /><br />That was pretty negative. Something positive… uhhhh.. The next video is gonna be the forgotten land video! For real this time! It’ll be pretty big so it’ll probably take a while to make (probably longer than this one) but at least it's something to be excited for?<br /><br /><br /><br />Tags: Kirby, Kirby Garry's Mod, Kirby Animation, Kirby Gmod, Kirby SFM, Kirby Cartoon, Funny Animation, Cartoon Animation<br /><br />#Kirby #Gmod #KirbyGmod #KirbySFM #KirbyAnimation #Animation #GarrysMod #KirbyCartoon{% endraw %}
