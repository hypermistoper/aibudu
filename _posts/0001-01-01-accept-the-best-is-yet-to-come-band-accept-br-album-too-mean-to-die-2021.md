{% raw %}Band: Accept<br />Album: Too Mean To Die [2021]<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />Once I was a man of fortune<br />Lived my life with pearls and gold<br />Had my time with wine and roses<br />I never thought of getting old<br /><br />Time went by and I got wiser<br />Loved and lost, along the way<br />I found the meaning of forgiveness<br />Pardoned enemies and prey<br /><br />When it rains, I look for rainbows<br />When it’s dark, I see the stars<br />Call me a dreamer, call me naïve<br />I will always say, the best is yet to come<br />Call me a simple man, call me naïve<br />On my dying bed I’ll say, thе best is yet to come<br /><br />Many timеs, I feel like screaming<br />Bang my head against the wall<br />Watch my luck run through my fingers<br />Losing faith in all<br /><br />Then I close my eyes in silence<br />Feel the spirit, that I crave<br />April showers, bring May flowers<br />Growing on my grave<br />When it rains, I look for rainbows<br />When it’s dark, I see the stars<br />Call me a dreamer, call me naïve<br />I will always say the best is yet to come<br />Call me a simple man, call me naïve<br />On my dying bed I’ll say, the best is yet to come<br /><br />The best is yet to come<br />The best is yet to come<br /><br />When it rains, I look for rainbows<br />When it’s dark, I see the stars<br /><br />On my dying bed I’ll say, the best is yet to come<br /><br />On my dying bed I’ll say<br />The best is yet to come{% endraw %}
