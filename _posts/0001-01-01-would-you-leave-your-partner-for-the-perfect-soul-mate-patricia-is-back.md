It's a form of video that originated in South Korea that is based on the concept that there are people at home/work that may find themselves eating alone and feel a bit lonely. These videos are to help fill that void. <br /><br />I also talk about a story/case that has heavy on my mind and a lot of the times heart. <br />If you are ever feeling lonely while you eat - come take a seat and join me! I'll be here for you! <br /><br /><br />WELCOME TO ANOTHER MUKBANG! Today we are back with PATRICIA!!! Have you missed her? I feel like it's been tooo longggg. And this time the stakes are high in the game of who is the better debater hypothetically speaking hahah <br /><br /><br />#StephanieSoo<br />#Pasta<br />#Mukbang{% endraw %}
