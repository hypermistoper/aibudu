{% raw %}Captured from Heart of gold (2006)<br /><br />This old guitar ain't mine to keep<br />Just taking care of it now<br />It's been around for years and years<br />Just waiting in its old case<br />It's been up and down the country roads<br />It's brought a tear and a smile<br />It's seen its share of dreams and hopes<br />And never went out of style<br />The more I play it, the better it sounds<br />It cries when I leave it alone<br />Silently it waits for me<br />Or someone else I suppose<br /><br />This old guitar<br />This old guitar<br />This old guitar<br /><br />This old guitar has caught some breaks<br />But it never searched for gold<br />It can't be blamed for my mistakes<br />It only does what it's told<br />It's been a messenger in times of trouble<br />In times of hope and fear<br />When I get drunk and seeing double<br />It jumps behind the wheel and steers<br /><br />This old guitar ain't mine to keep<br />It's mine to play for a while<br />This old guitar ain't mine to keep<br />It's only mine for a while<br /><br />This old guitar<br />This old guitar<br />This old guitar<br />This old guitar<br />This old guitar<br />This old guitar<br />This old guitar{% endraw %}
