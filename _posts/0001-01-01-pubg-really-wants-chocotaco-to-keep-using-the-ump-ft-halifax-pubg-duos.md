{% raw %}It's another UMP Sanhok game, dear viewer, and the only notes I took were &quot;don't be that guy, please&quot; (you'll know who I mean) and &quot;mopping up Bootcamp. So clearly this is a riveting, breath-taking, you'll-never-be-the-same-again-after-watching-this-game kind of caper. Enjoy!  - Beth<br /><br />See choco stream LIVE at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitch.tv/chocotaco">http://www.twitch.tv/chocotaco</a><br />You can follow his Twitter here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/chocoTaco">https://twitter.com/chocoTaco</a><br /><br />Music: &quot;DuDa&quot; by Ian Post, from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artlist.io/">https://artlist.io/</a><br /><br />Keywords: PUBG gameplay, chocoTaco, #chocoTaco #PUBG #Halifax{% endraw %}
