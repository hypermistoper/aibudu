{% raw %}8’W x 8’L x 8’H<br />Painted aluminum structure placed in pool basin<br />Permanent public artwork, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia<br />2021<br />Designed by Javid JAH<br /><br />The polar opposite of Venus, Mars is the symbol of the masculine energy of the Sun - its fiery and determined nature assumes a linear form, a bold red originating from its alchemical association with Iron.<br /><br />Part of a permanent public art exhibition titled “The World of Spheres” installed in 2021. The World of Spheres explores this marginalized tradition of cosmology which offers a harmonious and inspiring story of the wisdom crystallized by the dance of the intergalactic orbs. Based on research by the great scholar and metaphysician Ibn al-’Arabi (1165-1240 CE), each orbit of the visible planets can be considered as a “sphere of influence” unveiling the unseen dimensions of creation. It is through contemplation of these subtle layers of reality which ultimately leads to an illumination of one’s intellect. In search of experiencing the radiance of this cosmic light, or noor (نور), this exhibition re-visits the archetypal knowledge of the planetary orbits through a series of jewel-like lamps positioned along Jeddah’s new corniche.<br /><br /><br />Curated by Umbereen Inayet<br />Art Direction by Swizz Beats<br /><br />Team:<br />Lead Artist &amp; Designer: Javid JAH<br />Fabrication - Qube Inc<br />Engineering - Blackwell<br />Graphic Design &amp; Drafting - Carol Ann Apilado<br />Assistants - Aleem Velji, Aaron Lawless<br />Paint - Dudeman<br /><br />Commissioning Body:<br />Far Right Productions, Good Intentions &amp; Sela Development<br />Formula One Jeddah Street Circuit{% endraw %}
