{% raw %}This is a set of Planetary Housing plates from a Caterpillar 785 Haul Truck transmission. The bushings in the reaction pin (guide rod) positions are loose and need to be replaced. In this video we show making the new bushings on the lathe including drilling, reaming and machining. We also show the cryo-freezing and shrink fit installation of the bushings into the plates using liquid nitrogen.<br /><br />In this video we are using:<br />- Hafco TM-1740G Lathe<br /><br />Join our channel:<br />We upload new videos every Friday at 5pm AEST!
