{% raw %}The US has announced a $800 million military assistance package to Ukraine which includes 11 Mi-17 Hip helicopters. The choppers are part of a larger aid that contains heavy weaponry equipment for Ukraine to repel the Russian offensive. According to reports, Zelensky requested the US to provide its Mi-17 helicopters in a conversation with Biden on April 13. The Mi-17 “Hip” is considered to be one of the world's most modern transport helicopters. The Russian-made chopper is designed to transport cargo both within the cabin and on an external sling. Will the Mi-17 choppers help Zelensky's war against Russia?<br />#Ukraine #Mi17 #Helicopters #Russia #USMilitary #Biden #Zelensky #Donbas #Moscow #Kyiv<br /><br /><br />CRUX is your daily video news guide to the big events that are shaping our world.
