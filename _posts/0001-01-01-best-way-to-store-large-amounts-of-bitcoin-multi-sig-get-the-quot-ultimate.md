After that, you'll probably want to graduate to using a hardware wallet (single-sig) for amounts up to about $10,000.<br /><br />For larger amounts of Bitcoin, my favorite storage solution is multi-sig (multi-signature, where you need multiple keys to move your Bitcoin). These keys/hardware wallets can be stored in a geographically dispersed way, which renders home attacks ineffective.<br /><br />With collaborative custody multi-sig, a company like Casa or Unchained Capital holds one or more of your keys. They do not hold enough keys to move your Bitcoin on their own, but just enough to help you out in case you lose one or more keys.<br /><br />With 2/3 multi-sig, you need 2 signatures to move your Bitcoin. With 3/5 multi-sig, you need 3 signatures to move your Bitcoin.<br /><br />Consider using different vendors for each of your hardware wallets (Trezor, Blockstream Jade, Coldcard), in order to guard against a single-vendor attack.<br /><br />Collaborative custody is great for beginners, but as you become a more serious Bitcoiner and don't want to leak privacy or compromise your personal security, it makes more sense to set up DIY multi-vendor multi-sig, which I discuss in the following 2 paid lectures:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.trader.university/courses/38824-the-ultimate-guide-to-bitcoin/lessons/778561-the-ultimate-bitcoin-storage-solution">https://www.trader.university/courses/38824-the-ultimate-guide-to-bitcoin/lessons/778561-the-ultimate-bitcoin-storage-solution</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.trader.university/courses/38824-the-ultimate-guide-to-bitcoin/lessons/778562-the-ultimate-bitcoin-storage-solution">https://www.trader.university/courses/38824-the-ultimate-guide-to-bitcoin/lessons/778562-the-ultimate-bitcoin-storage-solution</a><br /><br />Not investment advice!
