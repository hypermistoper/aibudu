It is an Enslave 5 list that i have put together with the added touch of Mandrake. We will be using Mandrake in this deck as a way to re-enable Damien's order ability after it has been played, or if you prefer, you could also utilise it on Stefan to play additional tactic cards. I find Mandrake to be a reliable inclusion to the deck because in worse case scenario you could use it in a similar way as spores, and reset a unit with a tall boost, which gives us many versatile options. The best use of Mandrake on Stefan would be to aim to go for three bribery plays, which can high roll at time for crazy good value!<br /><br />For thinning and tempo in this deck, we have 2x Blight maker packages, Dead Mans Tongue, Fercart and Menno. By the end of a match you should have no issue in drawing all of your gold cards. You can utilise the mentioned cards to gain round control, and then decide if you wish to go for the 2-0 or a long round 3. Most likely because we have so much control in this deck, it would be advisable to play it over a long round 3, but as always consider your opponents deck and strategy when deciding.<br /><br />This deck has just about every answer to the current meta. You can take your opponents units so they cannot be replayed from graveyard, and also play your opponents strategy against them.<br /><br />I hope you will all enjoy this list my friends, it took me on a fairly good wining streak!<br /><br />KG{% endraw %}
