A show about adventure, excitement and friendship… as long as you accept that the people you call friends are also the ones you find extremely annoying. Sometimes it’s even a show about cars, reviewing Italian classics, hot hatchbacks, muscle cars, pick-up trucks, luxury vehicles and more. There’s something for everyone (If you like middle-aged men doing things with cars, then this is the show for you!)  <br /><br />Prime Video has thousands of popular movies and TV shows, including award-winning Amazon Originals, plus live sport and more. All included with Prime!<br /><br />#TheGrandTour #PrimeVideo #ClarksonsFarm{% endraw %}
