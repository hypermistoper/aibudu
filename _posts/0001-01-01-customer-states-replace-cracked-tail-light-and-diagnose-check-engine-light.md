The PCM can detect when there's either a small or large one and will illuminate the check engine light. The EVAPs purpose is to contain any fumes released from gasoline and prevent them from seeping out and impacting the environment.<br />0:37 This one is scary. The exhaust that is broken off leads to the gas tank melting. They are really lucky nothing else happened or the car caught on fire like the one in the 3rd clip. <br />0:50 Vehicle is a Lincoln Town Car. The technician said they saw the fire start underneath the vehicle. They are thinking it was caused by the catalytic converter or either it had a really bad misfire. With the vehicle catching on fire right away, they have no idea why the vehicle even came in in the first place. <br />1:12 No extra info. Never seen this myself personally but I would think it's a problem with the switch itself.<br />1:19 The technician said he's not even sure how he managed to drive this to the shop. He could barely drive it into the shop.<br />Technician also said: &quot;He would have at the minimum needed a subframe with control arms and bolts, rack + lines, his tires were bald. Without working up the estimate he asked how much I thought and I said upwards of 3,000.&quot; The vehicle was a 1998 Buick Century.<br />1:34 Technician said: &quot;Some more info if it matters, it was in those little NV200 Nissan work panel vans. The steel must have been of a ridiculously poor quality cause it cracked itself under normal wear conditions.&quot;<br />1:42 Looks like the customer hit a pretty bad pothole. Unfortunately, he will be needed a new wheel.<br />1:50 Looks like they used an air hammer trying to get those lug nuts off. They will be needing a new wheel, studs, and lug nuts. <br />1:58 Technician said: &quot;Definitely no warranty. The customer has a procharger on it, and burnout rubber on the rear lol.&quot;<br />2:16 The vehicle is a Dodge Dart (didn't mention the year) but they have a 1 piece design where the exhaust manifold is connected to the catalytic converter. So to remove the catalytic converter you'd have to unbolt the exhaust manifold so instead, they just cut it off. Brutal...<br />2:27 Use factory-recommended jacking points when working on any vehicle.<br />2:35 The outer tie-rod end is connected to the Coilover using zip-ties. <br />Maybe they stripped the threads for the outer tie-rod end? Either way... sketchy!<br />2:43 As mentioned 8 cuts in total were made but they had no luck!<br />Looks like they are going to weld it back up for the customer.<br />2:58 I'm going to guess they possibly didn't bleed the brakes properly so the brake pedal was very soft and couldn't stop the vehicle. Very unfortunate, especially after 5 years of working on the car.<br />3:12 Outro. Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
