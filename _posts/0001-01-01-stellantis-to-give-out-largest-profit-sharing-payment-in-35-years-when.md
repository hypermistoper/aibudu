{% raw %}When Peugeot and Fiat Chrysler automobiles combined, many worried about what another merger could mean to company profits and auto worker fortunes. One year in, things are looking promising, and line workers will soon receive an extensive bonus check. Eligible UAW workers will get paid up to $14,670. The union represents about 43,000 Stellantis workers. This is the largest profit-sharing amount in 35 years.{% endraw %}
