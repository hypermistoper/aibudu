Evidence &amp; Rakaa Iriscience (Dilated Peoples)<br />Produced by Logophobia<br /><br />Catapults Ent 2013<br />Babushka Media Group 2013<br /><br />---<br /><br />It all started back in '97<br />An adolescent with big dreams<br />And sick skeems, whenever the knowledge's tested<br />She had the hottest essence, the whole nine yards<br />Enough to make my mind go, oh my gosh<br />She had me hooked like addiction to drugs<br />The proper term for the moment, unconditional love<br />Just like the crips and the bloods, she had me howering over the streets<br />She's the reason for this, and considering my solo release<br />The reason why I even flow over beats<br />The reason why I, Prop Dylan even rose from defeat<br />Now I am standing on both of my feet, don<br />She's my life, my shoulder to weep on<br />She's gods gift to the man, yes<br />Fullfilling my list of demand, it's sick when I fantisize<br />About a life without her body and soul<br />Without her shine in my life, i am rock bottom in soil<br /><br />[chorusx2]Can you imagine a goddess, who lifts you up<br />No matter how hard it is, when it gets corrupt<br />She's there for you, wiping up the drips of blood<br />Never quick to judge, she only wish for love[/chorus]<br /><br />She had me feeling like a king with a crow<br />Cuz everytime that I mentioned her name, heads were spinning around<br />Our steps quivered the ground, in every town that we walked<br />Loud when she talked, getting rounds of applause<br />She took me down to New York, so I could spot her stomping grounds<br />She picked me up, straight out the box of lost and found<br />Whenever I was bossed and tossed around<br />She told me to walk my own path, like a nomad<br />Never will I lose her, that'll be the day they put a toetag<br />On my notepad, there's no match, for a starving artist<br />I was partly cautious, but she was all I wanted<br />From March to August, yeah I fought for her heart<br />Even though I was born the chosen one like the Dalai Lamas<br />Out the darkest waters, she bloomed to a queen<br />Soon to be free, when I am persuing my dreams<br /><br />[chorusx2]<br /><br />It's not just sunny days, cuz now the page has been flipped<br />From a saint to a dangerous sadistic b*tch<br />What a waist of a gift, traded for the devil inside<br />I'ma never be bitter instead I'ma thrive<br />But I want her dead or alive, whenever she's spreading her thies<br />For a lot of dudes, just to knock 'em boots, like a prostitute<br />All of this cuz she got alot of a's and o's<br />Like a conquered boxers, locker room<br />Guess it's the shocking truth, that keeps on chasing me down<br />With a foot to the neck, when I am placed on the ground<br />But she's right there, as a boost of confidence<br />Helps me out whenever I lose my common sense<br />What if I gave her a second to breathe<br />Would it be like that day when I got swept up my feet, huh?<br /><br />[chorusx2]{% endraw %}
