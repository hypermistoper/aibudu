{% raw %}Original Video by Philip Kapadia: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/DhhVr5iLF-c">https://youtu.be/DhhVr5iLF-c</a><br /><br />The challenge facing our climate is the greatest existential threat of our lifetime. The actions will take now will determine the future for generations to come. Now is not a time for half measures nor is it a time where we can we afford to continue our prioritization of profit over people. Climate change is greater than any one of us, but it requires every single one of us to come together to ensure there can and will be a future for the next to come.<br /><br />This isn't a problem half measures can solve. It goes beyond energy efficiency and zero net emissions. We need to actively remove carbon from the atmosphere -- and do so within the next ten years or else we face irreparable damage to our atmosphere. The implications are huge-- mass disease caused by carbon pollution, rising sea levels, extinction, shortages of every major resource, migration inland. The cost of waiting far exceeds the price to act now. We need bold policies that put the life and continuity of humankind above profit.  <br /><br />Make sure to like and share with everyone you know!<br />We need to spread these information, we need our society to wake up!<br /><br />#climatechange #shortfilm{% endraw %}
