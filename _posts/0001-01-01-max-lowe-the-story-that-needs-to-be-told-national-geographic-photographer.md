{% raw %}National Geographic photographer/writer Max Lowe has spent his life in the wilderness. Through the National Geographic Adventure Blog and his own projects, he shares his experiences of extraordinary moments, wildlife, people and places. &quot;Photography is not an end in itself. It takes me to incredible places and shows me a view that I might have missed entirely were I not looking through the lens of my camera.&quot;{% endraw %}
