{% raw %}Acclaimed filmmaker Joanna Hogg writes and directs this beautifully-crafted, intimate portrait of a young artist's first love and self-discovery. Featuring magnificent performances from an exquisite cast, &quot;The Souvenir&quot; stars Honor Swinton Byrne as a young aspiring filmmaker in the 1980s who falls into a tumultuous romance with a compelling yet dubious man (Tom Burke). Despite the concerns of her mother (Tilda Swinton) and friends, she becomes further enmeshed in this troubled relationship as she begins to discover her own artistic voice.{% endraw %}
