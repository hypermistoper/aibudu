{% raw %}From our last live class at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.cfibootcamp.com">http://www.cfibootcamp.com</a><br /><br />Mike goes over exactly how the propeller governor system works, why it needs to change blade angles and how it keeps a constant RPM.  CFI Boot Camp is the place that explains the whys behind the rote knowledge pilots collect.  At the CFI level complete, accurate and well presented lessons are the hallmark of being an instructor.  Watch Mike as he explains a complicated system in a way that is understandable and with enough detail that you can apply the information right away.<br /><br />Please don't be offended by the call outs we present for the school, like the phone number or website.  If you want to join us or take a class online this is one of the ways we can communicate to you.  <br /><br />Look for our ad in the November issue of Flight Training Magazine.<br /><br />We are going to post a complete lesson or two from the live class in a  few days.  It will be very rich in content so be on the look out for that.<br /><br />- CFI Boot Camp Staff{% endraw %}
