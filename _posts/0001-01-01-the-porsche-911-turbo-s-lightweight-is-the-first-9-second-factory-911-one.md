It subtracts 80 lbs from the overall package, resulting in 0-60 times in the *low 2's* and a quarter mile number in the 9's at 140 MPH. This is an insanely quick car, especially for only (I know, &quot;only&quot;) $200,000. The world's most well rounded daily driver supercar has only gotten better, and faster accelerating than any 911 before it. <br /><br />Porsche provided the vehicle, insurance, and a tank of fuel for this review. <br /><br />Use Off The Record! and ALWAYS fight your tickets!
