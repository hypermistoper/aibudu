Born outside London in 1915, he discovered the nearby Buddhist Lodge at a young age. After moving to the United States in 1938, Alan became an Episcopal priest for a time, and then relocated to Millbrook, New York, where he wrote his pivotal book The Wisdom of Insecurity: A Message for an Age of Anxiety. In 1951 he moved to San Francisco where he began teaching Buddhist studies, and in 1956 began his popular radio show, “Way Beyond the West.” By the early sixties, Alan’s radio talks aired nationally and the counterculture movement adopted him as a spiritual spokesperson. He wrote and traveled regularly until his passing in 1973.<br /><br />𝗤𝘂𝗼𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗯𝘆 𝗔𝗹𝗮𝗻 𝗪𝗮𝘁𝘁𝘀<br />- Man suffers only because he takes seriously what the gods made for fun.<br />- We seldom realize, for example that our most private thoughts and emotions are not actually our own.<br />- The meaning of life is just to be alive.<br /><br />𝗕𝗼𝗼𝗸𝘀 𝗕𝘆 𝗔𝗹𝗮𝗻 𝗪𝗮𝘁𝘁𝘀<br />- The Wisdom of Insecurity<br />- The Way of Zen<br />- Tao : The Watercourse Way<br /><br />Buy them from the official Alan Watts Organization store : shorturl.at/eyF34<br /><br />𝗧𝗶𝗽𝗼𝗰𝘀 𝗱𝗶𝘀𝗰𝘂𝘀𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗯𝘆 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗿<br />Business Spirituality Religion Philosophy Psychology Culture Society Education Self Growth Motivation Time Space Science Zen Buddhism Taoism Hinduism Christianity Intellect Mind Soul Happiness Sadness Emotions Spirit Mushroom Psychedelics <br /><br />𝗦𝗶𝗺𝗶𝗹𝗮𝗿 𝗔𝘂𝘁𝗵𝗼𝗿𝘀<br />You can find the inspiration that will give you goosebumps from different authors and different speech styles.
