{% raw %}We refuse to accept a world where turtles, dolphins and coral reefs vanish<br />from our seas. We choose to bring forward a new era where everyone uses the<br />ocean sustainably.<br /><br />We will award The Earthshot Prize to the most outstanding efforts to meet this<br />challenge. To the innovators who revolutionise our understanding of life<br />underwater; to the leaders who end criminal and unsustainable fishing practices;<br />and to the technologists who repair coral reefs and show us how to remove<br />pollution from the ocean on a global scale. We choose a future where our children<br />can enjoy the ocean for years to come, and where the ocean can continue to<br />sustain and enrich all life on Earth.<br /><br />Subscribe to The Earthshot Prize:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBKGuPLVff4r4-moTh9L7iw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBKGuPLVff4r4-moTh9L7iw</a><br />Earthshot Prize on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/earthshotprize/">https://www.instagram.com/earthshotprize/</a><br />Earthshot Prize on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EarthshotPrize">https://twitter.com/EarthshotPrize</a>{% endraw %}
