Please wear proper safety equipment when making soap.<br /><br />Rich and creamy handmade soap recipe:<br /><br />Recipe calculated with: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soapee.com/calculator">https://soapee.com/calculator</a><br /><br />Oils:<br />240 g olive oil (40%)<br />30 g castor oil (5%)<br />30 g avocado oil (5%)<br />174 g coconut oil (29%)<br />126 g shea butter (21%)<br /><br />Lye solution:<br />138 g distilled water<br />10 g citric acid<br />89 g sodium hydroxide (83 g if not using citric acid)<br /><br />(38% lye concentration, 6% superfat)<br /><br />Additives:<br />2 egg yolks<br />10 ml essential oils<br />3 tsp yellow illite clay<br /><br />Cure the soap for 4-6 weeks before using it on your skin.<br /><br />â—‹ Citric acid information<br /><br />When citric acid and sodium hydroxide lye (NaOH) are combined, sodium citrate is created. Sodium citrate works as a chelator in soap.<br /><br />A chelator traps metal ions such as calcium and magnesium that can be found in tap water.<br /><br />These metal contaminants can cause rancidity and soap scum in handmade soap.<br /><br />A chelator binds to these metals so that they canâ€™t bind to the soap molecules. This way the soap wonâ€™t react with them and the soap's lather improves + shelf life increases.<br /><br />Citric acid does not lower the pH of soap. Instead it consumes some of the lye and increases the superfat. Add 6 g extra lye for every 10 g of citric acid added to a soap recipe if you want to keep the superfat % at the same level.<br /><br />How much citric acid should be added to soap?<br /><br />Usage rate in bar soap is 1-2% of the oil weight.<br /><br />How to use citric acid<br /><br />Add citric acid to the distilled water and dissolve completely before adding the lye, or make a separate solution of citric acid and distilled water and add to the oils.<br /><br />Soap making equipment*<br /><br />â—‹ Safety glasses - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3pP99gz">https://amzn.to/3pP99gz</a><br />â—‹ Gloves - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3gjEViA">https://amzn.to/3gjEViA</a><br />â—‹ Braun multiquick stick blender (black colored version) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35h3GFO">https://amzn.to/35h3GFO</a><br />â—‹ Infrared thermometer - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3fXLx6e">https://amzn.to/3fXLx6e</a><br />â—‹ Digital scale - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3zmJSOR">https://amzn.to/3zmJSOR</a><br />â—‹ High precision scale - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/39YRc8t">https://amzn.to/39YRc8t</a><br />â—‹ Spatulas - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3zo8DdB">https://amzn.to/3zo8DdB</a><br />â—‹ Glass bowl - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Cvglnw">https://amzn.to/3Cvglnw</a><br />â—‹ Funnel pitchers for easy pouring - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3aYb9h1">https://amzn.to/3aYb9h1</a><br />â—‹ Stainless steel pitcher - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3nNQOzU">https://amzn.to/3nNQOzU</a><br />â—‹ Silicone molds:<br />â—‹ Single cavity mold - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3cAEIW0">https://amzn.to/3cAEIW0</a><br />â—‹ Silicone loaf mold - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35gS05S">https://amzn.to/35gS05S</a><br />â—‹ Small wooden soap mold with silicone lining - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3pVdn6b">https://amzn.to/3pVdn6b</a><br />â—‹ Cafe de savon wire cutter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://item.rakuten.co.jp/cafe-de-savon/f3090601/">https://item.rakuten.co.jp/cafe-de-savon/f3090601/</a><br />â—‹ Guide - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://item.rakuten.co.jp/cafe-de-savon/f3081202/">https://item.rakuten.co.jp/cafe-de-savon/f3081202/</a><br />â—‹ Swiss star stainless steel vegetable peeler for beveling soaps - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ak4VHW">https://amzn.to/3ak4VHW</a><br />â—‹ Mini mixer - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35dvECc">https://amzn.to/35dvECc</a><br /><br />Recommended reading:<br /><br />â—‹ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3iIllh5">https://amzn.to/3iIllh5</a><br /><br />As an amazon associate I earn from qualifying purchases.<br /><br />*amazon links are affiliate links.
