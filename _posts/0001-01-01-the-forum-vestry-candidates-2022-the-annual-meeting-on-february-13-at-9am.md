{% raw %}The Annual Meeting on February 13 at 9am will elect members of the vestry. The vestry is the legal representative of the parish with regard to all matters pertaining to its corporate property (that is to say, the vestry functions like a non-profit board). Our vestry consists of nine members, elected to staggered three year terms. This year's candidates are Magdalene Linck, Robert Lowes, and Heidi Volkl (all for first terms). You can read more and register for the meeting at www.holycommunion.net/annual-meeting{% endraw %}
