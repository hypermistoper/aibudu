These are my own, honest opinions. Not a sponsored video - I have never accepted money from a company in exchange for a video. <br /><br />(Some items listed above are accompanied by affiliate links, meaning I earn a small commission if a purchase is made through my links. This has no impact on the cost to the consumer. I link to products this way whenever possible, and it has no bearing on the products I choose to review or recommend. I would link the products on Ulta/Sephora/whatever brand’s website anyway as a means of connecting you to further info on the products, so now it simply offers the potential for a slight financial benefit to me, which I greatly appreciate as I do not ever do sponsored videos. Feel free to use, or not use, the links provided. I do not have any coupon codes. After being asked in the comments section about links/coupon codes/how they work and why I use them, I felt like providing this explanation! Thanks!)<br /><br />Profound Thought:<br />&quot;We can never obtain peace in the outer world until we make peace with ourselves.&quot; <br />-Dalai Lama<br /><br />Random Thought:<br />My favorite thing to get from our local Thai restaurant (Thai-D!) is pineapple fried rice. It is SO good. Bubba and Bitty are always wanting bites of it too... now I'm remembering I ate a lot of that while pregnant with them!{% endraw %}
