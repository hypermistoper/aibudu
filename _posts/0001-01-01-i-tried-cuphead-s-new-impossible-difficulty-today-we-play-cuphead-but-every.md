{% raw %}Today we play Cuphead but every boss in the game is buffed to be almost impossible. So how will a speedrunner compare to the impossible difficulty?<br /><br />Get Cuphead Master Quest here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cuphead/mods/4">https://www.nexusmods.com/cuphead/mods/4</a><br /><br />My 2nd channel (WEEKLY UPLOADS): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/eaziestspeezy">https://www.youtube.com/eaziestspeezy</a><br />Watch live at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy">https://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy</a><br /><br />▶ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy">https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy</a><br />▶ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/">https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/</a><br />▶ Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://eazyspeezy.com">https://eazyspeezy.com</a><br /><br />Edited by: @The Suited Bird <br /><br />This mod takes Cuphead to its absolute limits. This is quite possibly the hardest version of Cuphead that you may ever play, and, as a speedrunner, it was really fun to see how I stacked up to the difficulty.<br /><br />My channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!<br /><br />#EazySpeezy #Cuphead #ImpossibleDifficulty{% endraw %}
