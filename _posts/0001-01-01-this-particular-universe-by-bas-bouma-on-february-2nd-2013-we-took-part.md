{% raw %}On February 2nd 2013 we took part in the multi-medial Pale Blue Dot concert in Utrecht. The Pale Blue Dot concert consisted of a series of pieces written by young Dutch composers and performed by an acoustic ensemble of musicians. The pieces were all inspired by the famous photograph of the Earth, taken by the Voyager 1 space probe in 1990 from 6 billion kilometres away. These compositions were accompanied by artists from different disciplines.<br /><br />We were invited by Bas Bouma to create visuals to accompany his piece &quot;This Particular Universe&quot;. His piece explores the life of the Universe and the patterns within it, from the Big Bang to the formation of the solar system to the appearance of the first tiny life forms on Earth and finally to the moment when human beings take a picture of themselves from six billion kilometres away. We were happy to accept and created a fifteen minute interactive live performance based on &quot;This Particular Universe&quot; to accompany the musicians.<br /><br />For more info visit: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://basbouma.nl">http://basbouma.nl</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://front404.com">http://front404.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thepalebluedot.nl">http://thepalebluedot.nl</a>{% endraw %}
