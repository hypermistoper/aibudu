But the Queen intervened to ensure Charlotte would not be known as 'Lady Charlotte', according to a royal historian. Meanwhile, Harry and Meghan's children are titleless and are known as Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor and Lilibet Diana Mountbatten-Windsor.<br />Her Royal Highness Princess Charlotte of Cambridge was born in 2015, the second child of the future King and Queen, Prince William and Kate, Duchess of Cambridge. Like her elder brother Prince George, Charlotte has held her HRH and Princess style since birth. But the Letters Patent of 1917 issued by King George V determined that Charlotte would not actually have been eligible for a Princess title from birth.<br /><br />#Royalnews #BritishRoyal #PrinceHarry #Harry #MeghanMarkle #Meghan #PrinceWilliam #KateMiddleton #Queen #QueenElizabeth #PrinceCharles #Diana #Camilla #Philip #Archie #Lilibet #George #Sussexes #Cambridges #Duke #Duchess #RoyalRift #Latestnews #HarryMemoir{% endraw %}
