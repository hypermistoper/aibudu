{% raw %}The question is what is specific intent?<br />And the answer is simple specific intent means that you specifically did something with the intent to do that which you specifically did so if I get up and I want to punch this cameraman because he's shooting me at an angle that I don't like and I punch him well I had the specific intent to punch him and I did punch him that is a crime that is a crime that requires specific in ten assault and battery and I had that specific intent because I got up with the intent to him and I hit him that's a crime that specific intent.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.thematianfirm.com">http://www.thematianfirm.com</a>{% endraw %}
