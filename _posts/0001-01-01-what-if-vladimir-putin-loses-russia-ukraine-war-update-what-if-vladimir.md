{% raw %}What If Vladimir Putin Loses? Russia Ukraine War Update<br /><br />Russian President Vladimir Putin has made a strategic blunder by invading Ukraine. He has misjudged the political tenor of the country, which was not waiting to be liberated by Russian soldiers. He has misjudged the United States, the European Union, and a number of countries—including Australia, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea—all of which were capable of collective action before the war and all of which are now bent on Russia’s defeat in Ukraine. The United States and its allies and partners are imposing harsh costs on Moscow. Every war is a battle for public opinion, and Putin’s war in Ukraine has—in an age of mass-media imagery—associated Russia with an unprovoked attack on a peaceful neighbor, with mass humanitarian suffering, and with manifold war crimes. At every turn, the ensuing outrage will be an obstacle to Russian foreign policy in the future.<br />Full News: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-03-04/what-if-russia-loses">https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/ukraine/2022-03-04/what-if-russia-loses</a><br /><br />#Google.com<br /><br /><br />For any business enquiry &amp; copyright issue:   bithy723@gmail.com<br /><br /><br /><br />All Footage are collect from videoblocks premium account.<br />License Proof:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZPvL_jZFwGNnn_4n4VmkxPPrMp8NhUkG">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZPvL_jZFwGNnn_4n4VmkxPPrMp8NhUkG</a><br /><br />some of related channel: CaspianReport , Whatifalthist , Knowledgia , Economics Explained , China Uncensored , The Armchair Historian , America Uncovered , Countryballs Explained , DW Documentary , Futurology , Economics AltSimplified , Economic Raven , Mahanology , Global Economics , VisualPolitik EN , PolyMatter , General Knowledge , Dr. Top 10 , OverSimplified , Jay Foreman , Good Times Bad Times<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />=========<br />This channel may use some copyrighted materials without specific authorization of the owner but contents used here falls under the “Fair Use”<br />Copyright Disclaimer under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
