{% raw %}Cucamelons are also known as Mouse Melons or Mexican Sour Gherkins. They are delicious little grape-sized cucumbers that taste like they have a twist of lime added to them. They take a while to get started (up to 3 weeks just to germinate), but are great croppers. Definitely a great vine to add to your veg patch.{% endraw %}
