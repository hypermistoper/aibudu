{% raw %}Description<br />So apparently hour long presentations on defence investment weren't dry enough, so I'm dusting off the Economics degree (strongly recommended when pairing with military or strategic studies) to ask the question of what the economic situation may be if this war drags on.  <br /><br />Some are insisting sanctions are achieving nothing, and that Russia is well placed to outlast Ukraine. Others are convinced that Russia's war will grind to a halt under the weight of these sanctions. <br /><br />In this video, I look at some of the tactics Russia has been using to minimise the impact of sanctions, as well as the basic economic disparities between Russia and the Western powers backing Ukraine. Suffice to say, Russia is economically outmatched, but it has a variety of tools and strengths to leverage, including energy exports and a defence sector that has spent years moving towards self-reliance.<br /><br />Key Contact Points: <br />Send me data or submissions relevant to the topics I cover: <br />perunsubmissions@gmail.com<br /><br />Find me on Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/PerunAU">https://www.patreon.com/PerunAU</a> (I will be overhauling rewards soon to better suit the new audience)<br /><br />A note on calculations used:<br /><br />Comments on the impact on German GDP of an Oil and Gas Embargo sourced from this interview:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFl4aTIa5aY&amp;t=468s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFl4aTIa5aY&amp;t=468s</a><br /><br />Most quoted GDP figures are World Bank 2020<br /><br />Figures used for calculating NATO expenditure and potential expenditure generated using NATO declared 2021 defence expenditure and % GDP data which can lead to significant differences compared to, for example, simply applying spending ratios to the 2020WB figures. In particular, take that $1.4t figure as indicative, different methodologies can produce higher or lower results, varying by potentially hundreds of billions of dollars. None of that changes the core message.<br /><br />The reason for this potentially odd choice of statistics is to enable clear analysis on equipment spending - something we'll see next video when we unpack the Russian and NATO defence industries and resupply efforts.{% endraw %}
