{% raw %}When a woman brings in a stunning diamond necklace to the pawn shop, she's truly shocked at how much it's worth! Subscribe to Our Stories: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3lzSXhv">https://bit.ly/3lzSXhv</a> <br /><br />This fascinating documentary series goes behind-the-scenes with the kings of high-end pawnbroking. Just where do the rich sell their fast cars, fine wines and designer goods when they need money? When it comes to pawning luxurious items, James Constantinou's company, Prestige Pawnbrokers, is the place to go for the upper class wanting fast cash, and it's an empire on the move. Along with his quirky team of experts, James seeks to sort the fakes from the fortune making. It's a crazy world where anything luxurious and sometimes unimaginable has a possible ticket on it. Ranging from incredible jewels, to original art masterpieces and even submarines, behind every precious item there is a story to tell.<br /><br />In this episode, the staff at Prestige Pawnbrokers are blown away by two jaw-dropping diamond necklaces, owned by two very different clients. Single mum Marcella is looking for a better future for herself and her son and needs Â£20,000 to kick-start her music career, while wealthy mother-of-four Ingrid wants to raise capital for her new horse importation and training business. They both hope that family heirlooms that have been gathering dust can kick-start their new lives. But following a closer inspection of one of the necklaces, there's a sleepless night for staff member Patrick, who suspects one could be fake. And Prestige MD James Constantinou is excited by a very unusual yellow mini submarine, which policeman David wants to sell. James tests it in a 'James Bond-style' underwater joyride, as he attempts to impress a potential buyer.<br /><br />This film was first broadcast: 17 Apr 2014<br /><br />Watch More Documentaries<br />Our Life - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3A8xRMJ">https://bit.ly/3A8xRMJ</a> <br />Our History - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3rUpdhL">https://bit.ly/3rUpdhL</a> <br />Our World - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ftuckM">https://bit.ly/3ftuckM</a> <br />Our Stories - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ynfFyk">https://bit.ly/3ynfFyk</a> <br /><br />Welcome to Our Stories, the new home on YouTube for inspiring human stories that give us an insight into real people and real lives.
