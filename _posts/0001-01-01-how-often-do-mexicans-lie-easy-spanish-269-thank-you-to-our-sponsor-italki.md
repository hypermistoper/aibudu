Episodes are produced in local languages and contain subtitles in both the original language as well as in English.<br />---<br /><br />Subtitle translation: we try to translate our subtitles into English in the most literal way possible, without losing the meaning. While it may not always produce the best-sounding translation, we hope you find this useful as it should reduce the need for a dictionary or grammar book to understand every sentence.<br /><br />---<br />Host of this episode: Paulina Sainz<br />Editing: Rodrigo Dada<br />Camera: Rodrigo Dada<br />Subtitles: Harry Sumner, Johnny Yeldham, Iv√°n Vega, Agust√≠n Tripodi<br />Producer: Francisco A.
