{% raw %}Xinhua News Agency: Tomorrow is May 7. Twenty-three years ago, on May 7, 1999, NATO bombed the Chinese Embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, killing three Chinese journalists and wounding more than 20 Chinese diplomats. Now, 23 years later, as this special day approaches, what message does China want to send?<br /><br />Zhao Lijian: The Chinese people will never forget such barbaric atrocities of NATO and will never allow the historical tragedy to be repeated.<br /><br />NATO claims to be a defensive organization, but in fact it has repeatedly violated international law and wantonly waged war against sovereign states, undermining global and regional peace and killing and displacing a large number of innocent civilians. In its blind pursuit of “absolute security”, NATO engaged in five consecutive waves of eastward expansion after the end of the Cold War, which did not make Europe safer, but rather sowed the seed of conflict between Russia and Ukraine, reigniting conflict on the European continent.<br /><br />__________________<br />Powered by Shanghai Media Group, ShanghaiEye focuses on producing top-quality content for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube.<br />Nobody knows Shanghai better than us.<br />Please subscribe to us  ☻☻☻<br />__________________<br />For more stories, please click <br />■ What's up today in Shanghai, the most updated news of the city<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MNjpE4hspSVry8dR555getN">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MNjpE4hspSVry8dR555getN</a><br />■ Amazing Shanghai, exploring the unknown corners of the city,  learning the people, food and stories behind them<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MMVTWr-zIXjsS4hhSQPmyes">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MMVTWr-zIXjsS4hhSQPmyes</a><br />■ What Chinese people's lives are like during the post COVID-19 period<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MPrPTmIirpfgETu6VKVESXe">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MPrPTmIirpfgETu6VKVESXe</a><br />■ Views of foreign scholars on China and its affairs<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MO9ua_nSK6slRPdUl-ovjRe">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MO9ua_nSK6slRPdUl-ovjRe</a><br />■ Foreign faces in Shanghai, people living in this city sharing their true feelings<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MP0vJDSw23_1MCPJhAfGbiG">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MP0vJDSw23_1MCPJhAfGbiG</a><br />■ Mini-docs showing why China is the country it is today <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MOreRu2AbZ3ziIUyCcdBLwX">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MOreRu2AbZ3ziIUyCcdBLwX</a><br />__________________<br />☎Leave us messages if you have any suggestions or questions!<br />Thank you!{% endraw %}
