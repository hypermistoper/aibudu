Letâ€™s find out why.<br /><br />Intuition is the ability to understand something instinctively, without the need for conscious reasoning.<br />In simple words, you make a decision based on your gut feeling without any rational explanation.<br />But itâ€™s important to note that itâ€™s not a rush decision because you know it is the right thing to do.<br />Many things in our life are uncertain when there is no clear answer or the outcome is not clear so we must develop a sense of intuition to navigate us through this journey.<br />Just looking at some numbers can shed a light on the situation - 40% of couples end up divorcing. That is a high-risk venture.<br />60% of new businesses fail within the first 3 years. Thatâ€™s more than half of businesses guaranteed to fail. How do you make sense of that?<br />Well, the truth is that it doesnâ€™t make sense to start a business, so you need to have belief and intuition that things will work out if.<br />But the fact is that if you want to build a successful business you have to play against the odds and start a business. There is no way around it.<br />Same like any other skill you can train your intuition by using it and over time it will improve and become better.<br />On your road to success, you will have many challenges and obstacles and when nothing makes sense then you will have to use your intuition.<br />If the data and information that you have donâ€™t make sense you can rely on your intuition.<br /><br />I hope that you enjoyed this video and I was able to give you a quick overview of what Intuition is and what role it plays in our life.     _________________<br /><br />Hi, My name is Janis and Iâ€™m Content Creator and Entrepreneur.<br /><br />One thing that Iâ€™m really passionate about is Time Management.
