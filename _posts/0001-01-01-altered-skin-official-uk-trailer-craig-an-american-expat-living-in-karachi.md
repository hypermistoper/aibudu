{% raw %}Craig, an American expat living in Karachi is married to Insiya, a Pakistani doctor who contracts a virus called the MN-2, a devastating pathogen that causes uncontrollable outbursts of violent rage. With no cure in sight, the doctors have no choice but put her in a state of induced coma. Meanwhile, the virus continues to spread through the country with people infected by it referred to as ‘carriers’. As Insiya’s condition continues to deteriorate, it appears Craig has accepted her impending death. But when the dead body of an investigative reporter turns up in a sewer, it sets off a domino of events that leads Craig to the mystery behind the virus...and to the last chance at saving his wife.{% endraw %}
