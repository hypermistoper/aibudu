In this save tf2 sfm animation that isn't sfm we see tf2 Scout gaming who just dominated tf2 Spy gaming only to realize that tf2 Spy main used a dead ringer and destroys Scout main. So tf2 Spy does the my reaction to that information meme where we hear the  my reaction to that information song which is my reaction to that information fallen down from my reaction to that information undertale, and Spy is confronted by tf2 Pyro gaming, rip.<br /><br />Very cool and epic.<br />If you re-upload my content please remember to credit me!
