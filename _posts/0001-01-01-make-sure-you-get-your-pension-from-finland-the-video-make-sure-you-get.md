{% raw %}The video “Make sure you get your earnings-related pension from Finland” briefly explains the basics of Finnish earnings-related pensions. The instructions are intended mainly for persons who come from abroad to work in Finland.  <br /><br />Workers and self-employed persons pay pension insurance contributions in Finland based on their earnings. They accrue pension benefits based on the contributions they gave paid. In due time, they can apply for their Finnish earnings-related pension to be paid once they have reached their retirement age, regardless of where they live.<br /><br />Video: Tussitaikurit Oy / Marker Wizards Ltd.{% endraw %}
