And, the return journey back to O'Hare is only $2.25? Well, now you know.<br /><br />CTA wouldn't allow me to video the how the actual vending machines and turnstiles work but it is not only easy, personnel are always on hand at O'Hare to assist. Just put a $5.00 USD bill into the machine (it also makes change), press the &quot;Green Button&quot; and out spits a one-way ticket.  If planning to stay in Chicago and use Public Transit, opt for a 1-day, 3-day or 7 day card. Go to the transitchicago website for more routes, stops and information.<br /><br />Trains run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, every 10-12 minutes. Returning to O'Hare from Downtown Chicago, the fare is only $2.25 USD...such a deal and so easy!{% endraw %}
