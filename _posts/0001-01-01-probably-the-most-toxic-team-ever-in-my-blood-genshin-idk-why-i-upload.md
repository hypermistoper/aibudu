{% raw %}idk why I upload toxic vids<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />but literally wth that Ayaka is so fking dumb,like the c2 diona says in co-op for 5 secs.<br />Plus,I’m just adventure Rank 50,why need to say about my dmg?non of my characters talents are 7 (except diona const)<br />Like tbh why need to be so rude to someone?can’t they put themselves in other’s shoe?<br />cyber bullying was taught in school so I can take it,but seriously why judge someone?I just never pull on banners.you should never judge someone either their strong or weak characters.you can play anything you want nobody is stopping you!<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />#toxic #azdaha #diona #genshin #genshinimpact{% endraw %}
