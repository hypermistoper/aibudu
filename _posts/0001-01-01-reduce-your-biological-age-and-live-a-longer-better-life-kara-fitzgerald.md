Some people begin to age much sooner than others, while others seem to have golden genetics of youth on their side. What if you found out that scientific research is now able to reverse your biological clock up to 3 years? You may be skeptical, you may be curious, or you may be excited for what this means to your future. Dr. Kara Fitzgerald is a functional medicine physician and clinical director that just published a new book for the non-medical people trying to improve their health and age more gracefully called Younger You. She’s joining Tom and revealing everything you don’t know about methylation and epigenetics, why it matters to you and the simple things you can do to gain back 3 years of your biological clock in roughly 8 weeks.<br /><br />Check out Dr. Kara Fitzgerld’s Younger You: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3vsez5T">https://amzn.to/3vsez5T</a> <br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br /><br />0:00 | Introduction Dr. Kara Fitzgerald<br />1:43 | How DNA is Packaged &amp;Expressed<br />4:44 | Understanding DNA Methylation <br />9:22 | Methylation Cycle Explained<br />14:14 | Lifestyle Effects on Methylation<br />18:30 | Passing Stress Through DNA<br />24:41 | Inheriting Trauma and Resilience<br />27:28 | Unintended Generational Influence<br />37:35 | Methylation Diet Strategy<br />47:29 | Stress, Sleep, and Exercise<br /><br />QUOTES:<br /><br />“If we're going to turn back the hands of time by decades, are we going to, by extension, remove the molecules of wisdom that have embedded in our DNA?” [0:41]<br /><br />“If we're not sleeping, we're aging.[...] sleep is an essential component of good epigenetic expression. Insomnia ages people and that's been demonstrated…” [49:11]<br /><br />“Stress is one of the most pro aging experiences that we can have, and that we need to be paying attention to turning it off and not allowing it to drag us by the hair.” [51:04]<br /><br />“People who meditate regularly are biologically younger, but just one meditation experience can still have a favorable influence.” [52:28]<br /><br />“Exercise will turn back on those previously inhibited tumor suppressor genes [...] exercise is like eating a vegetable.” [53:28]<br /><br />Follow Dr. Kara Fitzgerald: <br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drkarafitzgerald.com/">https://www.drkarafitzgerald.com/</a> <br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Drkarafitzgerald">https://www.youtube.com/c/Drkarafitzgerald</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/kfitzgeraldnd">https://twitter.com/kfitzgeraldnd</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/drkarafitzgerald/">https://www.instagram.com/drkarafitzgerald/</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/DrKaraFitzgerald/">https://www.facebook.com/DrKaraFitzgerald/</a>{% endraw %}
