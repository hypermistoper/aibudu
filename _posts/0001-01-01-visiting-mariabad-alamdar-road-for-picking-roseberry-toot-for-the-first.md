{% raw %}For the first time in my life, I'm going to pick Roseberry (toot) in Mariabad/Alamdar Road with friends. Pakistan and Afghanistan Roseberry is a famous Roseberry called Ibrahim-Khani Roseberry (Toot)<br /><br />I met there with different people Sajjad Gohar, Ibrahim, Karim Bakhsh.<br /><br />Visitied Hazara Qabristan Mariabad. Sar Maidani, Beshti Zainab.<br />________________________________<br />Berries are low in calories and extremely nutritious. In addition to being high in antioxidants, they also contain several vitamins and minerals.<br />Berries, especially strawberries, are high in vitamin C. In fact, 1 cup (150 grams) of strawberries provides a whopping 150% of the RDI for vitamin C (20).<br />With the exception of vitamin C, all berries are fairly similar in terms of their vitamin and mineral content.<br />Below is the nutrition content of a 3.5-ounce (100-gram) serving of blackberries (19):<br /><br />Calories: 43<br />Vitamin C: 35% of the Reference Daily Intake (RDI)<br />Manganese: 32% of the RDI<br />Vitamin K1: 25% of the RDI<br />Copper: 8% of the RDI<br />Folate: 6% of the RDI<br />__________________<br />My name is Anwar Sarwari and I live in Melbourne, Australia.
