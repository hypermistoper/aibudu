{% raw %}Elden Ring is dense and such an open world game, that sometimes the best route can be difficult to find. After making it through Stormveil Castle and Godrick the Grafted, then tackling Liurnia of the Lakes and Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon - you might find yourself in a conundrum. Do you take on Caelid and Starscrouge Radahn? Do you head up into the Altus Plateau and attempt Leyndell, the Royal Capital? Or do you yolo your way into Mt. Gelmir? Dave Klein of DaveControl is here to help with a handy route guide to help you tackle the Elden Ring challenges ahead. Here is an Elden Ring guide on the best path to take after Liurnia of the Lakes.<br /><br />#EldenRing{% endraw %}
