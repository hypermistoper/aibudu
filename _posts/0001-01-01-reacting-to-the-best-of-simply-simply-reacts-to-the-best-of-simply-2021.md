This contains moments from when I met Babbsity in real life... when I Spoke To Emiru about Chips &amp; even cool moments of Mairo 64 speedrun reactions (like 120 stars or 16 stars). OTK Mizkif is in the video so I stole one of his Nintendo 64 boxes. Funny and epic video, so I also stole Emiru's chips. SM64 has had a &quot;golden age,&quot; so I'm happy to be able to cover it with SM64 speedrunner reacts videos! Hope you enjoy this twitch recap video!<br /><br />A HUGE new Mario 64 speedrun skip was discovered. Simply reacts to Super Mario 64 120 Star TAS Speedrun, actually not instead this is the BEST OF SIMPLY 2021, ENJOY!<br /><br />#simply #bestof #rewind{% endraw %}
