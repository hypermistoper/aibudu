{% raw %}Mike Ellicock asks us what 17 x 24 is and then tells us why it makes us so uncomfortable. In his talk, Mike walks the audience through the main misconceptions in the area of Maths and how we can overcome them.<br /><br />Mike Ellicock is the founding Chief Executive of National Numeracy an independent charity that launched in 2012.National Numeracy has a singular focus on enabling everyone in the UK to use numbers and data to make good decisions in their daily life. The charity looks to challenge the cultural acceptability of ‘I can’t do maths’ and draws upon a growing body of international evidence suggesting that if you value something, believe that you could do it (you just can’t do it, yet) and then put the effort in, almost anything is possible – including maths. Mike’s background is in business, the military and sport. <br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
