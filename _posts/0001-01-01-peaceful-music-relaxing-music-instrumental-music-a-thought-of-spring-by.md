{% raw %}Peaceful Music, Relaxing Music, Instrumental Music, &quot;A Thought of Spring&quot; by Tim Janis.   My instrumental music can help you find deep relaxation, relieve anxiety, and find peace. My music incorporates relaxing sounds of nature and features flute music, piano music, harp music, &amp; violin music.<br /><br />I am a composer from Maine and created my channel as a place to visit, relax and find peace. My music is often used for prayer and meditation and can be described as sleep music, calm music, yoga music, study music, peaceful music, spa music, beautiful music and relaxing music.<br /><br />I read all of my comments and love hearing from you. If you enjoy my music, please subscribe to my channel and join the community.<br /><br />As winter recedes and flowers begin to spring up there is a feeling of newness and rejuvenation.  Join me as we watch the early signs of Spring blossom around us.<br /><br />Come see me perform at Carnegie Hall in NYC on December 1st, 2017. :) There will be a special meet and greet backstage for all those that watch my YouTube videos. Please just send us a note in the comments and we will get back to you. <br /><br />Blessings &amp; peace, <br />Tim Janis<br /><br />Coming soon I will be  my new musical film &quot;Buttons&quot; with Dick Van Dyke, Jane Seymour, Katie McGrath, Ioan Gruffudd, Kate Winslet and additional music by Sir Paul McCartney.   I hope you enjoy it.{% endraw %}
