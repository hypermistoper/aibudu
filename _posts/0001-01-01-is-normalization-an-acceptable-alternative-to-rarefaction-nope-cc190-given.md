{% raw %}Given the controversy around rarefaction an alternative that has been proposed is to use relative abundance data or normalization. In this Code Club, Pat uses R to compare pairwise distances from a null community model calculated using rarefaction, relative abundances, and normalization using the SRS algorithm with vegdist and avgdist functions from the vegan R package. He'll show how to synthesize and visualize the data using tools from dplyr, ggplot2, and other tidyverse packages.<br /><br />You can find my blog post for this episode at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.riffomonas.org/code_club/2022-02-24-normalization.">https://www.riffomonas.org/code_club/2022-02-24-normalization.</a> The data were generated in our Kozich et al. 2013 paper (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01043-13)">http://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01043-13)</a> using samples from the Schloss et al. 2012 paper (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://doi.org/10.4161/gmic.21008).">http://doi.org/10.4161/gmic.21008).</a><br /><br />#SRS #vegdist #avgdist #ggplot2 #R #Rstudio #Rstats<br /><br />Want more practice on the concepts covered in Code Club?
