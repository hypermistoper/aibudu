{% raw %}Eight million tonnes of plastic ends up in the worldâ€™s oceans every year. Virginie Helias explains how one brand whose products have been part of the problem set about making them part of the solution, collecting plastic litter from beaches and turning it into new shampoo bottles. She argues big businesses need to step up if we are to create a circular economy where nothing is wasted.<br /><br />With 28 years of experience at Procter &amp; Gamble in Brand Management and Innovation, Virginie is Vice President of Global Sustainability. Her work has seen the company make sustainability a core business strategy, an innovation driver and a catalyst for a more resilient organisation.<br /><br /><br /><br />--<br /><br /><br /><br />At TEDxExeter 2017 our speakers explored ideas of HOPE - not wishing, not optimism, but hope - to challenge us and encourage us to keep moving forward to create a better world.
