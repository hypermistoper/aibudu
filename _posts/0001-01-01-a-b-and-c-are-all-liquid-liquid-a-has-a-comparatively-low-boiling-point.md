{% raw %}A,B and C are all liquid ,Liquid A has a comparatively low boiling point on heating liquid A vaporises completely either alone or by mixing with petrol ,Liquid A is being used increaseingly as a fuel in motor vehicles either alone or by mixing with petrol liquid B has very high boiling point it also vaporises completely on heating without leaving any residue liquid B is a conductor of electricity and used in making themometers Liquid C has a moderate boiling point On heating liquid C vaporises leaving behind a white solid D which is used in cooking vegetables the condensation of vapours from C give a liquid E which turns anhyfrous `CuSO_(4)` to blue (a) which liquid could be an element ? name this element . (b) which liquid could be a mixture ? name this mixture . ( c) which liquid could be a compound ? name this compound. ( d) what could the solid D be ? (e ) what do you think is liquid E ?{% endraw %}
