{% raw %}#fungaltoenails #calluses #callusremoval<br />A patient I last saw 11 months ago returns. Since he has fallen by the wayside, his feet have made no progress after his first visit. Now that he has returned, I trimmed his fungal toenails and the severe callus on his right big toe. Being pleased with the outcome, he has committed to visits every two months to get his feet back on track.{% endraw %}
