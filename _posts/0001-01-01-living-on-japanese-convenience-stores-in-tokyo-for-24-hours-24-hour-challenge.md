{% raw %}24 hour challenge to find the best convenience store (7-Eleven Vs. Lawson Vs. FamilyMart) of Tokyo, Japan! Thanks again to Turo!

Before going to Japan I thought it would be an impossible challenge to living on convenience store / gas station foods like 7-Eleven, but in Tokyo they have anything from a Ramen cooking station, to fried chicken, to pizza to burgers, to burritos to even pork buns. This was one of my top unique experiences in all of Asia (I’ve visited Taiwan and Korea last month), and up there with the dollar meal challenge, and vending machine videos! Enjoy this 24 hour challenge from Tokyo! <br /><br />Follow for live streams / Q&amp;A’s: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/iamlivingbobby">https://www.instagram.com/iamlivingbobby</a><br /><br />MY GEAR:<br />My Camera - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bhpho.to/2y0fueD">https://bhpho.to/2y0fueD</a><br />Cheap camera (still awesome ones in the used department): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bhpho.to/2NcTjZS">https://bhpho.to/2NcTjZS</a> <br />Main Lens - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bhpho.to/2xNiquO">https://bhpho.to/2xNiquO</a><br />Microphone - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bhpho.to/2OhcYKQ">https://bhpho.to/2OhcYKQ</a><br />Drone - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bhpho.to/2xSnnmd">https://bhpho.to/2xSnnmd</a><br /><br />MUSIC OF THIS VIDEO <br />Main songs used in the video: LAKEY INSPIRED<br />All the rest (click to get FREE trial):  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.mscbd.fm/iamlivingbobby">http://share.mscbd.fm/iamlivingbobby</a>{% endraw %}
