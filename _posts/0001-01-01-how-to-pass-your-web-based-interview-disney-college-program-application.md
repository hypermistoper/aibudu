{% raw %}Howdy! As a Disney College Program alumni, current Cast Member and merchandise trainer I thought I could give you some advice on one of the most stressful parts of the application process: the WBI, or Web-Based Interview. In this video, I give some tips, advice and even share some examples of often recycled WBI questions. I also recorded a VERY brief clip of my husband completing his WBI so I could show you guys. <br /><br />I hope I was able to help. I can't wait to guide y'all along the last step: the phone interview. Be sure to subscribe to see more DCP advice videos! Comment below any questions you have for me and let me know how it goes for you! When is your phone interview and how are you feeling about it? Sending lots of love and pixie dust your way~ Good luck, guys!<br />____________________________________<br />DCP APPLICATION STEP 1: GETTING A WBI:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJceArOw4jY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJceArOw4jY</a><br /><br />MORE DCP ADVICE VIDEOS: <br />-WHAT I WISH I KNEW AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DCP:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITj_LX55Oyc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITj_LX55Oyc</a><br />-DCP PACKING LIST+ADVICE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8EuzzOw2hA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8EuzzOw2hA</a><br />-YOUR FIRST DAYS IN THE DCP- EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWtJEZs0npY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWtJEZs0npY</a><br /><br />MY DCP VIDEOS:<br />-CHECKING IN, CASTING AND MOVING IN: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KovX3VtOUsA&amp;t=232s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KovX3VtOUsA&amp;t=232s</a><br />TRADITIONS + PARK ACCESS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTjWeHH43Lw&amp;t=139s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTjWeHH43Lw&amp;t=139s</a><br />____________________________________<br /><br />Hello if you're new!
