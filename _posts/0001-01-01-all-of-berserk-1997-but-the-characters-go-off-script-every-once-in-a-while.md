{% raw %}Mister Guts embarks on a journey with his pals to slay demons, save the princess and become the next Hokage.<br /><br />Berserk (1997): The Outtake Cut<br /><br />The idea was to take all of the episodes of the show, combine them into one and splice in all the outtakes to create a more lighthearted version with situations where characters break the 4th wall and then continue like nothing happened. Not every edit works, but I do find some of the scenes quite amusing in this context.<br />DISCLAIMER: Do not watch if this is your first time watching the series as you'll ruin the experience of watching the show and it's outtakes respectively.<br />Anyway I hope you enjoy as this took much longer to edit than expected.<br /><br />Original &quot;Put Your Grasses On&quot; intro video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIUMQa4jlbU">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIUMQa4jlbU</a><br /><br />Berserk anime (1997)<br />Directed by: Naohito Takahashi<br />Produced by: Toshio Nakatani &amp; Toshiaki Okuno<br />Written by: Yasuhiro Imagawa<br />Music by: Susumu Hirasawa<br />Studio: OLM, Inc.<br />Licensed by:<br />-Madman Entertainment<br />-AnimeWorks<br />-MVM Films<br /><br />I do not own the copyrighted material used in the video.
