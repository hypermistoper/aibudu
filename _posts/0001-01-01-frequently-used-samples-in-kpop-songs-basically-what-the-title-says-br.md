{% raw %}basically what the title says<br /><br />intro: hot pink - exid<br />outro: deep blue eyes - girls next door<br /><br />thumbnail: jinsoul from loona, woodz, lisa from blackpink, jhope from bts<br /><br />please don't reupload/remake this video using the audio from my video with or without credit. it took me a really long time to compile these samples. also all the samples are sped up/pitched up to a very odd number so you can't rip it lol support the original artists <br /><br />tags: kpop sample splice secret number dongkiz mont woodz hwasa mamamoo twice aqua loona jhope bts dreamcatcher teen top jamie blackpink lisa izone zgirls stray kids 3racha gidle nct 127{% endraw %}
