{% raw %}Professorial Fellow Nathan Hughes, Department of Sociological Studies, University of Sheffield, UK.<br /><br />The highly esteemed Professor Hughes was awarded a University of Otago William Evans Fellowship in 2018. <br /><br />Professor Hughes' research examines the influence of health and developmental difficulties on the risk of criminality and criminalisation among young people and young adults, with a particular focus on experiences of neurodevelopmental disorders and traumatic brain injury.<br /><br />Strong international evidence shows that neurodevelopmental disability, poor mental health, trauma, and experiences of child maltreatment all appear to increase the risk of exposure to criminal justice systems in adolescence.<br /><br />Come along to find out more about the persuasive evidence that could influence approaches to reforms relating to criminalisation on the basis of health and developmental difficulties.{% endraw %}
