{% raw %}Using natural light as one of the project’s fundamental guidelines, Casa Grecia was designed by Bernardo Pozas Diseño Residencial, in Mexico. As the house is located on a sloping lot facing West, creating views without boundaries has become an early design premise, making room to specify the project with Sky-frame’s frameless sliding doors. In such a way, the residence is a perfect example of finding a connection between spaces and their use.<br /><br /><br />Project: Bernardo Pozas Diseño Residencial<br />Windows and sliding doors: Sky-frame<br />Location: Monterrey, Mexico<br />Cover image: Daniel Cordón<br />Film: Mavix &amp; Architecture Hunter{% endraw %}
