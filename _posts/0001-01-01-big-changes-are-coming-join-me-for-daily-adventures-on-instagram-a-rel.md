I came here to try out a pretty special new vehicle all for myself: the all-electric ID. Buzz! Pretty sure I was the first person to ever take it off-roading....<br /><br />This video was produced in partnership with @Volkswagen - thanks so much for trusting me to drive the ID. Buzz! Please note: the ID. Buzz is a near-series prototype and not yet available for sale. (Which obviously made it all the more exciting to drive!)<br /><br />The campsite I filmed at near Austin Texas is the beautiful River Forest Haven: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://riverforesthaven.com">https://riverforesthaven.com</a> <br />Make sure you give them a visit if you’re planning to camp in the area!<br /><br />#VWIDBuzz #Volkswagen{% endraw %}
