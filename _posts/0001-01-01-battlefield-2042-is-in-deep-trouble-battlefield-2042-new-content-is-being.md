{% raw %}Battlefield 2042 new content is being delayed until early Summer 2022. This means a near 6-month wait for maps, weapons, vehicles and more. This is extremely disappointing news. Also, details on EA's Q3 Earnings call which gave us a bit of insight into how they feel about Battlefield right now.

I mainly do Warzone Pacific gameplay but I also play regular Call of Duty, Battlefield 2042 and I love Battle Royale. I often play solos, duos, trios and quads on my livestream. I have over 700 wins in Warzone and over 1000 hours experience in every Battlefield game. I hope to play more FPS games in 2022 and am looking forward to Call Of Duty Modern Warfare 2 launching in 2022. I hope you enjoy my Warzone sniper gameplay as much as I do making it.{% endraw %}
