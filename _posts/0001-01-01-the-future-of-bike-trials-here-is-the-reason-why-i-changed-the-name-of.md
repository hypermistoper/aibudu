{% raw %}Here is the reason why I changed the name of this channel to Super Rider. It's an intention for the future of the sport of bike trial. I think there is something special that can be done to bring our sport to more people, and this is how I'm going to do it. I'm putting it out into the universe, and if you're here now, you'll have a front row seat to see it happen. <br /><br />Super Rider was a segment of a show that aired in Japan (and was later adapted for three episodes in the UK) with the best riders, riding the hardest sections, in front of a live TV audience. This format captured my imagination as a young rider, and I still haven't given up on it. I believe bringing this format back to life - and with the innovation and creativity in our sport that has grown since then - will make a massive impact to all the trials riders around the world.<br /><br />I hope you believe. I hope you'll join me on this journey. <br /><br />A massive thank you to Chris Ratcliff for sending me the show footage that is featured in this video. <br /><br />Super Rider Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.superrider.tv">https://www.superrider.tv</a><br />JOIN THE NEW TRIALS DISCORD SERVER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/fNMpTTv2kz">https://discord.gg/fNMpTTv2kz</a><br />Ride with me on Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/superridertv">https://www.twitch.tv/superridertv</a><br /><br />My bike setup:<br />Hayes Dominion Brakes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3xANOLo">https://bit.ly/3xANOLo</a><br />Deity High Side Bar: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3CJdLtf">https://bit.ly/3CJdLtf</a><br /><br />Riding Gear: <br />Helmet - Giro Source MIPS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3FKBEmK">https://bit.ly/3FKBEmK</a><br />Shoes - Ride Concepts Livewire: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3FFFIog">https://bit.ly/3FFFIog</a><br />(If you click on any of these links to buy parts, it's a great way to support the channel!) <br /><br />Subscribe to my YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzn_TdK8HCt5XS8vlbTR4-A?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzn_TdK8HCt5XS8vlbTR4-A?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Follow me on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/aaronlutze/">https://www.instagram.com/aaronlutze/</a><br /><br />This video was shot on the following equipment: <br />Sony ZV-1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3bgppSu">https://amzn.to/3bgppSu</a> <br />GoPro 8 Black: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35g2anQ">https://amzn.to/35g2anQ</a> <br />Joby Gorillapod: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3becGQ5">https://amzn.to/3becGQ5</a> <br />Rode Lavalier Go Mic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2XjbAKN">https://amzn.to/2XjbAKN</a><br /><br />#superrider #tvshow #future #biketrials #mountainbike #goals #bike #mtb #streettrials #competition{% endraw %}
