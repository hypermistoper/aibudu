{% raw %}Sky News host Rowan Dean says we used to be able to laugh at communism but thanks to the “de-growth” agenda of the climate change cult - the joke is now on us.<br /><br />“In the good old days we used to be able to laugh at communism. It's ineptitude. It's shoddy workmanship. It's empty shelves. It's ugliness and misery,” Mr Dean said.<br /><br />“But in so many ways, thanks to the relentless de-growth agenda of the green climate change cult embraced by our politicians, banks and business leaders, shutting down our coal-fired power stations, defunding our energy investments, and the long march of the neo-Marxists through our education and legal institutions wreaking havoc with our culture, the joke is now firmly on us. <br /><br />“Russia is now so unafraid of the European Union and America under Biden that it marches into Ukraine with impunity, much as China may well be planning to do to Taiwan.”{% endraw %}
