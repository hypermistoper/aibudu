{% raw %}All-cash home buyers are continuing to inflate home prices through all real estate markets. While some called for a housing crash by this time there seems to be no collapse insight as some areas have seen a 6% increase since the beginning of the year. Even Zillow changed its yearly predictions when they saw that homes are still flying off the market, over the asking price. So who are these buyers? What should we expect for the next month?
