{% raw %}I've heard people say that blending alpaca and wool is essential to having an alpaca yarn that will keep it's shape in a garment because alpaca has no &quot;memory&quot; and the knitting will sag. I wanted to test some alpaca wool blends today so I'm carding 4 batts using my Brother drum carder with different amounts of alpaca and wool. Then I'll spin each batt and knit a swatch to see how the different amounts of wool affect the alpaca. This is a huge sampling project, so let's get spinning! <br /><br />❤ Did you love this video?
