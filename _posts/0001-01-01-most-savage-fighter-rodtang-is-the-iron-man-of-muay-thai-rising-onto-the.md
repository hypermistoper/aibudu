{% raw %}Rodtang is the Iron Man of Muay Thai. Rising onto the scene by giving Tenshin Nasukawa his toughest fight to date, he is now a full on superstar in the world of striking. His fights in One Championship proved that he is nearly unstoppable with his iron chin and relentless aggression. <br /><br />On March 26, he will face the pound for pound great Demetrious Johnson in a special rules fight. Who will win? I have no idea, but for sure the fans win.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.strikingacademy.com/legendary">http://www.strikingacademy.com/legendary</a> (75% OFF Founders) <br /><br />-----------------------------------<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/strikingbreakdowns">http://instagram.com/strikingbreakdowns</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/lawrencekenshinbreakdowns">http://facebook.com/lawrencekenshinbreakdowns</a>{% endraw %}
