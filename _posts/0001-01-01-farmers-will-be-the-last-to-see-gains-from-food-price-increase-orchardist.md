{% raw %}Orchardist and New South Wales Farmers Federation member Guy Gaeta says the increase in fresh food prices is not coming back to farmers.<br /><br />“We’ll be the last people to get them,” he told Sky News host Peta Credlin. <br /><br />He said supermarket chains will not show him the price they pay for produce.<br /><br />“They won’t show us that, we’ve asked them for it.<br /><br />“They seem to use the excuse of floods and droughts just to increase prices on the consumer,” he said.{% endraw %}
