{% raw %}I am very excited to share this video which shows you the multiple uses of grass and grass clippings in the garden, and the second half of the video shares what I think is the most exciting use for grass which is creating a JADAM liquid fertilizer for balanced plant growth using 100% free materials including the container itself as part of Project LEACS. I really hope you can see just how beneficial this resource is and even if you have slug problems you can still use grass for many different uses in your vegetable garden.<br /><br />Ambassador for Gardena: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gardena.com/uk/">https://www.gardena.com/uk/</a><br /><br />-üì∑Patreon-<br />Exclusive content for gardeners wanting more from their space: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/huwrichards">https://www.patreon.com/huwrichards</a> <br /><br />-‚úíÔ∏èOnline Courses-<br />Planting Plan Short Course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://abundanceacademy.online/p/the...">https://abundanceacademy.online/p/the...</a><br />More Food Less Effort Course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://morefoodlesseffort.com/">http://morefoodlesseffort.com/</a><br />Kitchen Garden Fermentation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://abundanceacademy.online/p/hom...">https://abundanceacademy.online/p/hom...</a><br /><br />Use code PLAN20 for 20% off the Productive Planting Plan Course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://abundanceacademy.online/p/the...">https://abundanceacademy.online/p/the...</a><br /><br />-üîóSocial-<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/HuwRichardsO...">https://www.facebook.com/HuwRichardsO...</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/huwsgarden/">https://www.instagram.com/huwsgarden/</a><br /><br />-üßµClothing-<br />Awesome clothing designed for vegetable gardeners: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://huwrichards.teemill.com/">https://huwrichards.teemill.com/</a><br /><br />-üç¥Delicious Garden Recipes<br />Farmer &amp; Chef <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/farmer.and.chef">https://instagram.com/farmer.and.chef</a><br /><br /><br />#grassclippings #permaculture #jadam<br /><br /> Intro - 0:00<br />Grass clippings are misunderstood - 0:35<br />Drying out grass clippings - 1:30<br />Multiple Mulch Options - 2:16<br />Slugs &amp; Mulch - 2:49<br />Weed Control &amp; Water Retention - 3:15<br />Mulching Potatoes - 3:57<br />Watering - 4:32<br />Longer grass - 5:18<br />JADAM Organic Amendment (JLF) - 5:43<br />JADAM Grass Liquid Fertilizer - 6:46<br />Grass JLF Process - 7:18<br />Using JLF - 10:18<br />Project LEACS - 11:22{% endraw %}
