{% raw %}ESL teachers and students will love this Household Items ESL Vocabulary guessing game. There are 10 household item vocabulary words. Firstly, students will watch a 10 second video clip. Students must watch it carefully and try to remember where household items are. Secondly, a question is displayed with 3 choices. If you are a teacher in front of the class, this is a good time to pause the video. If you are watching for fun you also might want to pause the video to think of your answer.
