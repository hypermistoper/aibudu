{% raw %}Welcome back to Assassin's Creed Unity. Today I'll be showing part of a mission called The Silversmith. Like most missions in Unity you're free to approach however you want, taking different routes sets up different opportunities at different times. I always thought Unity had the best replay value in AC because of this. Let me know if you enjoyed the video, thanks for watching :D<br /><br />Current Channel Members:<br />Katie Hyndes<br />GoofyGotGoofed<br />Segal Steven{% endraw %}
