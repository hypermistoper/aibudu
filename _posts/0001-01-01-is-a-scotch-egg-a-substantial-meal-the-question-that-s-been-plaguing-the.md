Under the Government's guidance, all businesses in this category are only allowed to serve alcoholic drinks with meals.<br /><br />Michael Gove initially disagreed with this, telling LBC he only saw it as a &quot;starter&quot;. <br /><br />The Minister for the Cabinet Office then told ITV it was a substantial meal. <br /><br />The drama continues. <br /><br />Read our live politics blog for all updates, like this, here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/12/01/covid-tier-system-vote-parliament-commons-brexit-news-latest/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/politics/2020/12/01/covid-tier-system-vote-parliament-commons-brexit-news-latest/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to The Telegraph on YouTube ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3idrdLH">https://bit.ly/3idrdLH</a><br /><br />Get the latest headlines: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/</a><br /><br />Telegraph.co.uk and YouTube.com/TelegraphTV are websites of The Telegraph, the UK's best-selling quality daily newspaper providing news and analysis on UK and world events, business, sport, lifestyle and culture.{% endraw %}
