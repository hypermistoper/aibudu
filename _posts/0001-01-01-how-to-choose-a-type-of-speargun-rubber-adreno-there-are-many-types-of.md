{% raw %}There are many types of speargun rubbers, all with different purposes in mind. Adreno's Trevor Ketchion takes us through the different types of powerbands for spearfishing and talks about which rubbers works best in different conditions.<br /><br />The standard USA latex 16mm rubber has a decent internal diamteter hole, standard latex and black UV coating. It has medium stretch with enough reisstance to provide good power. At a medium price, it is a good option for standard spear guns. <br /><br />The Rob Allen 16mm rubber is quite a tight rubber, good for heavy shafts which require extra power. This high punch isn’t as useful in a roller gun which is better suited to a stretchy, smoother style of rubber. <br /><br />The standard latex rubber has plenty of stretch and is very smooth with no UV coating. This requires the rubber to be cut shorter to provide the power needed to propel the shaft through the water and is susceptible to wear from sunlight as it is unprotected by UV coating. <br /><br />The Aimrite pink rubber has become increasingly popular. The smaller internal hole gives extra latex and is protected by a UV coating. It provides slightly more punch than the standard USA latex rubber. <br /><br />The Salvimar acid green rubber is an incredibly stretchy rubber with a smaller internal diameter hole, black latex and 1mm green UV coating. The extra stretch means cutting the rubber to a third of the length of what you usually would to produce sufficient power. This is great for roller guns in the delivery of lighter shafts as it provides a smoother propulsion for shooting smaller fish accurately. <br /><br />The Manisub rubber provides smooth delivery of power to the shaft. The larger internal hole reduces the power however the resistance of the latex is still good, with a 1mm thick UV coating. This rubber is good for any gun as well as roller gun as it doesn’t put excess pressure on the roller. <br /><br />Shop the world's biggest dive store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.spearfishing.com.au">http://www.spearfishing.com.au</a>{% endraw %}
