{% raw %}Stripped down version of Radioactive. Playing the same Fender Fretless P Bass I used on the recording. I realized that a lot of the original sound was just the DI, very little amp. An amazing sounding bass. I threw in some fun elements, and played it more like we played it live, as the original recording was more straight ahead. Enjoy!{% endraw %}
