{% raw %}I don't think I've made it much of a secret how little I know about and care for Tiktok as a whole. But then there's Nogla, the man who lives and breathes TikTok all day long. He saved a bunch of videos to show me (well, to show Terroriser but I'm better) and they were actually hilarious. I was expecting them to be terrible and pretty weird, it's Nogla come on. We both got a good laugh!<br /><br />Twitter -<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/bigjigglypanda">http://www.twitter.com/bigjigglypanda</a><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/bigjiggly">http://instagram.com/bigjiggly</a><br />Merch - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.3blackdot.com/collections/big-jiggly-panda">https://shop.3blackdot.com/collections/big-jiggly-panda</a><br /><br />Friends in the Video - Check Them Out!<br />@Nogla <br /><br />Outro Song - &quot;Gigglebytes&quot; by D1ofAquavibe<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/zyqmZgrZc9w">https://youtu.be/zyqmZgrZc9w</a>{% endraw %}
