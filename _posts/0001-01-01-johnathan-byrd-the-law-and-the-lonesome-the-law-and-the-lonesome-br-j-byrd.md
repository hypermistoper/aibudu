{% raw %}The Law and The Lonesome <br />(J.Byrd/C.Raymond)<br /><br />With the wrath of the law and the lonesome above you<br />And all those who love you behind<br />With a storm in your rearview and darkness before you<br />Where will you fly to this time?<br /><br />Only Jesus will go down the road that you're burning<br />And you should be turning to him<br />But how will you wade and be washed in the water<br />When the river is dirty as sin?<br /><br />How can she take you and make you so lonely?<br />You said she was only a friend<br />Any fool in his pride who has tried to refuse her<br />Can see that you're using again<br /><br />The snow's like a ghost of cocaine on the highway<br />It shifts and plays tricks on your mind<br />The wind is like razors and in only two days<br />You done two hundred thousand white lines<br /><br />You took the wrong way home<br />You took the wrong way home<br /><br />They blasted the bedrock and laid all the blacktop<br />Like a snake round the shoulders of God<br />Christ on his hilltop and the cop at the truck stop<br />Are both only doing their job<br /><br />You've got a double cross to bear now you've lost<br />The last friend that you had to lose<br />He's in the ambulance and you're in the cruiser<br />With a fatal case of the sucker-punch blues<br /><br />You took the wrong way home<br />You took the wrong way home<br />You took the wrong way home<br /><br />With the wrath of the law and the lonesome above you<br />And all those who love you behind{% endraw %}
