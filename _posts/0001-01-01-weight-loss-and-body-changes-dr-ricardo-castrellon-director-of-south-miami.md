{% raw %}Dr. Ricardo Castrellon, Director of South Miami Hospital's Burn Center, explains as people start gaining weight, they are going to get larger fat deposits into the abdominal area and the area of the breasts in a male. A female will also have fat deposits in the extremities, including in the arms, resulting in very large arms and stretching the skin.<br /><br />He points out with weight loss, the patient's excess skin in the abdomen will pass below the waist line and the genitals.{% endraw %}
