{% raw %}#POE #PathOfExile #Archnemesis<br /><br />Welcome to spoiler season!<br /><br />Day 6 brings a somewhat crazy unique, Crystallized Omniscience.<br /><br />This doesn't fit into any existing stat stacking build but could make entirely new ones.<br /><br />Not explicitly mentioned in the video but you should also be aware that having your stats converted to Omniscience will reduce some sources of crit chance and ES (from Int), evasion and accuracy (Dex) and life and melee damage (Str). <br /><br />You might also consider using Supreme Ostentation from a timeless jewel early in progression, although I expect you won't have access to this item until late.<br /><br />Official announcements thread: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3228003">https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3228003</a><br /><br />Want the Wasteland Wings MTX free? If you watch any POE stream (can be mine or someone else's) on Twitch next week during the main spoilers for 3.17 you qualify for them - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3228246">https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3228246</a> has details.<br /><br />Sorry about the camera. It's a lighting issue caused by space constraints, can't fit it until I move house which I'm hoping will be soon-ish.<br /><br />Join as a channel member to get access to perks (this helps fund the channel):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1SoHjGhDqK6h980sYsXjhg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1SoHjGhDqK6h980sYsXjhg/join</a><br /><br />I've started streaming on Twitch! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/sirgog">https://www.twitch.tv/sirgog</a> will take you there.<br /><br />You can buy some POE microtransactions and/or games from my Nexus store, and I'll get a cut.
