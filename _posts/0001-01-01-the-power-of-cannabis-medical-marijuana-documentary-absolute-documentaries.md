{% raw %}Cannabis is one of Canada's most valuable resources. Canada's marijuana industry is worth more than $20 billion a year. Huge profits of marijuana are a magnet for organized crime causing the crime rate to raise. The cannabis industry is now so vast and vital to Canada's national economy that it can no longer be ignored. This absolute documentary explores the growth, production, and sale of cannabis starting in the small border town nestled in the Kootenay Mountains, where draft dodgers planted the first &quot;BC Bud&quot; in the 1960s. <br /><br />Absolute Documentaries brings you the best of entertaining and fascinating documentaries for free.
