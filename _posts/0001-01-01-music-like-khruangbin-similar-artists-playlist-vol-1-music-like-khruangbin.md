The globetrotting Texan trio's sound is rooted in classic soul &amp; RnB and informed by psychedelia, dub and music from around the world - all captured in widescreen and performed with impeccable style.<br /><br />Whereas their 2015 debut album 'The Universe Smiles Upon You' was influenced by 60s and 70s Thai cassettes and compilations of southeast Asian pop, rock and funk, 2018's 'Con Todo El Mundo' hops east over India to take inspiration in similarly underdiscovered funk and soul sounds of the Middle-East, particularly from Iran. Laura Lee explains the album's title: &quot;My grandpa would always ask me 'Como me quieres?' ('how much do you love me'?), and he'd only ever accept one response. 'Con todo el mundo' (With all the world).&quot;<br /><br />Music like Khruangbin | Similar Artists Playlist<br />#khruangbin #similarartists #indie<br /><br />Similar Artists Playlists<br />Indie / Bedroom Pop / lofi / Dreampop / Electronic / Surf Rock<br /><br />Enjoy the uploads?
