{% raw %}In this video, I highlight professional disc golfer Paul Oman, from his recent performance at The Open and Belton. His walk-up and cross-step are slow and smooth, and his standstill throws are also very deliberate and fluid. I've become a fan of his drives off the tee and his throws at all distances, and I believe what he is doing is instructional, and can help both disc golf trainers, and students of the game.<br /><br />Thank you to the Disc Golf Pro Tour and the Disc Golf Network for the footage. And thank you to Paul Oman for his pace and form.<br /><br />Disc Golf Pro Tour<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/discgolfprotour">https://instagram.com/discgolfprotour</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/DiscGolfProTour">https://youtube.com/c/DiscGolfProTour</a><br /><br />Disc Golf Network<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discgolfnetwork.com">https://discgolfnetwork.com</a><br /><br />Paul Oman<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/thetalloman">https://instagram.com/thetalloman</a><br /><br />Footage from these two videos:<br /><br />The Open at Belton | MPO Lead Card | Dickerson, Freeman, Orn, Oman | R2, F9<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEgumw4sMRY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEgumw4sMRY</a><br /><br />The Open at Belton | MPO Lead Card | Dickerson, Freeman, Orn, Oman | R2, B9<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBJno5hrc5Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBJno5hrc5Q</a><br /><br />If you liked this video, please give it a Like.
