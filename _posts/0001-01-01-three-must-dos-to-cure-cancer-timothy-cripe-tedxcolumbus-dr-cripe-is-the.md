{% raw %}Dr. Cripe is the Chief of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology/Blood and Marrow Transplant at Nationwide Children's Hospital, a principal investigator in the Nationwide Children's Hospital Research Institute, and Professor of Pediatrics at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. His insights about cancer come from 25 years of practice as a childhood cancer doctor and scientist. He has learned there is reason for hope, but suggests we need to reconsider what we know about advanced cancer biology to cure it.  This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
