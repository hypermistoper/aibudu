{% raw %}Indonesian director Kamila Andini’s female-focused drama 'Before, Now &amp; Then' will premiere in competition at the 2022 Berlin Film Festival.<br /><br />Happy Salma stars as a woman who loses her first husband, child and home in the conflict but finds a refuge of sorts in a second marriage to a wealthy man with patriarchal values and a penchant for taking mistresses. She finds comfort in a friendship with one of these other women.<br /><br />The director arrives in Berlin after a high-profile 2021 on the international festival circuit with her third feature Yuni. The contemporary coming-of-age tale about a teenage girl was Indonesia’s submission to the best international film category of the 2022 Oscars.{% endraw %}
