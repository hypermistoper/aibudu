{% raw %}A tribute I made for the 2016 All blacks .Three All blacks tests where missed in this video for various<br /> reasons but mainly because the video would have been too long .The third Bledisloe cup test (due to low resolution content ) , the Italian test ( I thought this test was insignificant compared to the Ireland battles and would ruin the flow .The France test  (Low resolution content  ) .The first Ireland test was particularly difficult to get suitable footage due to the American  broadcasters displaying weird camera angles .<br /><br />Music <br />Artist : Two Steps From  Hell <br />Songs : Strength of a thousand men ,Love and loss ,Never back down , Victory .(in that order){% endraw %}
