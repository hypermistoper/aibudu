{% raw %}Senior Director of Operations, Eric Fehr, gives some helpful advice on how to properly let employees go during a mass layoff. It is never going to be a pleasant experience but, there are many ways you can help soften the blow or at least treat them the best possible way during hard times. <br />It is imperative to understand that it isn't the fault of any single employee or any single one department. More than likely, it is a byproduct of poor leadership. Own what is happening and train management to break the news to their direct team themselves. These people connect with their direct manager on a day to day basis and it is important to have them be the ones to let them know whats happening.<br />Lastly, any severance pay or parting packages should be buttoned up and be fully prepared before the lay off occurs. People may not remember their first day at the company but they will more than likely remember their last day.<br /><br />For More Management Tips or Information on Search Solution Group please visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.searchsolutiongroup.com/sales-recruitment-business-development-headhunters/">https://www.searchsolutiongroup.com/sales-recruitment-business-development-headhunters/</a>{% endraw %}
