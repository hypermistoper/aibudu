{% raw %}The seemingly mundane electronics you use every day -- your stove, dishwasher, TV and much more -- have a cumulative effect on the climate, says Best Buy's director of environmental affairs Tim Dunn. He shares how the company is helping people reduce their carbon impact through energy-efficient products, considering the full lifecycle of everything they sell and designing for circularity -- as well as their commitment to get to net-zero by 2040.<br /><br />In the Green is a TED series featuring senior leaders from around the business world sharing important lessons about carbon emissions reduction that can be applied to workplaces everywhere.
