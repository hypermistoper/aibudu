{% raw %}Help us to reach more teachers and students to learn about autism and other important topics in their classrooms! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/sprouts">https://www.patreon.com/sprouts</a>  üê¶<br /><br />When we examine 100 random teenagers, around 1 to 2 will have minds that are atypical in a particular way and could be diagnosed with autism. Autism is not a disease and therefore can not be cured. What we can do, however, is to learn more about it and gain an understanding of it. In this video Timo, a young boy diagnosed with Autism will help us understand how living with a neurodivergent mind can be. <br />#autism #learn #teach #sproutslearning<br /><br />3D AUTISM SIMULATION<br />To get a 3-dimensional glimpse of how an autistic girl experiences her own surprise birthday party check out this link <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/OtwOz1GVkDg.">https://youtu.be/OtwOz1GVkDg.</a><br /><br />DOWNLOAD video without ads and background music ü§´:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sproutsschools.com/video-lessons/">https://sproutsschools.com/video-lessons/</a> <br /><br />SIGN UP to our mailing list and never miss a new video from us üîî:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://eepurl.com/dNU4BQ">http://eepurl.com/dNU4BQ</a> <br /><br />SUPPORT us ‚Äî we are on Patreon! üéÅ<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/sprouts">https://www.patreon.com/sprouts</a> <br /><br />SOURCE and further readings üéì:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sproutsschools.com/autism-spectrum-disorder-at-school/">https://sproutsschools.com/autism-spectrum-disorder-at-school/</a><br /><br />THANK YOU, PATRONS! üôè<br />Many Thanks to our wonderful Patrons (www.patreon.com/sprouts) who support us every month and made this video possible: Nancy Bueffler, Adam G, Raman Srivastava, Karl Luckwald, Daniel Kramer, Marq Short, Ronny Thomas Scripz, Muhammad Humayun, Ginger, Tsungren Yang, Esther Chiang, Badrah, Cedric Wang, Eva Marie Koblin, Broke, Jeffrey Cassianna, Sergei Kukhariev, Andrea Basilio Rava, Petra, Ad√®le D, kritik bhimani, David Markham, Don Bone, John Zhang, Mathis Nu, Julien DUMESNIL and many others.<br /><br />OUR CHANNELS<br />English Channel www.youtube.com/c/SproutsVideos <br />German Channel www.youtube.com/c/SproutsDeutschland <br />Spanish Channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SproutsEspa√±ol">https://www.youtube.com/c/SproutsEspa√±ol</a><br />And many more: www.sproutsschools.com<br /><br />SPROUTS TEAM<br />Script: Jonas Koblin<br />Illustrations: Pascal Gaggelli www.instagram.com/pascal.draws/  <br />Production: Selina Bador<br />Production Assistant: Bianka<br />Male Voice: Matt Abbott<br />Female Voice: Mithril<br />Coloring: Nalin<br />Expert: Cynthia Borja<br />Editing: Peera Lertsukittipongsa<br />Proofreading: Susan<br /><br />MUSIC<br />www.premiumbeats.com<br /><br />LICENCE<br />Creative Commons CC-BY-NC <br />More info here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sproutsschools.com/video-lessons/">https://sproutsschools.com/video-lessons/</a> <br /><br />Chapters:<br />0:00 Introduction<br />0:29 Atypical minds<br />1:00 Autism as a spectrum<br />1:40 Meet Timo<br />2:03 Diagnosis<br />2:22 Timo has atypical perception<br />3:13 Timo is highly sensitive<br />3:51 Timo has a fascination with logic<br />4:21 Timo experiences social disconnection<br />4:58 Therapy and reality<br />5:28 Autism is not a disease<br />5:44 What do you think?<br />6:02 Experience a party like a girl with autism<br />6:23 Our wonderful Patrons!{% endraw %}
