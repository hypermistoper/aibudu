{% raw %}Somewhere on Earth - Bolivia | Free Documentary<br /><br />Somewhere on Earth - Chile: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/CzLYSWGGLmY">https://youtu.be/CzLYSWGGLmY</a><br /><br />Bolivia is the heart of the South American continent, a land of volcanoes and tropical jungles, where the sounds, the aromas and the colors are in harmony with a people descended from the Ancient Incas. With its rugged, dusty hues…. it’s also the land of colorful lakes, in the midst of the Andes mountains.<br /><br />Erwann Guégan, a Frenchman who’s been living in Bolivia for 2 years. In Maipiri, a little village on the edge of the Amazon Basin, Erwann has been working on a project here that he is quite committed to the construction of a landing strip to open up the region and thus allow medical evacuations. For now, there’s no train or plane to access the valleys of the Yungas region, only a steep, twisting road and collective taxis crammed to the limit by their drivers.<br /><br />Photography and archeology are Gabriela Escobar’s two passions in life. She quite naturally brought them together in one vast project: she travels the length and breadth of Bolivia to photograph every archeological site in the country, thus building up an inestimable data base for historians the world over. During her travels, she recaptures the poetry of the books that used to make her dream in her childhood.<br /><br />The brothers Miguel and Diego Morales have set up a little company that organizes paragliding flights and mountain treks. Not long ago Miguel had a serious paragliding accident. When he got out of the hospital it was his brother Diego who encouraged him to start flying again. For Miguel’s comeback flight they gave themselves a challenge: to fly over the Salar de Uyuni, the vast salt flat in the far south west of the country. What is it they’re hoping to share together? Tons of dust, encounters and adventures in the country’s high altitude deserts.<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Subscribe Free Documentary Channel for free: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2YJ4XzQ">https://bit.ly/2YJ4XzQ</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/free.documentary/">https://instagram.com/free.documentary/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG">https://bit.ly/2QfRxbG</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI">https://bit.ly/2QlwRiI</a><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />#FreeDocumentary #Documentary #SomewhereOnEarth<br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br />Free Documentary is dedicated to bringing high-class documentaries to you on YouTube for free.
