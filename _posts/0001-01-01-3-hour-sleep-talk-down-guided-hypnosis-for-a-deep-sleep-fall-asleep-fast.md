{% raw %}Welcome to this 3 Hour Sleep Talk Down Guided Hypnosis for a Deep Sleep.  This new sleep hypnosis meditation is set in the Amazon Rainforest and some of the ideas for this hypnosis was inspired by a trip I took when I went to visit my brother when he was living in Peru, South America.  It begins with a sleep talk down, that will help you relax, let go of the day and unwind into a peaceful slumber and then in a later part of the hypnosis there will be some gentle rain that will continue to go on through the rest of the 3 hours for you to fall asleep to in the background.<br /><br />0:00 Introduction <br />2:30 3 Hour Sleep Talk Down<br /><br />Do you want to support my work even more?  Why not become my patron <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/tansyforrest">https://www.patreon.com/tansyforrest</a> and get patron only updates, discounts on hypnotherapy with me and audio only versions (via my private Patreon Soundcloud playlists) of my most recent YouTube uploads without the introduction and most importantly ad free and much more over time! <br /><br />The Hypnosis Meditation is backed by relaxing meditation music and around 20 minutes into the track the screen will fade to black so you can drift off into a peaceful slumber and fall asleep fast! As always this recording is spoken by my British female voice of Tansy Forrest.  <br /><br />Remember to keep practising hypnosis or guided meditation daily to ensure that positive messages and behaviours can stick with you into the future.<br /><br />My hypnosis &amp; guided meditation channel is aimed at creating the best recordings and inspired by many other popular hypnotherapists like Michael Sealey and Paul McKenna. I hope you enjoy this Guided Sleep Hypnosis Meditation recording by my British female voice.<br /><br />So if you find this video useful please like it and leave and suggestions for future videos in the comments. <br /><br />#3HourSleepHypnosis #SleepHypnosis  #FemaleVoiceHypnosis<br /><br />üëç Like the video (it helps the channel!)<br />üí¨ Comment if you made it till the end!<br />üîó Please share the video with someone you think it might help :)<br /><br />üëç Please remember to SUBSCRIBE to my channel to get notified of WEEKLY UPLOADS - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9vGwH8Fs_pO2eyywCg7XwA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9vGwH8Fs_pO2eyywCg7XwA?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Listen to my most popular female voice hypnosis and meditation sessions üòÄ<br /><br />WEIGHT LOSS Sleep Hypnosis Meditation - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/wXzblm2ER9I">https://youtu.be/wXzblm2ER9I</a><br /><br />Guided Meditation for Sleep &amp; Relaxation Hypnosis - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/XvL3LTLVyF0">https://youtu.be/XvL3LTLVyF0</a><br /><br />Deep Sleep Hypnosis to FALL ASLEEP FAST - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/huP5am9J56E">https://youtu.be/huP5am9J56E</a><br /><br />Hypnosis for Sleep &amp; Healing - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/M6X9MvZDQRQ">https://youtu.be/M6X9MvZDQRQ</a><br /><br />Why not listen to my pre-compiled hypnosis and hypnotherapy playlists below,<br /><br />Hypnosis for Sleep, Deep Sleep &amp; Insomnia Reduction - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrVn_0sOfcKiBnV4DzRIcq8V6P0HP0D5d">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrVn_0sOfcKiBnV4DzRIcq8V6P0HP0D5d</a><br /><br />Hypnosis for Relaxation &amp; Stress Relief - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrVn_0sOfcKiB8mG8ForLLyOhBGWS2i25">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrVn_0sOfcKiB8mG8ForLLyOhBGWS2i25</a><br /><br />Hypnosis for Anxiety Reduction - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrVn_0sOfcKh19uF2kDjAOCZRLL0agqfB">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrVn_0sOfcKh19uF2kDjAOCZRLL0agqfB</a><br /><br />All Hypnosis Sessions Playlist - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oMzs5_vO6A&amp;list=PLrVn_0sOfcKi-Jyo5SObFJrvMfHYBQ5du">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oMzs5_vO6A&amp;list=PLrVn_0sOfcKi-Jyo5SObFJrvMfHYBQ5du</a><br /><br />Want to make your own hypnosis or meditation recordings?
