{% raw %}This clip is from the video vault in my Keep the Blaze Alive Coaching Squad (aka “The Squad”). The Squad has three levels of membership, and we meet weekly online with a 2-hour livestream where I answer questions and tell stories, and the Tier 1 members get two monthly two-hour Zoom calls where we talk face-to-face. I also host two 3-day events per year for my Tier 1 members.
