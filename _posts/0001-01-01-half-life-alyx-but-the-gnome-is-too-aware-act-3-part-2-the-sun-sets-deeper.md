{% raw %}The sun sets deeper as we approach darkest night. But the dark shall be pierced through SONG. As Gordon(?) and Gnome begin to learn more about each other, the gnome's hostility increases. And while Gordon(?) is distracted with sing-a-long's and arguments, he walks right into the den of a new vessel for Gnome's tough love. Welcome, new contestant!<br /><br />-------------<br /><br />On June 1st, 2021, twitch streamer 'wayneradiotv' was linked to a workshop page for a newly uploaded mod for Half-Life: Alyx. A mod that would &quot;breathe life&quot; into Gnome Chompski. He installed it, hoping to make the stream of his &quot;gnome run&quot; more interesting. He was not aware of the myth, but that didn't matter anymore.
