{% raw %}Handling a batch of jugs. The same form you may have seen thrown and trimmed in my previous Reels. These are the easiest part of making these, thankfully, as the throwing the wafer-thin bodies and trimming them is fiddly, often precarious work. The handle on the other hand attaches both top and bottom to portions of the vessel that are spaced away from rim or base, so there’s little collide with or smear clay over. The joins can simply be blended in neatly either side. <br /><br />Once handled, as the bodies were verging on being slightly too dry. I spray them all lightly with water before wrapping them up tightly in plastic sheeting overnight. In the morning all the clay will have all softened down slightly and the handle and body will hopefully be the same texture. Care needs to be taken when doing this of course as if you soak them too much when freshly handled there’s a chance they’ll flop down, so I make sure they’ve all slightly ‘set’ before misting them.<br /><br />Sometimes I’ll leave them under plastic for a few days, just to make sure they’ve acclimatised to each other, as this, more than anything, is what helps prevent cracks from forming around the joins. <br /><br />#shorts<br />___<br /><br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/floriangadsby/">https://www.instagram.com/floriangadsby/</a><br />TikTok – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@floriangadsby">https://www.tiktok.com/@floriangadsby</a><br />Website – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.floriangadsby.com">http://www.floriangadsby.com</a>{% endraw %}
