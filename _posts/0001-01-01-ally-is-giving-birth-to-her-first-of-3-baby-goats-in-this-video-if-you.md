{% raw %}If you ever wanted to know what a goat birth or delivery looks like this video will show you. Ally, our F6 Mini Nubian doe had triplets in 2020. She was a first time Mom and we raised her as a bottle baby. Goats do bleed, some scream, some stand and some lay down while giving birth. You just want to make sure the baby is positioned correctly and Mom is making progress. Some deliveries take minutes and others take 30 minutes. Just like with human births they are all different. <br /><br />Here is baby goat #1 being born at the farm. This was a text book goat delivery with no complications. Yes, we have had to go in and turn baby goats and pull them out when they are stuck. I never catch this on video because we are working quickly to save the baby goat and Moma goat. <br /><br />Ally is a awesome goat mom! She also delivered triplets on March 19th of this year. We came out to find 3 cute little baby goats and Ally was already cleaning them.<br /><br />We do offer Baby Goat Playdates and classes on goats.
