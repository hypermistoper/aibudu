{% raw %}The story of the ascension of Virgin Mary, the Mother of God. <br /><br />Have a blessed joyful feast of Saint Mary, may her prayers before the throne of God be with us. Amen <br /><br />“Come let us wonder at the virgin most pure, wondrous in herself, unique in creation, she gave birth, yet knew no man; her pure soul with wonder was filled, daily her mind gave praise in joy at the twofold wonder; her virginity preserved, her child most dear. Blessed is He who shone forth from her!” - Saint Ephraim the Syrian{% endraw %}
