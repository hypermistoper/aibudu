{% raw %}This is a Giant TCR, it was sent to me by a viewer who wanted a new bottom bracket and suspected a fault with his original Shimano BB.<br /><br />I was expecting this bike to be of reasonable tolerance quality. The bottom bracket was well undersized and not round. Also marginally out of alignment. The fault was so blatant, it is inexplicable how this got through QA.<br /><br />Giant TCR BB86 Necked BB <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hambini.com/product/bb86-to-shimano-racing-edition-black-bottom-bracket-necked/">https://www.hambini.com/product/bb86-to-shimano-racing-edition-black-bottom-bracket-necked/</a><br /><br />Hambini website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hambini.com">https://www.hambini.com</a><br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hambinieng">https://www.instagram.com/hambinieng</a><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Hambini-Engineering-109615891445939">https://www.facebook.com/Hambini-Engineering-109615891445939</a>{% endraw %}
