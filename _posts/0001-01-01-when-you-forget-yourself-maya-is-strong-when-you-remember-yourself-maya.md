You have to be wise to overcome Maya’s voice. When you forget yourself, Maya is strong — when you remember yourself, Maya does not exist.”<br /><br /><br />~<br /><br />18 July 2019<br />Monte Sahaja, Portugal<br /><br />Live music before Satsang: &quot;Improvisation on violin&quot; by Igor Malewicz<br /><br />Live music after Satsang: &quot;From Heaven's All Gracious King&quot; by Shivali, performed by Shivali, Igor Malewicz &amp; Jiří Dosoudil<br /><br />(Lyrics based upon the poem &quot;It Came Upon a Midnight Clear&quot; by Edmund Sears)<br /><br />~<br /><br />This video is the ‘Satsang of the Week’ for 21 July 2019<br />To subscribe or watch this weekly service, please visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.tv/satsang-of-the-week">https://mooji.tv/satsang-of-the-week</a><br /><br />#Mooji #satsang #spirituality #advaita #nonduality #awakening{% endraw %}
