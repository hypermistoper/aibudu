{% raw %}Former Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer says Opposition leader Peter Dutton is a &quot;very gutsy politician&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;I've watched his press conference myself during the course of the morning - I thought it was exceptionally well done and I think he came out with precisely the messages that he should come out with,&quot; Mr Downer told Sky News host Andrew Bolt. <br /><br />Mr Downer said it shouldn't be about the Liberal Party moving to the left or the right but &quot;winning the debate on values&quot; and and &quot;having the guts to take on your opponents&quot;.<br /><br />&quot;I often think a lot of Liberals, they're fearful of getting engaged in debates and being abused.&quot;{% endraw %}
