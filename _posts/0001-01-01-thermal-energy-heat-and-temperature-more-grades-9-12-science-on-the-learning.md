{% raw %}What is the difference between heat, thermal energy and temperature? This program explores the differences between each and explains that temperature indicates how hot or cold a substance is, heat is the transfer of thermal energy from one substance to another and thermal energy relates to the total kinetic energy in a substance. Students will experience examples of each.<br /><br />Thermal energy refers to several distinct thermodynamic quantities, such as the internal energy of a system; heat or sensible heat, which are defined as types of energy transfer (as is work); or for the characteristic energy of a degree of freedom in a thermal system {\displaystyle kT}kT, where {\displaystyle T}T is temperature and {\displaystyle k}k is the Boltzmann constant.{% endraw %}
