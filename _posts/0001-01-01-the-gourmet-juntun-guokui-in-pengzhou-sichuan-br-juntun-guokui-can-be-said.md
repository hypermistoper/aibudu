{% raw %}军屯锅魁可以说是四川的美食名片之一，它的发源地就在彭州市的军乐镇，小镇上的锅魁产业有完整的规模，制饼一条龙服务，很多都是几代人的老店。麻辣香酥的锅魁先煎后烤，外皮金黄满满的肉馅，香酥可口。阿星还搭配了红油肥肠粉来吃，加了两个冒节子特别美味。<br />Juntun Guokui can be said to be one of the gourmet business cards in Sichuan. Its birthplace is in Junle Town, Pengzhou City. The Guokui industry in the town has a complete scale, one-stop service, and many restaurants have done it for several generations. The spicy and crispy Guokui is fried first and then roasted. The skin is golden and full of meat filling, which is crispy and delicious. Axing also served it with red oil Feichang noodle, and it was especially delicious with the addition of two Jiezi.{% endraw %}
