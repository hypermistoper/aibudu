{% raw %}With so much change in the world around us, we all need something to count on. The outdoors are a place most of us turn for peace and rejuvenation. Outdoor pursuits dripping with tradition—like Spey fishing—have become even more sacred and worthy of protection.<br /><br />Now, from issues like global pandemics to global warming, there are countless ways in which this tradition can be broken. In swinging flies for wild steelhead in British Columbia’s famed Bulkley-Skeena Valley, &quot;Leap Year&quot; explores the river and the colorful characters of this culture as it begs the question: who will carry on these traditions if the migrations come to a screeching halt?<br /><br />We're proud to be supporters of this film by @anadromous &amp; @topofilms. Leap Year spent the last 12 months touring in the F3t film festival.<br /><br />#leapyearfilm #steelhead #britishcolumbia #f3t #speyfishing #speycasting #flyfishing #flyfishingfilmtour<br />@flyfishingfilmtour @orvis @fishingbc @nativefishsociety @frontiersteelhead @epicwaters @travelnorthernbc @smithersbrewing @scientificanglers{% endraw %}
