And while a lot of musicians have just decided to settle, give writing credits (and royalties) and be done with it, Katy Perry, Ed Sheeran, and Dua Lipa aren't going to just lay down and hand over some money just because of coincidence! Buckley looks at how these three artists are essentially saving what little creativity is left in the music industry, and why it's not just about pop music.<br /><br />Link to Rick Beato's video about the ongoing Dua Lipa vs Artikal Sound System case: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT3DghWbk2A">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT3DghWbk2A</a> <br /><br />EDIT: April 16, 2022 - Woke up to a fun surprise from the labels today: they had blocked my video because of the &quot;Rosa Parks&quot; clip. Rather than fight it, I decided to just &quot;trim&quot; the clip out, hence the awkward part at 4:35. If you don't know what &quot;Rosa Parks&quot; by Outkast sounds like, I guess go check it on this horrible website somewhere else.<br /><br />#DuaLipa #EdSheeran #KatyPerry{% endraw %}
