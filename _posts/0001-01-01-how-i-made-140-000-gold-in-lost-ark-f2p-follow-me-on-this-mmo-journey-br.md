{% raw %}Follow Me on This MMO Journey:<br />Twitch Live Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/stoopzz_tv">https://www.twitch.tv/stoopzz_tv</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Stoopzz_TV">https://twitter.com/Stoopzz_TV</a><br /><br />In this video, we discuss the importance of upgrading gear in Lost Ark when reaching tier 3 content. I also give some predictions on where the economy is heading and how players can make an insane amount of gold right now using their materials. <br /><br />With the Argos Raid looming, some players have begun pushing their item level in order to reach 1370; however, I personally believe this is a mistake. Although it is just an assumption, I believe a road map will be released and some type off catch up event may occur. This is why I am currently selling all of my materials and plan to buy them back in the future at a much lower price as more players begin to reach Tier 3. Again, this just what I am doing, and you are free to do whatever you want!<br /><br />Zeals Affinity Video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ImKQEYvQpxA">https://youtu.be/ImKQEYvQpxA</a><br /><br />#LostArk #MMORPG #로스트아크<br /><br />0:00 Intro<br />0:35 Gold Making &amp; Inflation<br />2:08 Upgrading Gear<br />3:23 Slowed Progression<br />6:27 Even If I'm Wrong<br />7:21 What You Should Be Doing<br />9:15 If You Are Lost{% endraw %}
