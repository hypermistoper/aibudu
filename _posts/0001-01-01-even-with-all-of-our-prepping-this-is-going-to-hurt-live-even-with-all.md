{% raw %}Even With All Of Our Prepping This Is Going To Hurt | LIVE<br /><br />We know that things could turn for the worst very easily with current conditions and no matter how well prepared we are, challenges are coming.<br /><br /><br /><br />Prepping for times of turmoil like this is the name of the game.
