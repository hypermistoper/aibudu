{% raw %}While we were in Guizhou we had the opportunity to go see Uniwigs' factory! It was a very interesting trip and we loved learning more about the workers lives. They seem very happy and they were so kind to us! I am so grateful to UniWigs for letting us come see and for answering all of our questions about the process. It was a very unique experience for my family and we loved every minute of it! <br /><br />You can learn more about this company at www.uniwigs.com ‚ù§Ô∏è<br /><br />It may seem crazy that we moved our family from the US to China, but we know that after you see our videos you will understand why! China has so many wonderful things to offer and our life here is pretty amazing!
