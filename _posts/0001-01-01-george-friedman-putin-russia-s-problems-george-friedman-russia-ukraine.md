{% raw %}Putin &amp; Russia's Problems - George Friedman Russia Ukraine War Update<br />Thoughts in and around geopolitics.  By: George Friedman<br />In 1972, I was wandering aimlessly around a U.S. Army facility in Pennsylvania.<br />I passed two M-60 armored fighting vehicles – the Army’s longhand for tanks. The sounds they made nearly tore my head off. An NCO, whose rank I couldn’t make out, arrived to complete the job on my head. Thus began my love of tanks.  I have since traveled often to Aberdeen Proving Ground, which had a superb armor museum, including Soviet T-34s and 54s, German Panthers and a Cromwell French AMX. I taught myself about anti-tank weapons. <br />Audio from interview on John Batchelor show.  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://geopoliticalfutures.com/george-friedman-on-the-john-batchelor-show-russian-military-stumbles-in-ukraine/">https://geopoliticalfutures.com/george-friedman-on-the-john-batchelor-show-russian-military-stumbles-in-ukraine/</a><br />Video credit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/LFwydMyMsI4">https://youtu.be/LFwydMyMsI4</a><br /><br /><br />#Google.com<br /><br /><br />For any business enquiry &amp; copyright issue:   bithy723@gmail.com<br /><br /><br /><br />All Footage are collect from videoblocks premium account.<br />License Proof:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZPvL_jZFwGNnn_4n4VmkxPPrMp8NhUkG">https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZPvL_jZFwGNnn_4n4VmkxPPrMp8NhUkG</a><br /><br />some of related channel: CaspianReport , Whatifalthist , Knowledgia , Economics Explained , China Uncensored , The Armchair Historian , America Uncovered , Countryballs Explained , DW Documentary , Futurology , Economics AltSimplified , Economic Raven , Mahanology , Global Economics , VisualPolitik EN , PolyMatter , General Knowledge , Dr. Top 10 , OverSimplified , Jay Foreman , Good Times Bad Times<br /><br />Disclaimer:<br />=========<br />This channel may use some copyrighted materials without specific authorization of the owner but contents used here falls under the “Fair Use”<br />Copyright Disclaimer under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
