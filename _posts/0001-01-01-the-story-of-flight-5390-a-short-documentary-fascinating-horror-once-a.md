{% raw %}Once a year, around the holidays, I want to share the story of a disaster that *didn't* happen - a tragedy that, whether through luck, the bravery of those involved, or simple good planning, was averted. In this story, everyone survives... although it's definitely a close call.<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery. Fascinating Horror is all about in-depth research, respectful storytelling, and learning what we can from the mistakes of the past. You might be surprised to discover just how much of today's world is shaped by long-forgotten disasters from decades gone by.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:40 - Background<br />01:50 - The Incident<br />06:56 - The Investigation<br /><br />Music: &quot;Glass Pond&quot; by Public Memory | &quot;The Plan's Working&quot; by Cooper Cannell<br /><br />► Like, comment and subscribe to keep up with my latest videos<br />► Know of an incident I should cover?
