{% raw %}This is the story of Thessaly. A group of destinations with individual characteristics that together make a single region. Therefore the thread is symbolic: It represents the magic of the entire region, the craft that shapes and gives it life; it shows the journey of this craft through time, carving a unique landscape of mountains and rivers; it inspires and binds; it travels between the destinations and is the vehicle through which each tells its story.  The thread runs through all of these: through rivers and up streams, up mountains and down to the sea, through nature and its produce, and through the people of the region who have harnessed and nurtured this craft. And when all the strands are brought together, they weave a single magical story.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.mythessaly.com/">http://www.mythessaly.com/</a>{% endraw %}
