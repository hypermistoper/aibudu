{% raw %}This guided mindfulness meditation session will focus on self-realization by helping you to become your best self. It is what I call being the boundless. If we open our minds and find self-acceptance. This can bring healing by helping to lower anxiety and stress, and bring a feeling of calm and inner peace.<br /><br />This session is 15 minutes total, with 9 minutes of spoken dialogue followed by 6 minutes of ambient music. You can enjoy this meditation daily, either in the morning, at a break in the day, or before you sleep at night. Let it free your mind - become the boundless! ~~~<br /><br />I strive to create some of the most calming and relaxing online guided meditations on YouTube.
