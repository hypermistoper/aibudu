{% raw %}Bay Bridge (7-4) recorded his fifth consecutive success and first in Pattern company when an impressive winner of the 2022 Coral Brigadier Gerard Stakes (1m 2f) at Sandown Park.<br /><br />The four year old’s trainer Sir Michael Stoute a record-extending 11th victory in the contest, while it was a record-extending seventh win for jockey Ryan Moore.<br /><br />A son of New Bay, Bay Bridge was settled towards the rear of the five-strong field as multiple Group One winner Addeybb made the running. The 6-5 favourite Mostahdaf, who was unbeaten at Sandown Park previously, made smooth headway to take the lead entering the final quarter mile but Bay Bridge made a powerful challenge down the outside to move into pole position a furlong from home. He stayed on strongly inside the final furlong to win by five lengths.<br /><br />Ryan Moore commented: &quot;You would be hopeful he would carry on doing that. I’m very happy with him. He is entitled to (go up to Group One company) as he has beaten some very solid horses there. Hopefully there is plenty to look forward to.<br /><br />“He had a few issues last year, nothing major, he just had to wait but he has improved with every run. I’m happy.”<br /><br />#HorseRacing #Horses #SandownPark #Equine #RyanMoore<br /><br />This is the official YouTube channel of Racing TV.<br /> <br />Racing TV is the UK's leading horse racing channel showing live racing from the best racecourses in Great Britain and Ireland.<br /> <br />Subscribe to Racing TV's free YouTube channel and get closer to the sport we all love.
