{% raw %}In this video I show you situations related to the right of way at stop signs. A lot of new drivers get confused at intersections with stops signs. This video is intended to help everyone understand how make it smooth at such intersections. <br />A stop sign is used to control traffic and is usually found at road intersections. Stop signs instruct drivers about the right of way and ensure proper notice is taken to avoid accidents. Standard stop signs are red octagons with “STOP” printed in white letters. When you see one at any corner or intersection, know that you must stop and proceed only if the way ahead is clear, and after obeying any rules regarding right of way.<br /><br /><br />Checkout Car Accessories: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.ca/shop/torontodrivers">https://www.amazon.ca/shop/torontodrivers</a><br /><br /><br />Click to watch videos in different languages.
