{% raw %}Toby Asai Loftus has assisted his mother with many talks on this subject and has accompanied her on pilgrimages to the Tule Lake and Heart Mountain relocation centers. See more on his resources page here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tobyloftus.wordpress.com/2019/02/20/february-19-day-of-remembrance/">https://tobyloftus.wordpress.com/2019/02/20/february-19-day-of-remembrance/</a><br /><br />Toby’s mother, Mitsuko (Mitzi) Asai, was a fourth grader in Hood River when she and her family were forced to leave their home and sent to guarded “relocation centers,” first in Tule Lake, CA and later in Heart Mountain, WY. The Asais, like more than 120,000 other Japanese people, were rounded up and incarcerated in the barbed wire-enclosed camps during World War II without charge, due process, or conviction for any crime. Their only “crime” was being of Japanese heritage. <br /><br />Mitzi Asai Loftus received a BA from the University of Oregon in 1954, and taught at Creswell High School. She received a Fulbright teacher’s grant to teach English as a foreign language in Shizuoka, Japan. Mitzi is the author of Made in Japan and Settled in Oregon, a memoir of her family's history that includes their experiences during World War II. Mitzi spent 47 years as an educator and raised three sons.<br /><br />The mission of Take PART is to confront racism and to engage in dismantling the systems that perpetuate ingrained racial inequality. We do this through events, education, and outreach that foster engagement in building community where all people are treated with equality and respect.{% endraw %}
