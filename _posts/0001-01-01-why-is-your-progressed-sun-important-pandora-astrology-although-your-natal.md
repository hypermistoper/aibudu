{% raw %}Although your natal chart remains fixed, it also develops over time. This “developmental astrology” is called progressions and one of the most important progressions to watch is your progressed Sun. Because your progressed Sun moves about one degree per year, by the time you’re 30-years old, the Sun will be at the same degree as when you were born, but in the next Sun sign! Your chart’s progressed Sun sheds light on how and when your identity, sense of self, ego and reason-for-being will change and develop as you get older. Join Jamie and Julia for this informative video to learn much more about the meaning of your progressed Sun, as well as how to easily calculate it.<br /><br />Find out how current influences play out in your horoscope: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/pandorahoroscope">http://bit.ly/pandorahoroscope</a><br />For more about this month's planetary activity, check our Monthly Forecast: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/astrologyforecast">http://bit.ly/astrologyforecast</a> <br />Subscribe to our newsletter so you can get the latest video in your inbox weekly: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Jo9G7I">https://bit.ly/2Jo9G7I</a> <br />Want a reading?
