{% raw %}Valentine's Day crafts for your little ones to try at home. We created 6 different types of craft projects. Give us a thumbs up if you liked or tried any of these!<br />Spend the day as a family creating memories and art as a keepsake to show them later (when they are all grown up)<br />Show your love by making a super easy card by pouring colors that kids love the most or hand printing on the cards!<br />Craft activities are for having fun while creating something special so don't stress out on how messy it gets or if it doesn't come out perfect. Kids are still trying to learn so the result might not be the exact way you imagined it to be. Have something wipeable to sit on when using colors/paint as boundaries do not work well with the kids, haha! <br />#craftswithkids #artwithkids #kidvalentine #valentinecrafts #valentinesdaywithfamily #familyof4 #valentineart{% endraw %}
