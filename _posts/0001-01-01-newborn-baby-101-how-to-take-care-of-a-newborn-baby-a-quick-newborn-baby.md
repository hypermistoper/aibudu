{% raw %}A quick newborn baby 101 guide to looking after a newborn. I share how to resolve all the major newborn dilemmas: colic, reflux, gas, eczema, eye infections in newborns, cradle cap and more.<br /><br />Having a newborn baby can feel overwhelming, especially as a first time mom. I've learned a lot between both my babies and I experienced basically everything under the sun in terms of newborn baby issues. It was a lot on myself as a first time mom and I didn't see much from others about the things I was dealing with. I remember thinking, &quot;Why does my baby cry so much? Is this normal?&quot; It felt really isolating. I don't want anyone to go through that, so I'm here to share what I've learned through my experience in hopes that it can help you through any struggles you may be dealing with as first time parents. <br /><br />Time stamps:<br />0:38 EASY method (eat, awake, sleep and you time)<br />1:04 breastfeeding (breastfeeding a newborn)<br />1:35 formula feeding (how to bottle feed)<br />2:10 burping (3 ways to burp a newborn)<br />2:50 Tummy time<br />3:10 Newborn sleep<br />3:48 cradle cap<br />4:33 fingernails (how to deal with them)<br />4:52 eye infections and umbilical stump<br />5:17 eczema<br />5:35 diaper rash<br />5:55 reflux<br />6:19 colic (how to calm a newborn baby)<br />6:48 the calming reflex<br />7:00 swaddling a newborn<br />7:40 gas (how to soothe a gassy baby)<br /><br />If you're new here, welcome to my channel :) <br />My name is Sarah.
