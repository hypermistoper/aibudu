{% raw %}This seller was gifted a problem property that has squatters living inside, it's back in taxes and the seller is VERY MOTIVATED to sell this house.<br /><br />Listen to this call and the questions that John Cochran is asking her. He could have easily booked the appointment 30 seconds into this call, however he kept asking so he can hear the entire story of this seller.<br /><br />Pay extra close to the question that John asks at 7:03 as it's a question that you should be asking all of the sellers that you speak to.{% endraw %}
