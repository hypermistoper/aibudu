{% raw %}08/20/2017 Sunday am Sermon<br /><br />New Here?<br /><br /><br />First of all, welcome!<br /><br />Looking for a church home can be a daunting task – “Do they teach the truth?”  “Will they accept me?”  “Will I grow there?”<br />The church here at South Salem is a spiritual family, and as a family we live to serve one another.  Such service would include such thing as:<br />◾Making available a steady diet of spiritual food from God’s word only. <br />◾Providing a safe environment were we all can worship God in peace and unity<br />◾Accepting people where they are, and then helping them grow into the likeness of Christ.<br />◾Share the gospel of Christ with all who will listen.<br /><br />We would invite you to pick up a Welcome Pack next time you visit us, which will further introduce you to who we are.<br />◾If you have Bible questions, just ask!<br />◾For those who want to learn about the Bible for the first time, or want to know what to do to be saved, we are more than happy to arrange a personal study with you at your convenience.<br />◾Check out the many audio lessons on this website of which you can listen<br />◾If you are interested in joining our fellowship then just let somebody know.<br /><br />No matter what your need or interest, we are here to help.{% endraw %}
