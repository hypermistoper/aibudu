{% raw %}The biggest problem in dividend stocks is the low payouts but not with these seven dividend income investments and an average dividend yield of 14% on the list! Find these stocks and get three free shares worth up $3,000 on Webull ðŸ’° <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mystockmarketbasics.com/webull">https://mystockmarketbasics.com/webull</a><br /><br />In this video, Iâ€™ll reveal seven income investments that yield an average 14%...more than 10-times the average yield on dividend stocks. Iâ€™ll show you options strategies to boost your income, how to set each up and how to invest $10,000 for massive cash flow!<br /><br />One of the biggest problems in dividend stocks is the low payouts. For example, the average dividend yield in the market is just 1.3%, thatâ€™s a dividend of just $13 a year on ever $1000 invested.  Even the supposedly high dividend stocks and funds arenâ€™t that much better, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF pays just 2.8% a year. <br /><br />Everything you need to know about options investing including my five favorite strategies! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/owZNEuYL_N0">https://youtu.be/owZNEuYL_N0</a><br />Want more income funds like the QYLD? Check out the top five income ETFs here! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/3zk_uD8qhiQ">https://youtu.be/3zk_uD8qhiQ</a><br /><br />Even on a $10,000 investment, thatâ€™s just $23 a month in dividends, which is about enough to fill up your gas tank if you drive a scooter. <br /><br />But the seven income investments Iâ€™ll show you next average 14% dividend yields, more than 10-times the market average. A combination of dividend stocks, income investments and options strategies for the highest possible cash flow.<br /> <br />Understand though, getting that â€˜insaneâ€™ cash flow also means accepting more risk. These arenâ€™t like investing in Coca-Cola and never worrying about the money. These are high-yield, high-risk income investments so be ready to hold through the tough times.<br /><br />There's also another point I need to make, that your highest income investments need to be in tax-advantaged retirement accounts. Unless youâ€™re living off those dividends now, you want to invest these into retirement accounts so you donâ€™t have to pay taxes on the cash flow every year. Otherwise, the annual tax on dividends and income is really going to bite into these.<br /><br />ðŸ¤‘  Get The Weekly Bow-Tie - my FREE weekly email newsletter sharing market updates, trends and the most important news!
