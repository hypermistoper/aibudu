{% raw %}Professional chef Saúl Montiel from Cantina Rooftop and home cook Emily are swapping ingredients and hitting the kitchen to make a calzone that nonna would be proud of. We set our home cook Emily up with $196 worth of supplies - everything she’d need to make Saúl’s recipe. Meanwhile, a modest $13 worth of ingredients was sent back the other way for chef Saúl to elevate into something gourmet. As is customary, food scientist Rose dialed in to assist our dear Emily with a few questions he had along the way. Which calzone would make you shout “mangia?”<br /><br /><br /><br />Follow Chef Saúl on Instagram at @chefsaulmontiel and @CantinaRooftop<br /><br />Keep up with Emily on her YouTube channel at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://youtube.com/emilyduncan">http://youtube.com/emilyduncan</a> and on Instagram at @emilyslamduncan<br /><br />Rose is on Instagram at @rosemarytrout_foodscience<br /><br />Still haven’t subscribed to Epicurious on YouTube? ►► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/epiyoutubesub">http://bit.ly/epiyoutubesub</a><br /><br /><br /><br />ABOUT EPICURIOUS<br /><br />Browse thousands of recipes and videos from Bon Appétit, Gourmet, and more.
