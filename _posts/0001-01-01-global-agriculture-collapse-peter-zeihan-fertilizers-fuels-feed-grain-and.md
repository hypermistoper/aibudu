{% raw %}Fertilizers, fuels, feed grain and cheap wheat--we've seen prices across the board jump in recent weeks following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. <br /><br />We know what happened last time Russian wheat exports didn't reach markets in 2008--a series of price spikes that left several vulnerable governments reeling. Across the Arab world, we saw these consequences play out as the Arab Spring. <br /><br />But what happens when food inputs are not only more expensive, but impossible to find? What of the globalized agricultural market, where producers across the global are dependent on imported inputs to grow exported feed grain? Where subsidized bread is made from imported grain? And the transport systems moving everything face rising fuel costs?<br /><br />Russia's abundance of flat, cool-temperate land doesn't provide much in terms of defensible geography. But it is good for growing grain, particularly wheat. Russia's place in global grain markets is also a great example of technology helping a country overcome geographic limitations. Moscow was not blessed with a country boasting an American or German level of navigable riverways, nor are its prime grain producing regions particularly close to any of its ports. <br /><br />Enter rail. <br /><br />Russia is often derided as a gas station masquerading as a country. As I have noted before, this is an oversimplification that belies the significant role Moscow plays in global agricultural markets. Russia and its wheat belt neighbors, particularly Ukraine, are significant agricultural exporters of grains and seed oils. But Russia is also leading global exporter of fertilizers and fertilizer components. Not only do Russian fertilizer exports help support agricultural production in Brazil, China, India and Europe, but they help provide necessary supply in a globalized market that is increasingly seeing farmers' input costs rise.<br /> <br />The breaking of trade relationships, spasms in energy pricing, and most certainly the Ukraine War will limit sharply what is possible in the world of agriculture, and do so more quickly than I have ever feared. Join us March 11 for a seminar on the impact of the Ukraine War on global agriculture. Weâ€™ll dive deep into the product and input disruptions that will shape our world this year, and deep into the future.<br /><br />Watch full interview. . .<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/I3Lo4LqbU08">https://youtu.be/I3Lo4LqbU08</a>{% endraw %}
