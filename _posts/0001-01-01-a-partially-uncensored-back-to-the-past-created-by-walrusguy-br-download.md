See, there was this set of cassette tapes my mother bought for me from the dollar store back in the early 1990s for me to listen to as I was falling asleep. They all had dinosaur-related songs and stories on them, one of which was called &quot;Back to the Past&quot;. I listened to that one a lot. No, I'm not doing anything horrible to my childhood, because I would have found this edit funny as a child, too. AUDIO SOURCES: &quot;Back to the Past&quot; &quot;TANK!&quot; (Cowboy Bebop opening){% endraw %}
