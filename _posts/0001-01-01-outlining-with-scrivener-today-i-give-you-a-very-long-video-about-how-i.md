{% raw %}Today I give you a very long video about how I use Scrivener to help me outline and stay organized while writing. I use a 3 act - 9 block - 27 chapter method to structure my stories and in this video I finally explain it using actual examples from the story I will be writing for Camp NaNoWriMo. (Video about my outline structure here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94F-3Z6CJJw)">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94F-3Z6CJJw)</a><br /><br />ALSO! There will be a liveshow LATER TODAY, FRIDAY, MARCH 15th, at 5:00 PACIFIC. To see the liveshow, just go to my youtube page and it will be broadcasting right there!<br /><br />Also you can follow my twitter. I will tweet a link when it starts! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/kat_tastic">http://www.twitter.com/kat_tastic</a><br /><br />Oh and here's a timezone converter to make your life easier: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/pst-to-gmt-converter">http://www.worldtimebuddy.com/pst-to-gmt-converter</a>{% endraw %}
