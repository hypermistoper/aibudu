NONE OF THE ITEMS FEATURED ON MY CHANNEL SHOULD BE USED OR EXPOSED OUT IN PUBLIC, AND SHOULD ONLY BE USED AT A PROPERLY INSURED GAMEPLAY SITE.  <br /> <br />I love reviewing these products, collecting them, and using them in film production. So to that end, I have merged most of these entities together to create this channel. However, my more professional movie-making ventures are not featured here and remain separate.<br /> <br />I do not have the room/space to do long-range accuracy tests. Until I can secure a larger space, what you see in my videos is all I can offer for now. Sometimes I do have access to an outdoor secure field but it is nowhere near where I am based. Please remember my YouTube channel is my hobby and not a business. ðŸ˜Ž{% endraw %}
