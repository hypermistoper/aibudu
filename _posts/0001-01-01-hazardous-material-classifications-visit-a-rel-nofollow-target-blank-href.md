The Hazard Communication Final Rule (HazCom 2012) is aligned with the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals, or GHS, which provides standard criteria for determining chemical hazards to ensure different manufacturers and importers classify hazards similarly. This module will focus on the hazard classes defined by HazCom 2012.{% endraw %}
