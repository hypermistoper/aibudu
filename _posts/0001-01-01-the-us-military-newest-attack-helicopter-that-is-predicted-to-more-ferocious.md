{% raw %}The us military newest attack helicopter that is predicted to more ferocious than the black hawk.<br /><br />Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky and Boeing have unveiled the final specifications of their new helicopter, one that will replace the US Army's iconic UH-60 Black Hawk. These new helicopters are not only meant to replace the Black Hawk, they fly up to twice as fast and twice as far, giving Army airstrikes unmatched battlefield mobility.<br /><br />#helicopter #blackhawk #usmilitary{% endraw %}
