{% raw %}This video will show you how to properly tension your v-belt. Proper belt tension is the most important step to ensure the performance and life of the belt. If you donâ€™t have enough tension on the belt you will experience slippage, excess heat, premature belt failure, and decreased bearing life. Too much tension causes additional stress on the belts, bearings, and shafts.  Follow these steps to ensure proper belt tensioning and maximize the life of your belts.<br /> <br />For more information on Belt Tensioning, download the Browning Toolbox Technician app or visit regalbeloit.com/browning<br /><br />MCV20064{% endraw %}
