{% raw %}People in our lives care about what we think and how we feel, and in this sermon, Pastor Allen Jackson encourages us to use our influence to uphold the Kingdom of God. To do this, we need to view our lives through a heavenly perspectiveâ€”so we can see what we do well, and where we need to grow, spiritually. It also requires a vision of Jesus that is beyond what we currently understand. Through several prayers, Pastor Allen invites the Spirit of God to help us and equip us so we can take our place as leaders for His Kingdom.<br /><br />Enjoy this message from Pastor Allen Jackson at World Outreach Church in Murfreesboro, TN.<br /><br />Follow Along!<br />Mobile Notes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3PmdWCd">https://bit.ly/3PmdWCd</a><br /><br />Subscribe for more content from Pastor Allen Jackson: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmJ_L35KPnDoIfzbe4sfRQA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmJ_L35KPnDoIfzbe4sfRQA</a>  <br /><br />#pastorallenjackson #worldoutreachchurch <br /><br />Connect with Pastor Allen: <br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.allenjackson.com">http://www.allenjackson.com</a><br />Pastor Allen Jackson Web: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://allenjackson.com">https://allenjackson.com</a> <br />Pastor Allen Jackson Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/pastorallenj...">https://www.facebook.com/pastorallenj...</a><br />Pastor Allen Jackson Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/pastorallen...">https://www.instagram.com/pastorallen...</a>{% endraw %}
