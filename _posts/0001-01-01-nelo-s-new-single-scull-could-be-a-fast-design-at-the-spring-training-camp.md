{% raw %}At the spring training camp Vienna I had the chance to meet Pete Spivey, who happens to be the Austrian rep for Nelo rowing boats.<br /><br />I knew that Nelo is a big company and I knew that they were about to make their mark in rowing. In this video, I go through some of the remarkable features of this 75kg Nelo single scull.<br /><br />For disclosure: As of this date, I am not associated with Nelo in anyway. I just like their design. <br /><br />The rowing and kayak videos were filmed playing from youtube, and are available here: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Jqvum3L2k">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67Jqvum3L2k</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5-_L_Z0llk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5-_L_Z0llk</a><br /><br />my personal website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.aramtraining.com">https://www.aramtraining.com</a>{% endraw %}
