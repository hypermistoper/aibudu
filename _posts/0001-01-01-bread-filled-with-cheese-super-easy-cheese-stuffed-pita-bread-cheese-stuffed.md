If you have a baking stone, put it in the lower rack of oven to heat. If you don’t have a baking stone, place an oven safe large baking sheet on the lower rack to heat (five minutes prior to baking).<br />When ready to bake, gently lift a pita disc, with your fingers or a large spatula, and flip it onto the hot baking stone (if your stone is large enough you can bake more than one at a time). <br />Flip the dough so that the side that was resting on the counter is now facing up. You want the the side that has been exposed to air (the dry side) to be down on the baking stone and the side that is more doughy and moist to be facing up – this helps the pita puff up. If you bake one or two and they aren’t puffing, spritz the top of the pita round with a light mist of water before baking. <br />Baking Temperature and Duration<br />Bake at 450 F for 3-4 minutes. The bread should all puff up in the initial 3-4 minutes of baking. If not, bake for another minute. If at 5 minutes the bread still doesn’t puff up, your oven is probably not hot enough and you may want to increase the temperature to 500 Fahrenheit for the next batch.<br />When the pita breads are all puffed up, transfer the baking sheet to the middle rack or a higher rack (a little more closer to the heating coils) and bake for another 1-2 minutes, or until the bread turns golden brown.If we don’t take the pita bread to the upper rack,then the pita bread  won’t get browned and the longer they stay in the bottom rack,the pita bread get harder.<br />Remove the baked cheese stuffed bread and wrap with a kitchen towel to keep them soft.
