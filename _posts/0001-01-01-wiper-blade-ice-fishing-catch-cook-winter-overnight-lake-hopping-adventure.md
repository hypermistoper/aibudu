{% raw %}Greg hops from lake to lake, drilling holes in the ice and dropping lines, but it's COLD AND WINDY, so he parks his vehicle on the ice and decides to fish with his windshield wiper!<br /><br />Greg is a self-taught survivalist from Canal Flats, British Colombia, who, since he was a boy, has read nearly every book on the topic. When he is not out in the wilderness, he is a professional dry-waller. He started his first bow drill fire when he was thirteen and spent the next forty years learning bushcraft and studying plants and edibles. He has even developed some of his own survival techniques and is a skilled hunter with both a bow and a slingshot.<br /><br />JOIN this channel and become a member to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4jxd-47X7mnekLfxbsAuew/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4jxd-47X7mnekLfxbsAuew/join</a><br /><br />Greg's Online Store!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fowlersmakeryandmischief.com/greg-ovens">https://www.fowlersmakeryandmischief.com/greg-ovens</a><br />&quot;The Go-To Place to Get Greg's Gear&quot;<br /><br />Greg's Amazon Store!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/fowlersmakeryandmischief?listId=1W0X1AI7B5NXQ&amp;ref=idea_share_inf">https://www.amazon.com/shop/fowlersmakeryandmischief?listId=1W0X1AI7B5NXQ&amp;ref=idea_share_inf</a><br /><br />Greg's 30 Day Survival Challenge - Canadian Rockies:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5nqERH-2iVoEqFS4BfJRyOS2Xg11r4QU">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5nqERH-2iVoEqFS4BfJRyOS2Xg11r4QU</a><br /><br />Fowler's 30 Day Survival Challenge - Canadian Rockies:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjSScLBAtGMgXbxPJ_cm95Md6Cl8vCTPR">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjSScLBAtGMgXbxPJ_cm95Md6Cl8vCTPR</a><br /><br />Be Sure to Subscribe, Hit the Bell, and Turn on Notifications!<br /><br />Thanks For Watching,<br />Ovens Rocky Mountain Bushcraft<br /><br />Ovens Rocky Mountain Bushcraft is Produced by Fowler's Makery And Mischief<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/FowlersMakeryandMischief">https://www.youtube.com/c/FowlersMakeryandMischief</a><br /><br />#bushcraft<br />#gregovens<br />#ovensrockymountainbushcraft{% endraw %}
