{% raw %}‼️ DO NOT CUT/TRIM/REUPLOAD ‼️<br /><br />Edit: As you guys can see, I changed the name of this video as I am aware of the issues, I am apologizing for not even thinking of what people would think about Haechan and me as a fan calling him 'brat'. I just wanna say that I never meant it in a bad way, even when he's mad he's just too adorable for me maybe that's why I labeled it as 'brat'. But I realized that I don't want other people to take it differently especially the antis, I don't want him to be sterotyped as that 'brat' in nct. I hope you forgive me. I will try not to do the same mistake again.<br /><br />Alot of you are asking where's the first clip from. Here's the EP1: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.vlive.tv/video/163938">https://www.vlive.tv/video/163938</a> just click the channel, all the episodes are there.<br /><br /><br />what haechan wants haechan gets LMAO <br /><br /><br />have you guys seen the Ridin' MV?
