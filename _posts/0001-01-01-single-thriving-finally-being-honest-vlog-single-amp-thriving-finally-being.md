{% raw %}Single &amp; Thriving! Finally Being Honest Vlog<br /><br />Hey everyone, welcome back to my channel!<br /><br />For the first video of 2022, I wanted to kickstart it by doing a vlog with a few major life updates... 2021 wasn't the best year for me and I took quite a bit of time away from YouTube and wanted to explain why. BUT I'm back and better than ever woooo. In this vlog, I talk about my breakup, moving out alone, self-love, turning 24, and do a little McDonalds order...<br /><br />If you are new to my channel, don't forget to subscribe so that you can watch more videos from me!
