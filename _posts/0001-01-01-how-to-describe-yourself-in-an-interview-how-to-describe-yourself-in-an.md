{% raw %}HOW TO DESCRIBE YOURSELF IN AN INTERVIEW by Richard McMunn of:<br />#InterviewSkills #InterviewPreparation #InterviewQuestionsAndAnswers<br />In this video, I will teach you how to describe yourself in an interview. How you describe yourself at the start of your job interview is going to be the difference between a pass or a fail. If you don’t get your interview off to a flying start, you are unlikely to pass!<br /><br />PLEASE SUBSCRIBE TO MY CHANNEL AND GIVE THE VIDEO A LIKE (Thank you!)<br /><br />I WILL COVER THE FOLLOWING 3 THINGS DURING THIS JOB INTERVIEW TRAINING TUTORIAL<br />#1. I will explain why the interviewer is asking you to describe yourself and, more importantly, what they want to hear in your response.<br />#2. I will tell you the 5 most important words you should use when describing yourself in an interview that are guaranteed to impress the hiring manager.<br />#3. I will give you 3 brilliant example scripts you can use to describe yourself positively during your interview that will make you the stand-out candidate!<br /><br />WHY IS THE INTERVIEWER IS ASKING YOU TO DESCRIBE YOURSELF, AND WHAT DO THEY WANT TO HEAR IN YOUR ANSWER? 01:44<br />The interviewer will ask you one of the following 3 questions right at the start of your job interview:<br /><br />Q. Tell me about yourself.<br />Q. Introduce yourself.<br />Q. How would you describe yourself?<br /><br />Whichever question they ask you, this is where you need to describe yourself in a way that sets the rest of the interview up in a positive manner. If you don’t describe yourself in a way that the interviewer finds appealing, you will quickly lose confidence, and the interview could go down downhill rapidly.<br /><br />THE INTERVIEWER IS ASKING YOU TO DESCRIBE YOURSELF FOR 2 REASONS:<br />REASON #1. When you describe yourself in an interview, it gives you the chance to talk about something you should know really well, and that is yourself! It allows you to get into the flow of the interview, it breaks the ice, and it helps you to create a positive first impression.<br /><br />REASON #2. Is because the interviewer wants to quickly assess whether or not your skills, traits, and attributes are going to be a fit for their team and the role you have applied for.<br /><br />So, if the interviewer thinks you can ADD VALUE to their company, they will definitely be interested in hiring you.<br /><br />However, if the manner in which you describe yourself at the start of your interview is weak, and it is not aligned to their company values, or what they are looking for, the interview could be cut short!<br /><br />WHAT ARE THE 5 MOST IMPORTANT WORDS YOU SHOULD USE WHEN DESCRIBING YOURSELF IN AN INTERVIEW THAT ARE GUARANTEED TO IMPRESS THE HIRING MANAGER? 03:27<br /><br />LET ME NOW GIVE YOU 3 BRILLIANT EXAMPLE SCRIPTS YOU CAN USE TO DESCRIBE YOURSELF DURING YOUR INTERVIEW THAT WILL IMPRESS THE HIRING MANAGER!<br /><br />HOW TO DESCRIBE YOURSELF IN AN INTERVIEW SCRIPT #1 06:17<br /><br />HOW TO DESCRIBE YOURSELF IN AN INTERVIEW SCRIPT #2 07:14<br /><br />HOW TO DESCRIBE YOURSELF IN AN INTERVIEW SCRIPT #3 08:00<br /><br />MORE GREAT JOB INTERVIEW TRAINING VIDEOS BY RICHARD MCMUNN ON YOUTUBE TO HELP YOU PASS YOUR INTERVIEW:<br />How to introduce yourself in an interview: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/wexzvClUcUk">https://youtu.be/wexzvClUcUk</a><br />What's your biggest weakness: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/UX_dxcjp5Gw">https://youtu.be/UX_dxcjp5Gw</a><br />17 Advanced Words for job interviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/NcoDmHt5RmI">https://youtu.be/NcoDmHt5RmI</a><br />Interview Questions and Answers: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/KCm6JVtoRdo">https://youtu.be/KCm6JVtoRdo</a><br />21 QUICK ANSWERS to Interview Questions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/fr-mwiyhZAo">https://youtu.be/fr-mwiyhZAo</a><br /><br />CONNECT WITH RICHARD MCMUNN ON LINKEDIN.COM:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-mcmunn-coach/">https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-mcmunn-coach/</a><br /><br />DOWNLOAD MY TOP 30 ANSWERS TO INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://passmyinterview.com/top-30-interview-questions-answers/">https://passmyinterview.com/top-30-interview-questions-answers/</a>{% endraw %}
