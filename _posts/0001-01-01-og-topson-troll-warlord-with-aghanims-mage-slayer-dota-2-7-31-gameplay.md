His Berserker's Rage gives him the unique ability to change his attack position from ranged to melee and back at will as the situation warrants. When in close combat, his stats are increased accordingly: he gains bonus armor, movement speed, reduced base attack time, and the ability to root. Not only does this greatly improve the Troll Warlord, but allows him to overpower most other carries, as well as permanently ensnare a target for extended amounts of time. The Troll Warlord is an axe specialist, using them in his unique Whirling Axes, which has two variations: the first is available to his ranged form wherein he throws axes in a cone formation to damage and slow enemies. The second is available to his melee form, whirling axes around himself in a small radius to damage and blind nearby enemies. In keeping with his savage nature, Fervor builds up the Warlord's momentum, granting him attack speed with each consecutive hit on the same target, though the momentum is lost upon switching targets. His Ultimate, Battle Trance, increases his attack speed further, boosts his movement speed, prevents death and grants lifesteal at the expense of almost complete loss of control when enemies are nearby, mindlessly attacking them. Notorious for his superbly fast attack speed that can be matched by few, Jah'rakal is truly a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />www.dotabuff.com/matches/6450200211<br /><br />Learn about Dota 2:<br />According to wikipedia.org, &quot;Dota 2 is a multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video game developed and published by Valve. The game is a sequel to Defense of the Ancients (DotA), which was a community-created mod for Blizzard Entertainment's Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion pack, The Frozen Throne. Dota 2 is played in matches between two teams of five players, with each team occupying and defending their own separate base on the map. Each of the ten players independently controls a powerful character, known as a &quot;hero&quot;, who all have unique abilities and differing styles of play. During a match, players collect experience points and items for their heroes to successfully defeat the opposing team's heroes in player versus player combat. A team wins by being the first to destroy the other team's &quot;Ancient&quot;, a large structure located within their base.&quot;{% endraw %}
