{% raw %}I received a call asking for help with the case of Fufy, a street dog.<br />People thought she was pregnant, but I was sure that Fufy was not pregnant and she needed to be rescued immediately.<br />She was so heavy and annoying that she could not finding the food like a normal street dog.<br />She could barely move, that's why she was hungry on the street.<br />Life as a street dog was not easy.<br />This was an emergency and we were rushing to the vet with her!<br />At the vet vet, Fufy was given x-rays, blood samples, and fluid analysis.<br />Until then, about 10 liters of liquid had been drained from her stomach.<br />Her bones were starting to show up, and there was a lot of pain and discomfort as the fluid was released.<br />And she seemed to peacefully fall asleep.<br />She would finally sleep well after months of pain and suffering<br />Fufy’s update, here was her right after all the liquid was drained.<br />Veterinarians were still studying her case and would be conducting further tests soon.<br />She ate like never before, as soon as the pain and discomfort were gone.<br />Fufy  is our brave girl<br />She went on a special diet with supplements and tonics to help regain her strength.<br />We stayed with her constantly and made sure she was comfortable.<br />And I want to tell you: “Be kind to the animals around you”{% endraw %}
