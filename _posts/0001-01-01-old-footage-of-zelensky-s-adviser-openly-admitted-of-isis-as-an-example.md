{% raw %}A few years ago, an adviser to Zelensky's office openly admired ISIS and cited them as an example of &quot;wise strategists.&quot; In addition, Arestovich argued that ISIS is a &quot;network structure from the future.&quot; <br /><br />Could this explain the behavior of Ukrainian Soldiers shooting unarmed Russian PoWs. It's unclear as to yet if the adviser continues to stand by this view of his appraisal of ISIS.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://t.me/esotericbalt">https://t.me/esotericbalt</a> my personal account{% endraw %}
