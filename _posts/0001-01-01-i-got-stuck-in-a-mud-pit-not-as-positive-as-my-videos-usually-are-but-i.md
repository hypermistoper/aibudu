{% raw %}Not as positive as my videos usually are, but I hope you understand! After a long time of no creativity and energy, I suddenly finished two videos. This is one, where I try to explain how I've been feeling lately. Next video is a documentary I made about my dad! It will hopefully be followed by a livestream with him as well.<br /><br /><br /><br />MY PATREON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/miriamfollin">http://www.patreon.com/miriamfollin</a><br />SUPPORT ME THROUGH PAYPAL: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.paypal.me/miriaminchina">http://www.paypal.me/miriaminchina</a><br />WHERE I GET MY MUSIC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://share.epidemicsound.com/miriaminchina">http://share.epidemicsound.com/miriaminchina</a><br />THE VPN I USE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.xvinlink.com?a_fid=miriaminchina">https://www.xvinlink.com?a_fid=miriaminchina</a><br />MY GEAR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/miriaminchina">https://www.amazon.com/shop/miriaminchina</a><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/miriaminchina">http://www.instagram.com/miriaminchina</a><br /><br />Some of the links above are affiliate links, which means that if you click through my links and decide to make a purchase, I will receive a small commission at no extra cost to you.<br /><br />› THE MUSIC I USE<br />Since early 2018 all the music in my videos come from Epidemic Sound - the perfect music library for video makers.

I’m a Swedish woman who has been living and traveling in China since 2015. 2017 I married and began living with my husband in his hometown in north western China. On this channel I share videos on life, culture and food in rural Qinghai, and sometimes little videos from other parts of China or from Sweden.<br /><br />› THANK YOU FOR WATCHING!{% endraw %}
