After that, there was a 42% drop…followed by another 1 months of a bull market going back up 30%.<br /><br />So, just given this context...even though, on average, bull markets do LAST LONGER than bear markets…history has shown us that volatility is EXTREMELY COMMON, and seeing drops or gains of 20% in either direction isn’t as extreme as you would think. <br /><br />It’s also shown that &quot;Half of the S&amp;P 500 Index’s strongest days in the last 20 years occurred during a bear market. Another 34% of the market’s best days took place in the first two months of a bull market—before it was clear a bull market had begun.” <br /><br />The fact is, if you buy consistently, on a regular basis, regardless of where the market is trading, with the intention of holding for at least 10-20 years…historically…you would have NEVER LOST MONEY…yeah, seriously…if you just buy a set amount, on auto-pilot, without panicking and timing the market…you’ll typically make more money, AND faster, than anyone else with a different strategy. <br /><br />&quot;All I’m getting at is, in each of these market crashes, it could be argued that “this time is different” - and, indeed, it IS different. No two bear markets are ever going to be the same, and once we run out of UNKNOWNS for what will happen in the markets - I believe stocks will begin to recover. No idea how long that’ll take, BUT…I have a feeling we’ll be able to look back at THIS, and see it as one of the best buying opportunities out there.&quot;*<br /><br />*That’s what I said at the LOWEST POINT OF THE MARKET ON March 20th, 2020…and THAT is what I believe, today. That’s certainly NOT to say it can’t drop even more, and hey…it might…BUT, for anyone who has ever commented or wished that they could’ve invested in early 2020…well, in a way, now is your chance.<br /><br />As Warren Buffet says: “The stock market is a device for transferring money from the impatient to the patient.”<br /><br />My ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB">https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB</a><br /><br />Creator Properties - This communication does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy an interest in any fund or investment vehicle.
