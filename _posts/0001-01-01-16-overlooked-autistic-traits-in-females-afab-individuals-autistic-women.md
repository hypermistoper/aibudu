This was after YEARS of therapy (and all of the self tests in the world!). My diagnosis has brought up questions, frustration, doubt, but most importantly, a new level of self compassion and understanding.<br /><br />I'm here to share knowledge, resources, and products that empower other neurodivergents (and their loved ones) to live freely and creatively. I'm not a doctor so please speak with your healthcare providers before implementing any recommendations I make on my channel.<br /><br />Women are under-diagnosed due to lack of research. Please share any videos that are helpful to you so we can spread awareness and acceptance.<br /><br />Music by Milky Wayvers (&quot;Mountain&quot;)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/freetousemusic/milky-wayvers-mountain">https://soundcloud.com/freetousemusic/milky-wayvers-mountain</a><br /><br />#autism #autistic #aspergers{% endraw %}
