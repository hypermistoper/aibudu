The coniferous forest soon appeared before my eyes, I followed the old snow-covered path to the familiar aquarium. disappeared in an instant. There was no fish here anymore, I threw the rod aside and lit a fire for myself. The wind blew the fire up and then went out. Finally the wood caught on fire, burning with the scent of wood. The warmth spread, even the heart felt very cozy. There was a hole in the fire in the ice, the cold water smoked with the dying fire. If you saw the scene then you would probably feel it. how magical they are.
