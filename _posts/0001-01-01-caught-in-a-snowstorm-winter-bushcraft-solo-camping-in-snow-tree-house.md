{% raw %}CAUGHT IN A SNOWSTORM - winter bushcraft, solo camping in snow, tree house.<br />I made a hike to the wild forest to stay overnight in a Russian winter wilderness, and luckily I found an abandoned bushcraft tree house. <br />The temperature was minus 8 Celcium in the daytime, and minus 12  at nighttime, and there was enormous amount of snow in the forest. <br />I've decided to recover this shelter to stay overnight in winter wood. First I made a ladder, using the rope. Unfortunately, my sow broke. Luckily, I had my old Soviet axe with me. I cleared the shelter from the snow. Than I found  a fallen spruce tree, to use it's branches as a bed. The height of this shelter would allow me too stay warm at night. <br />This time I took a special syberian musical instrument, called &quot;Vargan&quot;. I played on it a bit. The ancient syberian pagan shamans used it for their actions. <br />  Later the snow storm suddenly began. Luckily I've put a  tent as a, roof for then shelter, so I was prepared for enormous amount of snow. It was difficult to find dry wood for fire. I made a fire with birch bark, dry spruce branches a nd a bark, which I had to dig out of snow, I cooked some delicious meal, melting a snow to boil the water. This time I took a sleeping robe.  It was a nice winter adventure. <br />ASMR video, sounds of snowy forest and bonfire, that will help you sleep instantly. <br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />#bushcraft #solocamping #overnight #shelter #winterovernight #wintercamp #buildshelter #soloovernight #adventure #outdoors #camp #alone #solo #forestcamp #forestshelter #vadiminthewild #almazankitchen #lonewolf{% endraw %}
