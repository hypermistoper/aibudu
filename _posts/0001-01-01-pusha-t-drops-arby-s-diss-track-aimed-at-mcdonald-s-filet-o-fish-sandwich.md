{% raw %}Pusha T has partnered with Arby’s on a diss track promoting its Spicy Fish Sandwich, poking fun at McDonald’s, home to a competing seafood meal, the Filet-O-Fish. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Pusha T said, “I am solely responsible for the ‘I’m Lovin’ It’ swag and the jingle of that company. I did it at a very young age at a very young time in my career where I wasn’t asking for as much money and ownership. It’s something that’s always dug at me later in life like, ‘Damnit, I was a part of this and I should have more stake.’” <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fox5ny.com/news/rapper-pusha-t-arbys-mcdonalds-diss-track">https://www.fox5ny.com/news/rapper-pusha-t-arbys-mcdonalds-diss-track</a><br /><br />Troi Torain aka STAR is a multimedia personality whose career has spanned the arenas of radio, television and the world-wide web.
