It's the lifeblood of modern day Celtic people everywhere and the influences from our Celtic past, which are still carried in each one of us as part of whom we are and where we come from. Voices, quoted above, is a collaboration between Celtic Thunder Musical Director/Composer David Munro and world-renowned song writer Brendan Graham, who also wrote the international hit &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot;.<br /><br />The set of Mythology is big; it's dramatic and imposing. The new and the old combine. Modern catalyst images are projected onto ancient monolithic standing stones, a giant Celtic cross takes center stage and the tempo of the music is strongly echoed in the theatrical and moody lighting.<br /><br />Celtic Thunder Mythology - 'Turning Away'<br /><br />In darkness we do what we can<br />In daylight we're oblivion<br />Our hearts so raw and clear<br />Are turning away, turning away from here<br /><br />On the water we have walked<br />Like the fearless child<br />What was fastened we've unlocked<br />Revealing wondrous wild<br />And in search of confirmation<br />We have jumped into the fire<br />And scrambled with our burning feet<br />Through uncontrolled desire<br /><br />In darkness we do what we can<br />In daylight we're oblivion<br />Our hearts so raw and clear<br />Are turning away, turning away from here<br /><br />There's a well upon the hill<br />From our ancient past<br />Where an age is standing<br />Still holding strong and fast<br />And there's those that try to tame it<br />And to carve it into stone<br />Ah but words cannot extinguish it<br />However hard they're thrown<br /><br />In darkness we do what we can<br />In daylight we're oblivion<br />Our hearts so raw and clear<br />Are turning away, turning away from here<br /><br />By Loch Etive they have worked<br />With their highland dreams<br />By Kilcrennan they have nourished<br />In the mountain streams.<br />And in searching for acceptance<br />They had given it away<br />Only the children of their children know<br />The price they had to pay<br /><br />In darkness we do what we can<br />In daylight we're oblivion<br />Our hearts so raw and clear<br />Are turning away, turning away from here{% endraw %}
