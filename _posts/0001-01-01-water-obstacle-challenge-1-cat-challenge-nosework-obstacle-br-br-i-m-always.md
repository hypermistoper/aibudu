{% raw %}#Cat #Challenge #Nosework #Obstacle<br /><br />I‚Äôm always coming up with fun games, such as nosework (scent detection) for my cats to help them stay mentally and physically active. This in turn keeps them healthy and prevents or slows the development of issues such as cognitive dysfunction system (feline senile dementia) that inhibit their ability to lead happy lives.<br /><br />These games also help my cats express themselves, and you can see a wide range of emotions on their faces, from wonder and awe to determination and apprehension! I hope my cats will help you realize that cats don‚Äôt have to be grumpy, sleepy, or wide-eyed all the time - they can be so much more!<br /><br />Of course, I always prioritize my cats‚Äô safety when playing with them, and you should too! Here at Kittisaurus, we support the healthy lifestyle of cats for a better future!<br /><br />* Join the Kitty Pirates! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3gv2piU">https://bit.ly/3gv2piU</a><br />* Kittisaurus T-Shirt üëï <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3fw8daO">https://amzn.to/3fw8daO</a><br />A portion of the proceeds from the sale of Kittisaurus goods are used to support cats around the world.<br />* Please forward all partnership inquiries to we@luvcat.com.{% endraw %}
