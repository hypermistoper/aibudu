{% raw %}lyrics:<br /><br />Here I am waiting<br />I'll have to leave soon<br />Why am I holding on?<br />We knew this day would come<br />We knew it all along<br />How did it come so fast?<br /><br />This is our last night but it's late<br />And I'm trying not to sleep<br />'Cause I know, when I wake, I will have to slip away<br /><br />And when the daylight comes I'll have to go<br />But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close<br />'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own<br />But tonight I need to hold you so close<br /><br />Here I am staring<br />At your perfection<br />In my arms, so beautiful<br />The sky is getting bright,<br />The stars are burning out<br />Somebody slow it down<br /><br />This is way too hard, 'cause I know<br />When the sun comes up I will leave<br />This is my last glance that will soon be a memory<br /><br />And when the daylight comes I'll have to go<br />But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close<br />'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own<br />But tonight I need to hold you so close<br /><br />I never want it to stop<br />Because I don't wanna start all over<br />Start all over<br />I was afraid of the dark<br />But now it's all that I want<br />All that I want, all that I want<br /><br />And when the daylight comes I'll have to go<br />But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close<br />'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own<br />But tonight I need to hold you so close<br /><br />And when the daylight comes I'll have to go<br />But tonight I'm gonna hold you so close<br />'Cause in the daylight we'll be on our own<br />But tonight I need to hold you so close{% endraw %}
