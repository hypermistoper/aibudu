{% raw %}LER #187    This is the 3rd video in a new series looking at common components and circuits, from the perspective of a repair hobbyist / technician. <br /><br />All you need to know about INDUCTORS to fix stuff.<br /><br />In each video I hope to teach you all you need to know about the most common way in which components and circuits fail, and how to test and diagnose these faults.  I try to keep each video to around 30 mins or less. Of course I will still be making the regular repair videos this channel is getting well known for.<br /><br />Learn Electronics Repair is now on Discord!
