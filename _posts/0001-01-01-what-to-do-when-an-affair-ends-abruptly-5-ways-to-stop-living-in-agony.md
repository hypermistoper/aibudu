{% raw %}If you were involved in an affair and it suddenly ended, we know you are feeling a whirlwind of emotions. It feels like you're being torn apart and thinking, &quot;that's it. No one will ever love me like that again.&quot; It hurts when the people we love leave us, especially when it comes out of nowhere. <br /><br />It's even more painful if you've given up the most critical parts of your life to be with this person. Your marriage, your family, or your friends, all because you never felt a love that strongly before. You believed you would spend the rest of your life with this person, and the love would stay alive forever because no one understood you the way they did. No one made you feel as whole as they did. <br /><br />Get our FREE Mini Course &quot;How To Get Your Spouse To Fall Back In Love With You&quot;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://marriagehelper.com/how-to-get-your-spouse-back-mini-course/">https://marriagehelper.com/how-to-get-your-spouse-back-mini-course/</a><br /><br />There are no magic words to say to win back their affections, but there are ways to heal when an affair ends abruptly.
