{% raw %}get to know me and my story about my illnesses and various medical problems i've faced over the years....the short version. No matter what you're personally struggling with, rather it's mentally, physically, or both; please never doubt that you are loved and worth the fight. Everybody has a unique story and unique challenges they're faced with and no mental or physical struggles make you less of a person than everyone else. For those who have illnesses similar or the same as ehlers danlos syndrome, complex regional pain syndrome, chronic depression, etc: your pain is not in your head, you're not crazy, your feelings are valid, and it can get better. There's always going to be bad days every once in awhile but the good thing is they are eventually followed by amazing days. Don't let the bad outweigh the good, try your best to always stay positive and find something you're passionate about in life to enjoy. I apologize for not getting further in detail in this video about my medical issues and how i live with them, I just wanted to get this summary up and posted. <br /><br />MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.studio71us.com/collections/taylor-nicole-dean/">https://shop.studio71us.com/collections/taylor-nicole-dean/</a> <br />vlog channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPs9eqGz7drHrgI5pKBIMGg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPs9eqGz7drHrgI5pKBIMGg</a><br /><br />medical ailments mentioned:<br />-celiac disease<br />-ehlers danlos syndrome<br />-complex regional pain syndrome<br />-clinical depression and anxiety disorder <br /><br />thank you so much for the 600,000 subscribers, thanks for believing in me and enjoying my content i put out there. it means the world to have such a lovely community of friends on here.
