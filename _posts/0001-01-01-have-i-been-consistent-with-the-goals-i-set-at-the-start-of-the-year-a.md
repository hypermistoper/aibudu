{% raw %}Every year we all make resolutions on things we want to change and new goals we would like to reach. In this video, I show you how I try to be consistent and more intentional about the goals I set in the beginning of the year. I hope it inspires you to be consistent on whatever goals or plans you made at the start of this year. <br /><br /><br />BANANA SMOOTHIE<br />2 whole bananas<br />1/2 cup of almond milk<br />1 table spoon of peanut butter<br />1/2 cup of rolled oats (if you like)<br />blend &amp; enjoy <br /><br />MAKEUP BRUSHES <br />CVL BEAUTY BRUSHES<br /><br />C O N N E C T W I T H  M E :<br />instagram : @mathildaakatugba<br />snapchat : mathiee_x<br />twitter : @mathildakatugba <br /><br /><br /><br />B U S I N E S S üìß<br />For business inquires please contact <br />mathildabsn.ma@gmail.com<br /><br />Locations üìç<br />Max Mart <br />Vine Accra<br />University of Ghana : Kingdom Bookstore<br />Viannis Bistro <br /><br />Books <br />We Should All Be Feminists - Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie <br />Americanah - Chimamanda Ngozie Adichie<br /><br />V E R S E O F T H E W E E K‚ú®<br />Romans 6:16{% endraw %}
