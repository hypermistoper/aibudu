{% raw %}Here are 8 signs you are a Heyoka, the most powerful empath! Yes, there are different types of empaths, and the Heyoka (known as the sacred clown) is the most powerful one. The Heyoka empath is a contrarian, jester, and satirist who sees the world differently and goes against convention. These highly empathic people tend to react to situations surprisingly and unexpectedly and often use humor as a tool to get their message across.<br /><br />What's more, Heyoka empaths can mirror or reflect people's true personalities and traits back to them, allowing them to really see the person they are. Their conversations tend to result in you giving people advice, and people often feel inspired to change their lives after talking to them.<br /><br />If you suspect that you're an empath, but if you're unsure of the type, watch this video to learn more about the sacred clown personality and if you might be a Heyoka yourself!<br /><br /><br />OTHER VIDEOS TO WATCH:<br /><br />7 Traits Of A Dark Empath â€“ The Most Dangerous Personality Type:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZyI88KOP4Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZyI88KOP4Q</a><br /><br />11 Struggles Only Genuine Empaths Will Understand:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKQelZCYjtg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wKQelZCYjtg</a><br /><br />15 Things Highly Intuitive People Do Differently:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4TTzY1um9s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4TTzY1um9s</a><br /><br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Subscribe To Our Channel for More Videos Like This!<br /><br />TWITTER: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/brainydose">http://www.twitter.com/brainydose</a><br /><br />FACEBOOK:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/brainydose">http://www.facebook.com/brainydose</a><br /><br />INSTAGRAM: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/brainydose">http://www.instagram.com/brainydose</a><br /><br />Audio &amp; Video Production by Brainy Dose<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------{% endraw %}
