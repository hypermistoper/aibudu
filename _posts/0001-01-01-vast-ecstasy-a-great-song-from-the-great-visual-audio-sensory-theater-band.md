{% raw %}A great song from the great Visual Audio Sensory Theater band from Seattle, off of their double album Turquoise &amp; Crimson! I\ve didn't found any decent video of this song on YT with any reference on the band so that's the reason why I did that job. I am NOT owning any rights on music and the video, all rights goes to their original creators. Enjoy awesome music!<br /><br />Lyrics:<br /><br />Addicted to poison<br />The poison is the cure sometimes<br />I have a secret<br />A secret written in the sky<br />I need to go down slow<br />I need to get up to the stars<br />I have a secret<br /><br />Baby baby baby, you're like ecstasy<br />Maybe maybe maybe that's because I am on it<br />Baby baby baby (baby baby baby)<br />I'm gonna take some innocence from you (ooh)<br /><br />Addicted to poison<br />The poison is the cure sometimes<br />I have a secret<br />A secret written in the sky<br />I need to go down slow<br />I need to get up to the stars<br />I have a secret<br /><br />Baby baby baby, you're like ecstasy<br />Maybe maybe maybe that's because I am on it<br />Baby baby baby (baby baby baby)<br />I'm gonna take some innocence from you (ooh){% endraw %}
