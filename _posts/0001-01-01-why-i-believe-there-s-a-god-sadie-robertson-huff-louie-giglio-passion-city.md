{% raw %}Passion City Church pastor Louie Giglio joins Sadie to look at the awe and wonder of God's creation and why you don't ever have to choose between God and science. They also talk about their shared love for the latest season of &quot;American Idol,&quot; what it means to truly know God, why social media steers us wrong about hard work, and why science will never undermine God. Louie also marvels at the miracles it took for a striking letter to reach Sadie. “At The Table with Jesus” and “Indescribable: 100 More Devotions about God and Science” are available now.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://magicspoon.com/WHOA">https://magicspoon.com/WHOA</a> — Get $5 off right now with code WHOA!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://athleticgreens.com/whoa">https://athleticgreens.com/whoa</a> — Get a FREE 1-year supply of Vitamin D &amp; 5 FREE travel packs with your first purchase!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://helixsleep.com/sadie">https://helixsleep.com/sadie</a> — Get up to $200 OFF AND 2 free pillows!<br /><br />Get More Encouraging Videos Each Week by Subscribing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl2vodgsQPqVhbZNGNyjUiQ?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCl2vodgsQPqVhbZNGNyjUiQ?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://liveoriginal.com">https://liveoriginal.com</a><br />Follow: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/legitsadierob">https://www.instagram.com/legitsadierob</a><br />Like: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/sadiecrobertson/">https://www.facebook.com/sadiecrobertson/</a><br />Tweet: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/sadierob">https://twitter.com/sadierob</a><br />Join: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://eepurl.com/cYQOvf">http://eepurl.com/cYQOvf</a><br /><br /><br />ABOUT SADIE ROBERTSON:<br />Sadie Robertson, first introduced to the world as a star of A&amp;E’s Duck Dynasty and ABC’s Dancing with the Stars, recognized she could be a positive voice to those in need of an inspiring presence in their lives.
