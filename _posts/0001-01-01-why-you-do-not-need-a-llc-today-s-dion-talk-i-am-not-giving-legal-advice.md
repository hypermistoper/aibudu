Dion Talk is a channel that helps people understand how to reach financial freedom with rental properties. House hacking can be used in the strategy but isn't required. It just speeds the process up. <br />Passive income is a game changer. Buying cash flowing assets creates an income snowball. As the snowball grows you will be able to invest faster and faster. Before too long you can make work optional. Let me show you how to retire early.<br /><br />What strategy do you use? House hacking? Wholesaling? Flipping? Buy and hold? Long term rental? Short term rental? Local or at a distance? Real estate or stocks? Own a business?{% endraw %}
