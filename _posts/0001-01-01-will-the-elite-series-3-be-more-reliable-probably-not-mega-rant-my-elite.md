{% raw %}My Elite Series 2 Review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAfnUOpvrow&amp;t">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAfnUOpvrow&amp;t</a><br /><br />Todays video is a very vulgar rant, just like the old days of the channel. Although this one has a little more forethought. The Series 3 isn't out yet and likely won't be until, at the earliest, late 2022. But I thought I'd share some thoughts that I've had floating around for a while, specifically thoughts on reliability and the public perception of elite controllers. If you have any thoughts of your own on the topic, be sure to leave them down in the comments below.
