{% raw %}I finished this editing in less than 3h because I got inspired pretty fast. Every scene between them screamed this song. <br /><br />Honestly, I haven't been invested in a drama since Vincenzo because most of them looks the same but this one has the #NormalPeople vibes. This story speaks the 21 century and I'm so happy that Corea is opening their minds to explore sexuality and LGBTQIA+.<br /><br />The only thing that left me frustrated was the fact they didn't explored Jae Eon back story. We don't know much about him. That's too basic for me. I'm hopeful for a second season, I feel there's much more to tell us. <br /><br />Despite most people, I like Jae Eon. He lives his life as he wants. Na-Bin isn't the kind of a one night stand girl but she still agreed with a friends benefits situation. He told her since beginning that wasn't looking for a oficial relationship. But well... They did fall for each other. <br /><br />This is officially one of my favorites dramas in history. In case you know others like this please leave a comment. I'd love watching.<br /><br />✘ INFO<br />COLORING: @goldxnoir <br />SONG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl8fV1jUQPs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jl8fV1jUQPs</a><br />FANDOM: Nevertheless<br /><br />♔ Where can i find you, Thata?<br /><br />Backup&amp;Previews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5O8u3q3grXfVEmg4l2zvLg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5O8u3q3grXfVEmg4l2zvLg</a><br />Twitter: <br />PT-BR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/MsScodders">https://twitter.com/MsScodders</a><br />ENG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/thaiscollywogs">https://twitter.com/thaiscollywogs</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thaiscollywogs">https://www.facebook.com/thaiscollywogs</a><br /><br />#fanvidfeed #drama #dorama #kdrama{% endraw %}
