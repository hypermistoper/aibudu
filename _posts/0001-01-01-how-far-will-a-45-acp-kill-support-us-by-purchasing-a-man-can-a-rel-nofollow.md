We were only able to connect at long range with the 230gr Federal American Eagle FMJ loads on the pine board. We did fire a very limited number of the 230gr Federal HST loading at our Clear Ballistics Torso with no success. We will revisit the subject of expansion and penetration at range in a future video.
