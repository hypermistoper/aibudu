{% raw %}Headphone Users Beware!!!! amazing audio !!!!<br />Here we go again.....Holy cow what an amazing experience. <br />  My daughter came in to tell me there was a massive honey bee swarm flying around in the back yard.  I went out to check on things and saw the cloud of bees flying and wondered if they would land nearby so I could capture them or were they just passing through.     I never expected to find what happened next.  They went straight to some old boxes I had in storage.  Once they started landing it made sense. Bees go to where bees have been and the smell of the empty boxes is a no brainer.     But could I capture the queen before she went in? I almost did.   I had her right in my hand but couldn't hold her to show y'all.  But that didn't scare me.  She went back airborne and I knew she would be back.  All her daughters would guide her to where she needed to be.  And just like itbwas supposed to be, I found her on the side of the box and watched her walk right in.  <br />   I hope you enjoy the video and the experience of being in a swarm of bees from the comfort of that side of the screen.  <br />  Please do not try this at home without the supervision of a knowledgeable bee keeper to walk you through it.   Bees can be dangerous if not handled with respect and protection worn.{% endraw %}
