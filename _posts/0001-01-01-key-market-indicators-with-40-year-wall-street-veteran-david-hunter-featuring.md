{% raw %}Featuring: David Hunter, Contrarian Macro Strategist w/40 + Years on Wall Street<br /><br />David and I get after it with discussion on the Fed, interest rates, inflation, and what this all means to equities, bonds, commodities and crypto. He discusses his thoughts on an upcoming tremendous bull run and then a short but horrific bear market soon after (including his timelines) and what you can do to profit and hedge. We also discuss our mutual belief on a very bleak 2030â€™s and where there may possibly be no place to hide. But there is always a ray of hope! <br /><br /><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />00:00 Intro<br />01:20 Start of the interview<br />01:27 What's the best investment advice you have ever heard?<br />02:25 Are interest rates heading back to 1% or above 3% percent?<br />07:25 What happens if there is a crash in March?<br />10:51 Do you think the Fed needs an excuse not to raise rates? <br />12:54 How long will this bull run last?
