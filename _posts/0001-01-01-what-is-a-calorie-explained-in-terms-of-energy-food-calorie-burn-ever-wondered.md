{% raw %}Ever wondered what a calorie is as a unit of measure? We look at the chemistry behind the energy value of calories and how this relates to the calorie value of food and energy burn.<br /><br />If you’re focusing on diet and weight loss, it’s important to understand the concept of calorie surplus and deficit. In this mini documentary, we look at how much energy you’ll find in a kilocalorie and how this relates to food and drinks we commonly consume.  We also explain the imperial side of things, as the kilocalorie is a metric unit of measure.<br /><br />Be sure to check out my documentary explaining the differences in lifestyle between the 1950s and today, and how we’ve hit an obesity epidemic, despite less calories being consumed today than back then: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9nzjiTQk9DQ">https://youtu.be/9nzjiTQk9DQ</a><br /><br />Become a Patron of my channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/warrennash">https://www.patreon.com/warrennash</a><br /><br />Remember to subscribe to my channel for more easy cooking videos, recipe guides, vlogs and collaborations from my kitchen in the UK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=fitbritsgb">http://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=fitbritsgb</a>{% endraw %}
