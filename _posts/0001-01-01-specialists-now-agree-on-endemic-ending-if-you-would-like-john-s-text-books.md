Got the infection last Tuesday. <br /><br />Tested on Wednesday and was positive. It is what you described but the sore throat is terrible, you don’t realise how often you swallow until it’s torture to do so, <br /><br />been taking my D3 and zinc<br /><br />and if nothing else my new Granddaughter will get to know her Granddad <br /><br />Mis en place <br />When I woke up &amp; feeling like I had a hangover, I immediately took my temperature, sure enough 38.7°c. <br /><br />Knew I had it, just needed confirmation. Performed a lateral flow test &amp; bang! had a positive result in under 5 minutes. <br /><br />No really outstanding symptoms. No sore throat, no real headache (just the tightness of the head - hangover), temperature fluctuated hour to hour, <br /><br />taste bud's altered - no loss, just altered. Basically a general feeling of being unwell. <br /><br />This lasted about 30 hrs &amp; has improved greatly over a relatively short period. <br /><br />It's now day 4 &amp; feeling pretty good. Taste is still altered &amp; a little phlegm but otherwise doing well &amp; just waiting out the isolation protocol.{% endraw %}
