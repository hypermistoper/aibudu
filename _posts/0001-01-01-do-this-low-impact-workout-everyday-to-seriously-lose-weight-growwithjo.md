{% raw %}This 4 Mile workout is sure to get you melting! It’s just the right amount of challenging and we have fun while completing the 4 miles!  While the workout is sweaty and intense, all the moves are low impact and standing! Each exercise challenges multiple muscles in your body and when we rest, we will actually be in a stationary walk. <br /><br />*please note that if you are already doing a daily workout to lose weight, you do not have to add this one to it. This workout is great to mix things up if you are already in a routine*<br /><br />All of these exercises can be done in a small space and you don’t even have to jump the entire time (your neighbors will thank-you)! <br /><br />If you feel as though you are a bit heavier in the feet, try moving your movement to being less in the heel thumping and more in the light toe tapping. This will help you a lot and you will develop more balance and stability.<br /><br />Calories Burned: 570<br />Apple Watch Setting: Indoor Walk<br />Intensity Level: 9/10<br /><br />0:00 Workout Overview<br />1:28 Warm Up<br />5:29 Full Body Workout<br />27:10 Water Break<br />28:29 Full Body Workout Round 2<br />48:29 Calorie Killer Burnout<br />50:17 growwithjo workouts, app, &amp; community<br /><br /><br />If any of the exercises are a bit too fast or you’re struggling with coordination, just slow it down or go back to the walk. This will help you keep your heart rate up, which means you are working on your cardiovascular endurance, which is great for normalizing your blood pressure, and increasing your heart health!<br /><br />We can lose weight, increase our health and enjoy a healthy lifestyle by simply moving our bodies and eating whole foods that nourish our bodies and make us feel our best!<br /><br />That doesnt mean that we have to deprive ourselves of things we love or give up our favorite foods, it means that we learn moderation and how to make healthy treats that fuel your goals! This journey isnt a quick fix, its a lifelong practice of taking care of yourself and giving your body what it needs to thrive!<br /><br />If you stick with me on this journey, you wont regret it! <br /><br />Subscribe for more fun videos to get you smiling and loving working out again:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZUUZFex6AaIU4QTopFudYA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZUUZFex6AaIU4QTopFudYA</a><br /><br />Lets also become friends on IG, follow me!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/growwithjo/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/growwithjo/?hl=en</a><br /><br />If you’re looking for a community of ladies who are motivating, supportive and understanding, join our growwithjo unified private facebook group (its free!): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/710497716384627/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/710497716384627/</a><br /><br /> WARM UP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67eD2Y1lqO0&amp;t=237s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67eD2Y1lqO0&amp;t=237s</a><br /><br />KEEP DANCING WITH ME: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG9XM5PzrT1eUy_R9xkiVfs9GNvwNS3Xz">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG9XM5PzrT1eUy_R9xkiVfs9GNvwNS3Xz</a><br /><br />COOL DOWN: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4MHzjnSayc&amp;t=193s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4MHzjnSayc&amp;t=193s</a><br />________________________________________________________________<br /><br />RESULTS<br /><br />SHARE YOUR WORKOUT VIDEOS on Tik Tok, YouTube or Instagram for a chance to be featured in my next video or on our community Youtube: @growwithjo unified<br /><br />Record a video or take a picture of you doing the workout, tag me @growwithjo #growwithjo @growwithjo_unified<br /><br />To get the BEST (AND QUICKER) RESULTS, follow a nutrition plan that supports your goals.
