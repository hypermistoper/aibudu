{% raw %}A truly excellent boneless skinless chicken breast! <br /><br />Despite their enduring popularity, boneless, skinless chicken breasts can be very disappointing.<br /> People love that they're lean, but that’s exactly what makes them so bland and dry. But when they’re good, they are powerful change agents. Cooking them <br />almost all the way through on one side will result in a chewy crust and superlative browning, and<br /> prevents the chicken from overcooking. If you go a tiny bit over, the bright and juicy tomato pan sauce <br />will camouflage your mistakes.<br /><br />Grab your copy of That Sounds So Good!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/625166/that-sounds-so-good-by-carla-lalli-music/">https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/625166/that-sounds-so-good-by-carla-lalli-music/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to my podcast, Borderline Salty (with Rick Martinez!!)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/borderline-salty/id1616563525">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/borderline-salty/id1616563525</a><br /><br />Thank you to my Patreon community, who fully funded the cost of this video.
