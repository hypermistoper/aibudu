{% raw %}Matrix Mixers have been around for a long time and are a staple in installation sound, yet not often used in music production. A pity, since they offer amazing flexibility in routing that can be used to easily create exciting effect chains. Matrix Mixers also make it easy to create feedback patches, a technique used by many experimental musicians. In this video I show how they work on the example of the Erica Synths Matrix Mixer. They send me the unit, but they had no input on the video. <br /><br />SUPPORT THE CHANNEL &amp; SOUNDPACKS:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/hainbach">http://patreon.com/hainbach</a><br />CHANNEL MEMBERSHIP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeovElJP0n0i8ADaPsRSd8g/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeovElJP0n0i8ADaPsRSd8g/join</a><br />MY MUSIC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://hainbach.bandcamp.com">http://hainbach.bandcamp.com</a><br />FASHION: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://teespring.com/de/stores/hainbach">http://teespring.com/de/stores/hainbach</a><br />CONNECT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://reddit.com/r/hainbach">http://reddit.com/r/hainbach</a><br /><br />MY SIGNATURE SOFTWARE: <br />NOISES <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.audiothing.net/instruments/noises/">https://www.audiothing.net/instruments/noises/</a><br />GONG AMP <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.audiothing.net/effects/gong-amp/">https://www.audiothing.net/effects/gong-amp/</a><br />WIRES  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.audiothing.net/effects/wires/">https://www.audiothing.net/effects/wires/</a><br />MORPHING ROTOR <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.audiothing.net/effects/things-motor/">https://www.audiothing.net/effects/things-motor/</a><br />MELLOTRON <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gforcesoftware.com/products/hainbach-artist-pack/">https://www.gforcesoftware.com/products/hainbach-artist-pack/</a><br />TEST EQUIPMENT LIBRARY <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/hainbach-landfill-totems">https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/hainbach-landfill-totems</a><br />LOOPER <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gauss-field-looper/id1530684073">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gauss-field-looper/id1530684073</a><br /><br />BUY THE GEAR I USE (EU):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://redir.love/thocf/n2lm9oo2ym">https://redir.love/thocf/n2lm9oo2ym</a><br />BUY THE GEAR I USE (US):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3nsnE9Q">https://bit.ly/3nsnE9Q</a><br />(affiliate links, I get a few % if you buy through them)<br />BUY THE GEAR I USE (UK)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tidd.ly/36bwS5b">https://tidd.ly/36bwS5b</a>{% endraw %}
