(FOX 2) - A troubling video has struck a nerve amongst African Americans in the Plymouth Canton community.<br /><br />The recording appears to show a white high school student threatening to shoot and lynch African-Americans---while calling them a number of racial slurs.<br /><br />Plymouth Canton Community Schools Superintendent Monica Merritt addressed the video during a board meeting and in a letter to parents and students Monday night, saying, &quot;We do not condone or tolerate reprehensible acts of this nature.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;I am not able to give details, there is not an active threat I will say, at our school at this moment,&quot; Merritt said Tuesday night.<br /><br />Students say the video first surfaced in early March ‚Äî and later was reshared on social media.<br /><br />&quot;I can‚Äôt even tell you in the past few days since this video has been released how many times I have been called the n-word,&quot; said student Andy Gusway to the school board. &quot;When we don‚Äôt have swift action after these events, this spreads even further.&quot;<br /><br />Students and parents gave the school board an earful at Tuesday night‚Äôs meeting. Many asked if the student from the video in question was disciplined and how Black students are supposed to feel safe at school.&quot;<br /><br />*** <br /><br />Indisputable, features Dr. Richey talking about the top news stories of the day, reading viewer comments, and engaging in debates and conversations with guests.<br /><br />Help support our mission and get perks.
