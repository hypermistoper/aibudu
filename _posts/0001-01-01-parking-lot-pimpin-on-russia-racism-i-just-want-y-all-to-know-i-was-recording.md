{% raw %}I just want y’all to know I was recording in the rain for y’all today. Tried to ouch through but ending having to breakdown and set up set TWICE.<br /><br />This one was a lot. Had to take y’all back to world history today. It’s super important we remain in the know about world events and how they can affect us. <br /><br />Prayers up for Ukraine for sure🙏🏾.<br /><br />Also, your girl has ANNOUNCEMENTS today 💥 Make sure you stay tuned in to the end to hear it. 😉{% endraw %}
