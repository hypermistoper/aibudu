{% raw %}The Russian military has begun the transfer of combat aircraft to the border with Norway.<br /><br />The appearance on the territory of Norway of American strategic bombers B-1B Lancer forced Russia to retaliate and place additional reconnaissance and combat aircraft near its northern borders.<br /><br />According to the &quot;Telegram&quot; -channel &quot;Notes of a Hunter&quot;, a Russian A-50 early warning and control aircraft was deployed to the Murmansk area the day before. The plane arrived at the Olenya airbase, while, according to a number of unconfirmed reports, Russian military aviation is additionally located here, while it is possible that the A-50 aircraft will be involved in the upcoming flight of Russian strategic aviation.<br />â€œRussia is taking preventive measures in connection with the future transfer of American B-1B bombers to Norway and is sending an A-50 AWACS aircraft from Ivanovo to the northern Olenya airfield near Murmansk. As usual, such visits are followed by flights of strategic bombers of the Aerospace Forces. It will be interesting, will the flights be carried out from Engels or will a group of strategists be transferred to Olenya? &quot;- said in the message.<br /><br />It should be noted that experts associate the appearance of American strategic bombers in Norway with Washington's earlier statement of its readiness to take control of the Arctic, including those regions of the Arctic that Russia considers to be under its sovereignty.{% endraw %}
