{% raw %}The 2 stock symbols I'll be using are: TQQQ &amp; SQQQ.<br /><br />My advice is that a person does some PAPER TRADING with these two symbols before they actually use them with real money in their investment trading account. (Hint: Like a YEAR minimum).<br /><br />For instance, give yourself $100,000 of Worthless Coin to &quot;play&quot; with.  Use your &quot;pretend play money&quot; to play both symbols at the appropriate time.  Keep a log of your trades.<br /><br />TQQQ is the trading symbol to use if you think the NASDAQ is going to go UP.<br />SQQQ is the trading symbol to use if you think the NASDAQ is going to go DOWN.<br /><br />REMEMBER:  There is no such thing as a &quot;bad market&quot; using these two investing ETF's.  You can make money when the NASDAQ is going up, or when it is going down.  The KEY is to be on the RIGHT SIDE of the trade, naturally.  Which is WHY you'll want to do some thorough paper trading to test you skill at trying to determine which way the NASDAQ is going to go at any given time frame when trading is happening.<br /><br />Paper trading removes the emotions while learning your investing skills.  FEAR is the deadly emotion you'll mostly deal with starting out.  FEAR OF LOSING once you've invested.<br /><br />The &quot;investing gurus&quot; will tell you that greed is as deadly as fear.  BOTH emotions successful investors need to be aware of, and seek to conquer.<br /><br />Though this might be splitting hairs, I believe PRESUMPTION can be just as deadly as FEAR and GREED.{% endraw %}
