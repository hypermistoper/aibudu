What to Expect creator Heidi Murkoff recently sat down with Dr. Fatimah Dawood, a pediatrician and epidemiologist in the Influenza Division at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to discuss some of the most common questions about the flu vaccine during pregnancy, including whether it’s safe, what side effects you might experience and how the vaccine protects your developing baby. <br /><br />Here are some highlights from their conversation:<br /><br />On whether the flu vaccine is safe for pregnant women: “Flu vaccines are effective. They work really well and they're also safe for pregnant people — that's really important to know. These vaccines have now been given to millions of people in the United States over a lot of years. There’s a lot of data supporting the safety of flu vaccines, particularly during pregnancy. This is something that the CDC continues to monitor every year as well.”<br /><br />On when pregnant women can receive the flu vaccine: “Pregnant people can receive vaccines during any trimester of pregnancy. The key thing really is to get vaccinated as early in the season as possible. Ideally, you should go out and get your flu vaccine, so that you're protected when flu viruses begin to circulate in the community. November is still a great time to go out and get your vaccine. Sometimes we see flu viruses as late as into the spring months, so the earlier the better.”<br /><br />On whether breastfeeding moms should get the vaccine: “If you didn't happen to get a vaccine during your pregnancy, it's important to get one in that postpartum period — especially if you’re breastfeeding. Not only to protect yourself, but to protect your loved ones and protect your baby. By getting vaccinated, you're decreasing the likelihood that you'll get influenza.”{% endraw %}
