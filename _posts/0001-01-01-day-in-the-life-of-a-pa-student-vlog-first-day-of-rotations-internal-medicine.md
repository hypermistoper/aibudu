{% raw %}NSU PA Student VLOG #1 <br /><br />In this video, I will be showing you guys what to expect in PA school during clinical rotations. My first rotation is Internal Medicine, with a focus in Cardiology. I hope to show you guys what a “Day in the Life of a PA student” looks like. <br /><br />This video was shot on my first day of clinical rotations. I show y’all my morning routine, what is in my bag, my responsibilities and what to expect for the first day of clinical rotations as a PA student. I hope this video may help any pre-PAs and any current PA students entering into their clinical year… <br /><br />PA SCHOOL LIFE <br />Physician assistant LIFE<br />Clinical rotations<br /><br />Song: LAKEY INSPIRED - Chill Day (Vlog No Copyright Music)<br />Music provided by Vlog No Copyright Music.<br />Video Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/vtHGESuQ22s">https://youtu.be/vtHGESuQ22s</a><br /><br />&quot;Ehrling - Chasing Palm Trees [Tropical House]&quot; is free to use on the Internet.<br />Music provided by BreakingCopyright: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/I8DsJYYYHjU">https://youtu.be/I8DsJYYYHjU</a>{% endraw %}
