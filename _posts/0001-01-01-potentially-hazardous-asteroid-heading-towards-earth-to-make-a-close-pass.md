It is also classified as a near-Earth asteroid, based on its relative closest distance of 4.9 million kilometers when passing by Earth.<br /><br />NASA is keeping close eye on this giant asteroid that is just over a month away from a close approach to Earth.<br /><br />Nasa has also put the asteroid on its Earth Close Approaches list.<br /><br />According to NASA, asteroids with more than 460 feet in size with orbits within 4.6 million miles of the Earth’s orbit around the sun are categorized as Potentially hazardous asteroids or PHA.<br /><br />NASA have included this asteroid within the listing of asteroids passing very near Earth.<br /><br />An asteroid of this size could do some really serious damage but the big relief is it’s not expected to hit Earth. As NASA said, that the asteroid 2001 CB21 is likely to shoot past us on March 4.<br /><br />While it will be close to Earth, it will safely pass from an estimated distance of 3 million miles away.<br /><br />Space agencies regularly track more than 30,000 known asteroids as they orbit the Sun, and occasionally cross Earth's orbit.<br /><br />NASA already clarified that we have nothing to worry about as far as these asteroids are concerned. In fact, at least for the next hundred years, there is no large space rock on a collision course with Earth.<br /><br />if you really like our video feel free to support us with a thumbs up and also don't forget to subscribe our channel Spacebytes and look forward to the videos that will be waiting for you in the future.<br /><br />CREDIT : NASA/JPL-TECH/ESA/APL/ESO{% endraw %}
