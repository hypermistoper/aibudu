reliable service.<br /><br /><br />Acrylic pouring Medium: Fluid art <br />My home made pouring medium used for my usual work is a pre mix of 70%  clear craft glue and 30% warm water, if in the USA Elmer’s glue all works well (most pva glues can be made up with same ratios to make a pouring medium), I add my pouring medium to my paint slowly until I achieve the consistency of pouring cream, approximately 50/50 more pm if needed, not all paint brands go well with this pouring medium, so just test out.<br />paint brands mostly used are the Global impasto paints, Amsterdam paints, pebeo paints,also Mont marte studio acrylics, or pouring paints.<br />I Certainly explore different brands and mediums, it’s all part of the learning process.<br /><br />Also iv started to add a tablespoon of floetrol to each paint cup and stir instead of silicone for cells.<br /><br />Extra special cell and lace and bloom like creation is found with Amsterdam paints add Aussie floetrol until correct consistency required, then used in pour or used to swipe details, “Aussie slides” are easily created this method.<br /><br />If I add silicone this is what I do.<br />When iv mixed my paints I add 2-4 drops maximum of Helmar silicone, also Australian made, I stir in well.<br />I always like to mix up my paints and add silicone the day before I’m going to paint, and cover with a damp cloth, as I have found I have much better results.<br />Recipe and video for this technique is here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/b7u9w_zZdUE​">https://youtu.be/b7u9w_zZdUE​</a><br /><br
