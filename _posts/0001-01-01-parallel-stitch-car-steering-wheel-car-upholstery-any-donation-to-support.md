An additional option, could be the sewing of  'double stitches/french seams' beforehand...then, align and glue the seams one in front of the other.<br />These stitches are mostly used in sporty styles for steering-wheels'.<br />A thicker thread could be used to add a better view.<br />I hope you find it useful!<br />Cesar{% endraw %}
