{% raw %}Wargeh Bushcraft Camping<br /><br />How to build a survival shelter with a fireplace inside. Primitive hut, Bushcraft skills, asmr, diy, Off grid, Winter wild camping, wilderness, campfire cooking. I built this hut in the bush using only hand tools and materials. Me and my dog are having a great time build this hunting lodge in the Forest.<br /><br />I found a boar carcass shot by hunters next to the campsite. I set up a camera trap in front of the pig carcass. When I checked the camera in the morning, the wolves, coyotes and a fox had been caught. I accidentally reset it while transferring these images to my computer to share with you. I lost all the images in the camera trap.<br /><br />My videos cover bushcraft, winter wild camping, fishing, shelter, off grid, log cabin, primitive technology, wilderness survival and outdoor skills, diy, asmr, bushcraft gear like axes, knives, saws, backpacks, clothing systems, shelters and cooking gear.<br /><br />Subscribe to my channel!! <br />For more experience  adventures with me !!!!!<br /><br />Thank you for watching!!!!<br /><br />Follow Me On:<br />Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/wargeh_bushcraft">https://www.instagram.com/wargeh_bushcraft</a><br />Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/WargehBushcraft">https://www.facebook.com/WargehBushcraft</a><br />Twitter:       <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/wargeh1">https://twitter.com/wargeh1</a><br /><br />#hut, #camping, #bushcraft{% endraw %}
