{% raw %}#PandaStory: (Audio available) Just after 11am Mei Xiang came indoors with Xiao Qi Ji on her heels. As she tried to rest, Qi Ji walked on top of her and proceeded to start biting her neck. After a bit, Mei moved, and no surprise, Qi Ji followed. A 15 minute play/bite fest ensued, only part of which is shown here.<br /><br />The play continued outdoors (not shown), and at the end, Qi Ji raced up his tree and purposefully tumbled off the branch. Afterward, it's a bit hard to see, but Qi Ji tumbles down through the salad patch on the left side of the screen.<br /><br />Back indoors, the cam caught Qi Ji in the middle of a splash-fest in his pool! He was totally adorable as he slid into the water, paddled the water with a paw, and rubbed his face and ears anointing himself with the water! Afterward he played with his tub, did a bit of wall walking, and then he surprised Mei as she was resting on the rockwork. She lets out her &quot;scary bear&quot; sound, but he just kept being silly, rolling around on the floor, going back into the pool, and playing with his tub again.<br /><br />He joins her for bamboo in room 3, but decided to take a dip in that pool too. He slides off the rockwork's ledge, does some door dancing (nice to see again as he took a break from this behavior), and went and played with his tub again! And repeat ...<br /><br />Outdoors he rolls around in the dirt under the tree anointing himself. Back indoors you can see how dirty he is (again) as he stands up at the tip top of the rockwork to look out the window! When did he get so tall?<br /><br />Note from Doxie:  I respectively ask that you do not post comments disparaging the Smithsonian's National Zoo's treatment of their Giant Pandas, or Mei Xiang's parenting of Xiao Qi Ji, or any comparisons to other Zoos.
