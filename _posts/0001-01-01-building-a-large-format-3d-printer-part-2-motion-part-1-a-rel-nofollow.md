This printer has an industrial build envelope of 4’x4’x4’ (1220mm x 1220mm x 1220mm). A typical filament extruder is not capable of pumping enough plastic to cover this massive build volume. Therefore, Massive Dimension’s MDPH2 pellet extruder, which is capable of depositing 1 kg of molten plastic an hour, will be used to generate the layers for some massive objects. However, the MDPH2 weighs nearly 18lbs (~8.5kg), which requires a serious linear motion platform to move around. <br /><br />Dr. D-Flo constructed 7 of OpenBuilds' C-beam linear actuators to create a rigid and repeatable cartesian system that uses 4 actuators for the Z-axis, 2 for the Y-axis, and 1 for the X-axis. With a couple modifications shown in this video, these actuators that are upgraded for high temperature operation. This video covers the assembly of these linear actuators and their installation into the frame built in part I of this series. By the end of this video, it will be possible to position the MDPH2 at any position in the build envelope. <br /><br />Subscribe for Part 3!<br /><br />Table of Contents: <br />00:00 – Introduction <br />01:25 – Critical Speed <br />05:23 – High-Temperature Actuator Design <br />09:15 – Carriage Assembly <br />11:23 – Actuator Assembly<br />13:18 – Quad Gantry Leveling (QGL) Design <br />17:09 – Machining X-Y Joint <br />19:25 – Wiring <br />21:15 – Plasma Cutting Panels <br />24:20 – Bed Heater Tease<br />24:20 – Bed Heater Tease<br />25:55 – Linear Motion Testing{% endraw %}
