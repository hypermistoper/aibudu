{% raw %}OPINION: Matt Sorrentino (@Swagmattic)'s opinions discussed in this video in no way deem a political stance of Fisherman's Headquarters and are solely his own. What are yours? <br /><br />At last night's advisory panel it was voted that there would be a less than 1 inch micro slot limit as 2/3rd's of this years bag limit.  The public comment was adamantly in favor of the slot limit but the public backlash from those who didn't make the meeting is quite the opposite.  NJ was given an increased quota in 2022 but to many anglers the new limits feel like a cut back.  What are your thoughts?  Sound off in the comments below. <br /><br />To read more about the meeting check out our blog post at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fishinglbi.com/2022/03/08/nj-fluke-sea-bass-and-scup-regs-for-2022/">https://fishinglbi.com/2022/03/08/nj-fluke-sea-bass-and-scup-regs-for-2022/</a>{% endraw %}
