{% raw %}HELLO MY LOVES!!!<br />This video follows minho on his radio show, best choice, where he talks about his passion for sports. in the midst of such a subject, a very-comfortable-minho decides to introduce a 'segment' of &quot;minho vs producers&quot; where he basically roasts the sh!t out of them while they roast him back. it was a segment that carried on throughout his time of hosting the show, bringing great laughs to him, the staff, and those who were watching. <br />this video also stars onew and key with bits of their episodes!!<br />hope you enjoy!!<br /><br />please note to not take anything he or the staff says too seriously, its all just jokes and banter!! he and the staff have a very friendly and comfortable relationship.<br /><br />now a note from me.<br />if you follow me on any type of social media other than here,  you may have realised that i've been pretty MIA for the past couple of months. due to an extremely busy personal life, it has been difficult for me to put the proper time and effort into content (especially on tiktok). as i have said before, my youtube channel is my prioritised social media amongst the others, so if i'm not uploading elsewhere, you bet its because i'm making a youtube video with the all little time that i have (i'm sure i will have more time in the future)     :)<br /><br />subtitle references:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/tOqwcHg_fKA">https://youtu.be/tOqwcHg_fKA</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rVL5mdbB8pA">https://youtu.be/rVL5mdbB8pA</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/6RK3Q2M4XAE">https://youtu.be/6RK3Q2M4XAE</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/zk6WrCKTmSg">https://youtu.be/zk6WrCKTmSg</a><br /><br />#minho #SHINee #kpop{% endraw %}
