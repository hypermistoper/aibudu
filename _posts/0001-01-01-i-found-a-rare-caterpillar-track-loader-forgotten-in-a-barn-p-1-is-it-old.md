{% raw %}I recently discovered this 60+ year old Caterpillar No 6 Shovel that's been sitting for 12-14 years at a farm not too far away. Apparently they parked it one day, and it hasn't moved since!<br /><br />Grandpa has honored me with the privilege of rescuing this old machine and I plan to bring it back to life, &amp; then BACK TO WORK! <br /><br />Today, we will take a look at the basics - from checking out the overall condition of the machine to some of the diagnostics to see what it will take to get this old machine up and running. <br /><br />I am looking for a GREAT name for this machine, so WHAT should we name this beast?<br /><br />This will be a little different than normal content, and my plan is to create a new video of the progress I make on the old machine as each day passes. We'll see how this goes, but I'd love to know your thoughts on the different content style!<br /><br />Thanks as always for watching and following along with all my crazy adventures here on Salvage Workshop!<br /><br />~<br /><br />0:00 - Discovering a Caterpillar No 6 Shovel<br />9:28 - Clearing out around the machine<br />14:15 - Taking the hood off of the machine<br />16:25 - Checking the fluids<br />18:36 - Taking a look at the pony motor<br />21:24 - Taking a look at the fuel tank<br />25:06 - Jump n Carry - jumper pack<br />26:50 - Firing up the pony motor<br />28:45 - Upcoming plans for this machine and the channel<br /><br />~<br /><br />Check out this machine's younger brother, OLD RED.
