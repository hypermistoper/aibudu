{% raw %}German History Portrayed by Minecraft<br /><br />Hey bruvs, in this video you'll learn about the history of Germany, portrayed by Minecraft! From the fall of the Western Roman Empire to the Germanic tribes, to the unification of Germany, to the World Wars, up to today, this video covers many of the major events in German history. Also, this video took a long time to make, research, building the scenes (I built that entire Reichstag from scratch just for this video), and editing. Juggling this as well as college took a lot of work, so I hope you enjoy :)<br /><br />I recently launched my channel membership, so for just 99 cents per month you can support my channel and gain some epic perks, including shoutouts at the end of my videos to members.
