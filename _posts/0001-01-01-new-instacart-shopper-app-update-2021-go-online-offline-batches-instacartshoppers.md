{% raw %}#instacartshoppers #Instacart<br />In today's video, I am talking about the new Instacart Shopper App&quot; Update, Go Online&quot; button in the shopper app. This is a brand new update that will help shoppers identify their closest stores and where they may want to shop, next. Instacart is requiring shoppers to let them know when they are online or offline and will be able to indicate when shoppers are actively looking for batches. I show you the exact email from Instacart and show you what the new shopper update Go Online version of the app looks like.<br /><br />Not all Instacart Shoppers have received this App update, yet. The shoppers who have received this update are not happy with this new change as they feel this is Instacart's way of forcing less than ideal batches upon shoppers and punishing them if they choose not to accept these batches while online. The verdict is still out, as this is a brand new App update!<br /><br />Instacart stated in their email to shoppers regarding this update, &quot;We're always working to provide the best shopping experience, and look forward to continuing to enhance the Shopper App over time.&quot;<br /><br />Time will, indeed tell.<br /><br />Thank you all for sharing your thoughts regarding this update in the comments, below.<br /><br />Peace &amp; Love,<br /><br />Jen<br /><br />Email- jenonthego2@gmail.com<br />Instagram-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jenonthego2/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/jenonthego2/?hl=en</a>{% endraw %}
