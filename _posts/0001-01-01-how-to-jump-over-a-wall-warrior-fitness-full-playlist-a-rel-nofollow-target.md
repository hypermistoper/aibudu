This is a wall, we have this in our facility at Warrior Fitness Boot Camp, and what you're going to do is approach the wall and use your momentum to jump up and over, swing your legs over to the other side, and land nice and firm on the ground. It's going to look like this: approach it, jump up, grab the top, jump up, lay on top with your chest, swing your legs up and over, and land. Again just approach it, grab to top, lie on top with your chest or your stomach, swing your legs up and over, and land nice and firm on the ground.<br /><br /><br /><br />That's how you jump over a wall. A little bit of advice when jumping over this wall is a lot of time people have hang ups; once they jump over they can't seem to get their full momentum over the top so they end up looking like this. Uh, uh! You can try and use your feet. Use your feet to try and climb up. It might help you push up, be able to get enough of your body up and over so you can swing that leg up and land on the other side. But, if you can't do that, try wedging that forearm up there, OK?<br /><br /><br /><br />Put one forearm up, one hand up, one forearm up, one hand up, and just again use that forearm to kind of nudge yourself up there. Don't give up. Keep pushing until you're able to slide up and swing that leg up and over. Then, you can land and jump on the other side. That's a couple tricks for how you can jump over the wall.{% endraw %}
