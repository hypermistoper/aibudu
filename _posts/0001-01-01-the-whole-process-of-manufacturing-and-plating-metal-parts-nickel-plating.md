{% raw %}Hi,  in this video you will see how to make a furniture front  stand and <br />plating it . The first part of the video, you will see how to make a movie in about four minutes. In the continuation of the video, you will see how the product is plated. The plating process is such that the part is first polished and smoothed. In the next step, the part is cleaned so that the plating material is better placed on it, and in the next step, the plating process begins and the product turns into a steel color. This is where the plating process ends, and if we want the piece to be golden, another step is added to it, and at the end it is placed in the furnace to better absorb the golden material. In this video, there are all these processes except the part in the oven. I hope this video was helpful.<br />#NickelPlating #MetalPlating<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />I hope you enjoy watching this video.<br />Do not forget to like and comment.<br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />-subscribe my channel :<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrVep9DJdzEFKd_10UsXdwQ?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrVep9DJdzEFKd_10UsXdwQ?sub_confirmation=1</a>{% endraw %}
