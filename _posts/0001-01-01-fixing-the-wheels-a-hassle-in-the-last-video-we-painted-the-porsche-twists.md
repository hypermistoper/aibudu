{% raw %}In the last video we painted the Porsche Twists but after putting 2k clear over the enamel paint, the finish bubbled and wrinkled up. Over the past few days, I've been trying to sand down and then repaint the wheels which worked in some spots and failed in others. Now we are fully stripping the wheels and repainting them from scratch. Spoiler alert: Stripping 18 layers of paint SUCKS 10/10 will not do again.{% endraw %}
