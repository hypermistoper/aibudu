Days 120-500 were streamed on Twitch, but the rest was mostly done offline. In 2021, the run was played on and off, so I don't know exactly how many real life hours it took to achieve this.<br />- No mods were used.<br />- The opening montage consist of various moments that are mostly from Days 1-600, in no particular order.<br />- The title shot of me walking towards a campfire is from Day 880, and is from me cooking the Bear and Moose that attacked me the day before.<br />- The sound during the Merry-go-round moose was lost, and sound from three similar encounters were dubbed on top, which is why it may sound slightly off. The same applies to the Wolf nest footage, where I was talking over the ingame sound, and so it got partially replaced.<br />- The Wolf Barrier was an invisible protective barrier around Angler's Den in Ash Canyon. It prevented wolves from entering the base, making the player completely safe. With Perilous Constraint, they removed this barrier, resulting in me being attacked.<br />- When I fell through the ice, I genuinely thought that the little snow patch I stood on counted as land, and I wouldn't fall through. The wolf attack was about 30 seconds later.<br />- The campfire sign at the end was prepared around Day 970 but only tested during the daytime, to preserve suspense for the final day. The celebration took place on Day 1003 due to poor weather previous nights. The actual crossing into Day 1000 happened by the Riken, so the clip is not 100% accurate timewise. One match was used to light all fires, with coal and firewood prepared in advance. The outro shot of me walking towards the lighthouse is from when I am planning to set this fire.<br />- Unlike the 500 Days video, all shots from Day 500-100 are from the actual run (the 500 Day video had a few recreated shots due to lost footage). Almost all of the footage was captured offline, with a few exceptions (whenever my youtube/twitter appears, it usually means it was streamed).<br /><br />I give some of the animals in the game names. I call the Ash Canyon bear &quot;Boris&quot; because he almost always manages to dodge my arrows and maul me (a reference to Boris the Bullet Dodger from Snatch). As some point, I started calling rabbits &quot;Barry&quot;, and the only indoor rabbit became &quot;Larry&quot;. The other animals, &quot;Fluffy&quot;, &quot;Skethcy&quot; (featured in the video), and &quot;Scruffy&quot; are community-created names.<br />Feel free to adopt these names.{% endraw %}
