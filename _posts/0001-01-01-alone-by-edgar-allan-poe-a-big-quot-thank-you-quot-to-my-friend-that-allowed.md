{% raw %}🔰A big &quot;thank you&quot; to my friend that allowed me to film her for this movie.<br /><br />🔰The king of misery himself Edgar Allan Poe. Although this poem didn't make him famous, it was discovered after his death and it was written when he was 20. I can't help but imagine how many other poems, paintings or any work of art did not get discovered and remain to this day hidden. Art without an audience is self-therapy, so please if you create art publish it.  <br /><br />🔰Support me on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/illneas">https://www.patreon.com/illneas</a><br /><br />🔰Find me here 🔗<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/_illneas/">https://www.instagram.com/_illneas/</a><br />                            🔗<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/illneas/">https://www.facebook.com/illneas/</a><br />                            🔗<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/illneas">https://twitter.com/illneas</a><br /><br />Second channel<br />🔗<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3urbsMSDr9XmgtnFdWZe_Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3urbsMSDr9XmgtnFdWZe_Q</a><br /><br />🔰Communities <br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/kfxthmS3F4">https://discord.gg/kfxthmS3F4</a><br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2314655172176122/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2314655172176122/</a><br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchingformeaning/">https://www.reddit.com/r/searchingformeaning/</a><br /><br />🔰References <br /><br />-The narrator is Tom O'Bedlam<br /><br />-The music is this: Jakob Ahlbom - Fracture<br /><br />🔰My equipment: <br />I film handheld with a Panasonic Lumix <br />G80<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2uGqmQZ">https://amzn.to/2uGqmQZ</a><br />GX80<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/33e5Tye">https://amzn.to/33e5Tye</a><br />📷Olympus M.Zuiko Digital 45mm F1.8 Lens  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2vr9P3N">https://amzn.to/2vr9P3N</a><br /><br />“Alone”<br />BY EDGAR ALLAN POE<br />From childhood’s hour I have not been<br />As others were—I have not seen<br />As others saw—I could not bring<br />My passions from a common spring—<br />From the same source I have not taken<br />My sorrow—I could not awaken<br />My heart to joy at the same tone—<br />And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—<br />Then—in my childhood—in the dawn<br />Of a most stormy life—was drawn<br />From ev’ry depth of good and ill<br />The mystery which binds me still—<br />From the torrent, or the fountain—<br />From the red cliff of the mountain—<br />From the sun that ’round me roll’d<br />In its autumn tint of gold—<br />From the lightning in the sky<br />As it pass’d me flying by—<br />From the thunder, and the storm—<br />And the cloud that took the form<br />(When the rest of Heaven was blue)<br />Of a demon in my view—{% endraw %}
