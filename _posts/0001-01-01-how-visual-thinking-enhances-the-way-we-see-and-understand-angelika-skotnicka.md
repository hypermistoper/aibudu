{% raw %}Angelika Skotnicka uses graphic recording to help interpret other people and communicate her ideas. she argues that because we think in visual images no matter what our background,  nationality and culture - this way of understanding reality increases our ability to share ideas and understand each other.  Angelika Skotnicka is an English teacher, ICF coach, teacher trainer and graphic recorder. She has taught English for 11 years, and four years ago, she decided to start her own company, an English school where the teachers implement visual thinking strategies and graphic recording skills as part of the curriculum. Angelika is passionate about supporting others on their path to self-development and helping to create a new generation of future leaders. She says there is no better insight into what the future generation will be like than that gained from teaching a classroom full of people. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
