Muito obrigada!<br /><br />Lyrics<br /><br />Did I abuse her or show her disdain<br />Why does she run from me<br />If I should lose her how shall I regain<br />The heart she has won from me<br />Agony, beyond power of speech<br />When the one thing you want<br />Is the only thing out of your reach<br /><br />High in her tower she sits by the hour<br />Maintaining her hair<br />Blithe and becoming and frequently humming<br />A light-hearted air<br />Ah<br />Agony, far more painful than yours<br />When you know she would go with you<br />If there only were doors<br />Agony, all the torture they teach<br />What's as intruiging or half so fatiguing<br />As what's out of reach<br /><br />Am I not sensitive, clever<br />Well-mannered, considerate<br />Passionate, charming<br />As kind as I'm handsome<br />And heir to a throne?<br />You are everything maidens could wish for<br />Then why no<br />Do I know?<br />The girl must be mad<br />You know nothing of madness<br />'Til you're climbing her hair<br />And you see her up there as you're nearing her<br />And all the while hearing her<br />Ah<br />Agony, misery, though it's different for each<br />Always ten steps behind, always ten steps below<br />And she's just out of reach<br />Agony, that can cut like a knife<br />I must have her to wife{% endraw %}
