{% raw %}Jair Bolsonaro's pro-markets stance helped him win the support of Brazil's business elite - and eventually the presidency. So why do some experts say his policies have held back the country's economic potential?<br /><br />-<br /><br />At the turn of the century, Brazil was touted for its huge economic potential. <br /><br />The South American country was named alongside Russia, India and China as the emerging markets with the ability to eclipse the world's biggest economies. <br /><br />&quot;But then from 2011 to 2014, you had a slowdown in the Brazilian economy. This was due both to changes in the external sector, but also what I consider some mistakes in the economic policy framework,&quot; said Laura Carvalho, a Brazilian economist and best-selling author. <br /><br />The deep economic recession that followed, coupled with political turmoil, fueled the rise of an unlikely winner in the 2018 general election: Jair Bolsonaro. <br /><br />Among his supporters were Brazil's business elite, who were optimistic that Bolsonaro could turn around the Latin American country's fortunes. <br /><br />That belief appeared supported by Bolsonaro's appointment of businessman and free-market advocate Paulo Guedes as economy minister, as well as by the Brazilian leader's pro-business speech at the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting in Davos in 2019. <br /><br />&quot;We will work to lower the tax burden, streamline rules and make life easier for those who wish to produce and do business,&quot; Bolsonaro said then. <br /><br />Brazil's economic comeback, however, has not happened. Economists like Carvalho point to several policies that are holding the country back. <br /><br />&quot;Even the people who were supporting him for that reason are very disappointed,&quot; she said, &quot;because he did not carry out the structural reforms and the type of economic policies that have been promised in his campaign.&quot; <br /><br />What went wrong?
