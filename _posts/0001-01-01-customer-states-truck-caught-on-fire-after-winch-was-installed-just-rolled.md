Lol&quot;<br />0:21 No extra info. But they are lucky it didn't go up in flames.<br />A good thing to note though, is if you ever modify your exhaust, look what's around before doing so.<br />0:37 2018 Ford Raptor. The customer ended up trading it in for a Super Duty after it was fixed under warranty.  I've heard and seen this happen often on these Raptors from people jumping them and the front differential taking most of the impact when it's landing. In the clip, you see the front differential housing is cracked in multiple spots + where it mounts to. You also see the axle shaft is twisted/broken. I'm going to say whoever owned it was hitting some jumps.<br />1:03 A good reminder to change your timing belts when needed. <br />I believe the replacement interval on that timing belt is every 105000 miles / 168981 kilometres. It's also an interference engine, which means If a timing belt breaks while driving in an interference engine, the camshaft stops turning leaving some of the engine valves in the open position. The heavier crankshaft will continue rotating by inertia, moving pistons up and down. This will cause the pistons to strike the valves that are left open.<br />1:15 A very unusual voicemail that this shop received. lol!<br />1:31 What you see in this clip is called tire cupping. Worn-out suspension components like shocks, struts, bushings, and other components can cause this. The tire is no longer able to roll smoothly down the road and it bounces slightly causing this. This bouncing creates uneven points of pressure on tires, leading to tire cupping. I've also seen this happen on some brands of tires. <br />1:47 The technician said it was a young kid driving the car and he thinks they actually jumped it. But they ended up getting a new subframe and oil pan installed.<br />2:03 The technician said: &quot; I don't recall what vehicle this was(Dodge or Jeep). The customer said he smelled fuel and had a puddle on his garage floor. I have no idea what caused it.&quot;<br />Looks like maybe the customer rubbed the fuel tank against a rock/object. <br />2:19 I've driven some trucks with big wheels and tires (customers trucks) and they never drove well. But since the vehicle got aligned with 20-inch wheels on the truck, it's definitely going to handle differently than before.<br />2:30 No extra info.<br />2:34 Customer paid $8000 for this Jeep. No extra info.<br />2:48 Never had/seen an AirBag randomly deployed but the vehicle is a 1991 Mazda Miata and a lot of people modify them, so maybe a chance the customer was playing with some wiring or the airbags on this vehicle.<br />3:01 Outro. Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
