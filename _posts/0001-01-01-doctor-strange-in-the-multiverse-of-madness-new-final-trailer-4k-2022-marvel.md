{% raw %}Doctor Strange’s next adventure is almost ready for the big screen, but Marvel has a few last-minute spoilers to pull out first. In the newest trailer for Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, Marvel basically confirms two new cameos, but hopefully there will still be a few twists when the movie arrives in theaters on May 6.<br /><br />After months of speculation, it seems we finally know that Patrick Stewart’s Professor X will play an important role in the latest Doctor Strange movie. When Strange’s former ally Baron Mordo cuffs Strange and leads him into a mysterious room, he also introduces Stephen to the Illuminati.<br /><br />More importantly though, a wrinkled old hand shows up on the end of what looks like a high-tech wheelchair. This image is accompanied by Stewart’s voice in the familiar Charles Xavier cadence he’s been doing since his first X-Men movie in 2000. Of course, we don’t get a look at his face, and we don’t know what his role will be yet, but this does seem to confirm that he’s in the movie and that Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness will, more or less, introduce the X-Men to the MCU.<br /><br />A hand that appears to belong to Patrick Stewart’s Charles Xavier in Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness trailer<br />Image: Marvel<br />That’s not the only tease we get in this trailer either. We also see a Captain America-style shield emblazoned with the Union Jack, which likely belongs to Captain Peggy Carter, who became the first Avenger in Marvel’s animated What If...? episode “What if... Captain Carter Were the First Avenger?”<br /><br />****Direct Donations Fund the content: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/ADedits">https://paypal.me/ADedits</a><br /><br />✔️Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsX-zRuq3ovMsgFqEQLw2Bw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsX-zRuq3ovMsgFqEQLw2Bw/join</a><br /><br />✔️Buy me a Coffee and support the content <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ADedits">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ADedits</a><br /><br />✔️My Amazon Store of all of my equipment I personally use: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/ad_edits">https://www.amazon.com/shop/ad_edits</a><br /><br />✔️Grab the First Edition MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/ad-empire">https://teespring.com/stores/ad-empire</a><br /><br />✔️Check out my other stuff on my channel!  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsX-zRuq3ovMsgFqEQLw2Bw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsX-zRuq3ovMsgFqEQLw2Bw</a><br /><br />✔️Follow me on Instagram: @alexdaniel9: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/alexdaniel9...">https://www.instagram.com/alexdaniel9...</a><br /><br />✔️Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/ADedits9/?re...">https://www.facebook.com/ADedits9/?re...</a><br /><br />✔️Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AD_edits">https://twitter.com/AD_edits</a><br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br />MUSIC CREDIT: <br />Audiomachine - <br /><br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br />VIDEO CREDIT: <br />Lucasfilm <br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Contribute CC to the video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?tab=2&amp;c=UCsX-zRuq3ovMsgFqEQLw2Bw">http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?tab=2&amp;c=UCsX-zRuq3ovMsgFqEQLw2Bw</a><br /><br /><br />*This video is a parody DUE to its derivative/ transformative nature this video is covered as a Fair Use of material.*<br /><br /><br /><br />TAGS: (IGNORE)<br />_ #doctorstrange #finaltrailer #marvelstudios <br />doctor strange in the multiverse of madness,doctor strange in the multiverse of madness trailer,doctor strange in the multiverse of madness official trailer,doctor strange in the multiverse of madness trailer 2,doctor strange 2 trailer,doctor strange 2 official trailer,doctor strange 2 trailer 2,multiverse of madness trailer,doctor strange 2 first look,doctor strange 2 trailer official,doctor strange 2 new trailer,multiverse of madness new trailer,defender strange,mcu,doctor strange 2 super bowl trailer,doctor strange,doctor strange 2,doctor strange in the multiverse of madness tv spot,doctor strange 2 multiverse of madness,doctor strange 2 in the multiverse of madness,doctor strange 2 tv spot,dr strange multiverse of madness,super bowl,super bowl tv spot{% endraw %}
