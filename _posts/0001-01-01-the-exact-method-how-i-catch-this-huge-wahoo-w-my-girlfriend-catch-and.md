{% raw %}You don't have to high speed troll to catch wahoo! This is how we catch a wahoo with a simple setup trolling all artificial lures.<br />Visit my shop here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://RWBoutdoors.com">https://RWBoutdoors.com</a><br /><br />In the beginning of this fishing video on how to catch Wahoo I show you a map of where we will be offshore trolling and then go over the rigs we are trolling.<br /><br />We are fishing between 110-190ft depth water right off the reefs edge off Key Largo in the Florida Keys.<br /><br />We are trolling dive plugs between 7-9mph<br /><br />We catch a wahoo with this method and then it's wahoo catch and cook time! It would have been a catch clean cook but it was too dark when I cleaned the wahoo so it'll just be a good ole catch n cook<br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬ Big Thank You to My Sponsors! ▬▬▬▬▬<br /><br />Want to advertise your product or collaborate on the South Florida Fishing Channel?<br />Email me: Heiko@southfloridafishingchannel.com<br /><br />Support the Channel by getting some of our fishing rigs or merch:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://RWBoutdoors.com">https://RWBoutdoors.com</a><br /><br />************************************<br /><br />Custom fishing team jerseys here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tampaclothing.com/">https://tampaclothing.com/</a><br /><br />Fish Pendants: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.seashurjewelry.com/">https://www.seashurjewelry.com/</a><br />15% off with Code: South Florida Fishing Channel<br /><br />Sonar/Rader &amp; Boat Electronics<br />5% off link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.atlanticrt.com/juicy.html">https://www.atlanticrt.com/juicy.html</a><br /><br /><br />Subscribe or I'll steal all your bait!<br /><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/southfloridafishingchannel/">https://www.facebook.com/southfloridafishingchannel/</a><br />SFFC Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/southfloridafishingchannel">https://www.instagram.com/southfloridafishingchannel</a><br />My Personal Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/heikowinkler/">https://www.instagram.com/heikowinkler/</a><br />RWBoutdoors Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/redwhiteblueoutdoors/">https://www.instagram.com/redwhiteblueoutdoors/</a><br /><br />▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬<br /><br />WIN fishing gear and support the channel.

If it's a tuna or wahoo, she'll reel it in and hopefully I'll gaff it.<br /><br />So trolling a dive plug at 9mph in this video is one way on how to catch wahoo without high speed trolling.<br /><br />I hope this video helps you if you've been wondering how to catch a wahoo off Florida and you too end up with a wahoo catch and cook experience<br /><br />Cheers!{% endraw %}
