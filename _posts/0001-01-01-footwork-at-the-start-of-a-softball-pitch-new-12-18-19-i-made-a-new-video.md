{% raw %}NEW (12/18/19): I made a NEW video on the pitching rule changes watch ⇢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/H-bY8AYVkK4">https://youtu.be/H-bY8AYVkK4</a><br /><br />The rule changes have to do with the stride foot start position. (Left foot for righties, right foot for lefties). I would definitely consider these pretty significant rule changes - and it’s affecting all different levels &amp; softball organizations!<br /><br />Here is a video I shot months ago BEFORE the rules were changed.<br /><br />This video is still important so that you will be able to see the “before” and “after” of the new, legal footwork.<br /><br />This is a HOT TOPIC right now, and I will also be making a video of my opinion on the new rule changes after I explain them!<br /><br />Important in THIS video is to pay attention to how I explain the two different ways to start with your front foot (your drag foot). The information in the video regarding the front foot start position will not change, so make sure you listen in for a couple of different options!<br /><br />#SoftballPitching #Softball<br />- -- -<br />Did you know that there are a few different ways to start with your feet on the pitching rubber?<br /><br />Let me show you what’s legal, usually what is considered illegal.<br /><br />Then ALSO, show you a couple of different ways to legally start your feet so you can see which is most comfortable for you to get the best start to your pitch!<br /><br />Important: When I say “legal,” I am referring to the rules that MOST organizations go by, including college where both feet need to start touching the pitching rubber. I know that there are some leagues or even in high school where you don’t have to have your back foot touching, and I address that{% endraw %}
