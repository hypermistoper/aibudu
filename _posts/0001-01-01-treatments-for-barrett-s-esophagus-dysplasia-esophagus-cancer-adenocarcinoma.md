{% raw %}Over time, gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, can lead to Barrett's esophagus, dysplasia or even esophagus cancer (adenocarcinoma.) This video discusses options for people with high-grade dysplasia and treatments to remove or destroy abnormal cells, including surgery (esophagectomy), and non-surgical endoscopic options, (endoscopic mucosal resection, photodynamic therapy, radiofrequency ablation and cryotherapy.)  Mayo Clinic has a very large team with an international reputation for its skill in diagnosing and treating reflux, Barrett's esophagus and esophagus cancer.
