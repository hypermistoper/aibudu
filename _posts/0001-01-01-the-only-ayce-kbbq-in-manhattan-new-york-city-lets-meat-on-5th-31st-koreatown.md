{% raw %}&quot;Lets Meat&quot; is a AYCE KBBQ restaurant located on 5th Ave between 31st Street and 32nd Street. A Real Korean BBQ restaurant with real Korean People in it. This is the ONLY AYCE BBQ in all of  Manhattan.<br /><br />Koreatown have so many great places to eat at! So why choose &quot;Lets Meat&quot;? PRICE. If you ate this much food at Miss Korea or Wonjo, it would cost 3 to 4 times the price. Would their meat be better? Yes, but at 3 - 4 times the price. <br /><br />&quot;Lets Meat&quot; also have a reasonably priced LUNCH SPECIAL on weekdays, but beware their two person policy.<br /><br />This Content was shot on the iPhone 13 Pro, 4K.
