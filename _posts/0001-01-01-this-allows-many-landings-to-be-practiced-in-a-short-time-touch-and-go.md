{% raw %}In aviation, a touch-and-go landing (TGL) or circuit is a maneuver that is common when learning to fly a fixed-wing aircraft. It involves landing on a runway and taking off again without coming to a full stop. Usually the pilot then circles the airport in a defined pattern known as a circuit and repeats the maneuver. This allows many landings to be practiced in a short time.<br /><br />If the pilot brings the aircraft to a full stop before taking off again then it is known as &quot;stop-and-go&quot;.<br /><br />Touch-and-go landings are also crucial when a plane lands with not enough space to come to a complete stop, but has enough space to accelerate and take off again to carry out a go-around.<br /><br />In British parlance, the maneuver is often called circuits and bumps<br />Please share this YouTube link, or the link in our official Facebook.<br />❗️WARNING❗️Freebooting/ reuploading without specific written permission is not authorized. <br />This video is the copyright of TopFelya © All illegal re uploads will be removed<br /><br />#Aviation #Aircraft #Landings{% endraw %}
