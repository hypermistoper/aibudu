{% raw %}Organised by Pete Aldiss, Novo Nordisk Foundation Center for Basic Metabolic Research, University of Copenhagen, Denmark and Jo Lewis, University of Cambridge, UK<br /><br />Whilst various hormonal and molecular pathways contribute to obesity, many of which have been discussed in this series, obesity is ultimately caused by a chronic energy surplus which drives slow, progressive weight gain over an extended period of time. In this final ECR focused session we heard from two outstanding researchers investigating the role of nutrition in managing body weight and metabolic health.<br /><br />First, Sofia Cienfeugos (University of Illinois, Chicago, USA) presented her work on how 4 and 6-hour time-restricted feeding can impact body weight and cardiometabolic health in adults with obesity.<br /><br />Then, Lauren Milley (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive Kidney Diseases, National Institutes of Health, USA) presented her work on ad libitum energy intake during plant-based low-fat versus animal-based ketogenic diets.<br /><br />This was part of the ‘Physiology of Obesity: From Mechanisms to Medicine’ series.{% endraw %}
