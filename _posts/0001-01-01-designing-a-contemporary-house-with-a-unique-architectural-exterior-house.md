{% raw %}Designed by Stukel Architecture in collaboration with AJP Constructions, Zig Zag House makes waves as a contemporary house in an environment dominated by traditional cottages. Named after its distinctively dynamic architecture, the home is a sculptural response to its Kensington site. As a contemporary house, the architecture of the home reflects the movement of water, paying homage to the waterway that cuts through the landscape connecting Centennial Park and Botany Bay.<br /><br />Architecturally, the contemporary house is both impressive and bold. An overhang to the west orientation internally defines the home’s lounge, kitchen and dining spaces whilst a large blade column – inserted into the stairs – provides a solid focal point within a generous open space.<br /><br />The interior design of Zig Zag House sees typical materials elevated through considered treatment. A seamless quality is inhered in the venetian plaster blade column, while a concrete wall is marked to elegantly resemble a particular grain of timber. The treatment of each material brings to the surface subtle aesthetic qualities, establishing the home as a contemporary house.<br /><br />Located in the Sydney suburb of Kensington, Zig Zag House introduces 21st century architecture into the urban milieu. Visualised by Stukel Architecture and skilfully executed by AJP Constructions, Zig Zag House stands as a contemporary house that testifies to a successful design collaboration. <br /><br />00:00 - Introduction to the Contemporary House<br />00:49 - The Relationship between Architect and Builder<br />01:14 - The Client Brief<br />01:48 - The Unique Ceiling Form<br />02:52 - Building the Roof<br />03:24 - The Stairs<br />04:10 - Unique Use of Materials <br />05:17 - Concrete Finishes <br />06:13 - The Architects Favourite Part of the House<br /><br />For more from The Local Project: <br /><br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/">https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/</a> <br />Website – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/</a> <br />Print Publication – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/</a> <br />The Local Project Marketplace – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/marketplace/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/marketplace/</a> <br /><br />To subscribe to The Local Project's Tri-Annual Print Publication see here – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/</a> <br /><br />Photography by Simon Whitbread.<br />Architecture by Stukel Architecture.<br />Build by AJP Constructions.<br />Filmed and Edited by O&amp;Co.
