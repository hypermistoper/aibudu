So begins a tale that stretches over a number of years, filled with unexpected joys and heartbreaks; Marianne will remerge into his life, as will Eva (a radiant Lily-Rose Depp), the impetuous younger sister of the man he was abandoned for.<br /><br />Shifting points of view as nimbly as its players, this beguiling tale, co-written with the legendary Jean-Claude Carrière (Belle de jour, Cyrano de Bergerac), effortlessly navigates through the bric-à-brac of loves and secrets with a winning, New Wave-esque sensibility; Paris’ streets and cafés appear almost magically unchanged since Truffaut’s 1960’s. However it’s Garrel’s carefully considered yet light touch that charms and captivates, leaving audiences feeling an enduring sense of satisfaction.{% endraw %}
