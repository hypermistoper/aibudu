{% raw %}Hey guys! Today is another episode from my series Thrift Store Makeovers, where I take a used, worn out item (OR sometimes from yard sales or  off of ebay) clean it up, fix it up and decorate it. I love hunting through thrift stores to find old, rejected items and then decorating them and putting my own style on them to turn them into new pieces of art. I've definitely missed these thrift flips and I want to do more thrifting soon!<br /><br />In this episode I am going to be painting on and customizing both a ceramic cupcake bank AND a leather liz claiborne purse. <br /><br />DON'T FORGET! Shelly and Eustace Pre-Order, open for February ONLY:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.moriahelizabethmerch.com/eustace-shelly">https://shop.moriahelizabethmerch.com/eustace-shelly</a><br /><br />___________WELCOME TO MY CHANNEL__________<br /><br />Hey! my name is Moriah (pronounced muh-rye-yuh ðŸ˜‚ ) and this is my channel....obviously. I'm 27 and like doing anything creative...and being snarky.....just a lil. I make a lot of decorating, painting and general art videos here. I'm obsessed with editing and adding lil bits to my videos, so if that's not your thing....oof you may hate this haha. I paint on squishies, thrift store finds, and other random things I pick up. I also love to draw, but don't expect anything too skilled, I'm not the best at that haha. You will also find occasional crafting/testing crafting kits on my channel which are always a hot mess. And even some baking (REALLY bad at that, but it's fun to try LOL). <br /><br />CURRENT SERIES:<br />Squishy Makeovers: Fixing and decorating used squishies sent from my viewers<br />Thrift Store Makeovers: Fixing and decorating stuff I find at thrift stores/yard sales<br />Bake With ME: Recreating squishies I've decorated in real life<br />Create This Book: Drawing in the prompt book that I wrote (available to purchase and follow along)<br />Squishy Unboxing: Opening used squishy packages sent from viewers<br />Craft Kit Testing: pretty self explanatory. testing craft kits.<br /><br />Find Products I Use (contains affiliate links):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://a.co/4XDtrmV">https://a.co/4XDtrmV</a><br /><br /><br />___UPLOAD SCHEDULE___<br /><br />Every Friday at 4:00pm ET: Alternating Squishy Makeovers, Thrift Makeovers, Craft Kit Reviews, Create This Book, Mail Openings and Miscellaneous crafts and DIYs<br /><br /><br />____PURCHASE ME PRODUCTS____<br /><br />CREATE THIS BOOK:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2vUerfI">https://amzn.to/2vUerfI</a><br /><br />CREATE THIS BOOK 2:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f">https://amzn.to/2Nx2G9f</a><br /><br />ME Merchandise:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://moriahelizabethmerch.com/">https://moriahelizabethmerch.com/</a><br /><br />ME Pin &amp; Sticker Shop:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://me-merch.myshopify.com">https://me-merch.myshopify.com</a><br /><br /><br />____ME SOCIALS____<br /><br />INSTAGRAM: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/">https://www.instagram.com/moriahelizabethofficial/</a><br /><br />TIKTOK:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth">https://www.tiktok.com/@moriahelizabeth</a><br /><br />FACEBOOK:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627">https://www.facebook.com/Moriah-Elizabeth-102592864903627</a><br /><br />SNAPCHAT:<br />MoriahOfficial<br /><br />VISIT ME WEBSITE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.moriahelizabeth.com/">https://www.moriahelizabeth.com/</a><br /><br /><br />____CONTACT ME____<br /><br />EMAIL PICTURES OF YOUR ART (Create This Book or Fan art only please):<br />Artwork@Moriah.video<br /><br />FOR BUSINESS INQUIRIES/OPPORTUNITIES ONLY:<br />moriah@nightmedia.co<br /><br /><br />_____MAIL ME_____<br /><br />For sending squishies, Letters, or general fan mail, please contact: FANMAIL@MORIAH.VIDEO to request my P.O. box address <br />(must be 13+ to send mail)<br />ATTENTION: Unfortunately I can only respond to a small amount of people each week.
