/><br />Our plan of action to fix this issue in Utah would be (these steps need to be completed as a sequence or it may not work): <br />1. Mow the lawn and crop the top.  <br />     - If your lawn is higher than 2.5&quot; lower the blade of your mower one or two clicks.  <br />2. no watering for 3 to 5 days.<br />     -  It's important to dry the lawn out.  This will dry the fungus out organically.<br />3. check for thatch (dead grass sitting on top of the soil).  <br />     - If you have an abundance of thatch you will need to power rake the thatch out.<br />4. After day 5 of no watering check to see how much water is in the soil.<br />     - If you have less than 3&quot; of water penetration in the soil you will need to over water the lawn for the next 5 days to get water penetration back to depths of 6&quot; to 8&quot;<br />5. application of fungicide is optional for rust, leaf spot and melting out fungus.<br />     -  If the above steps have been taken it is probable you will push the fungus out without the necessity of a fungicide.<br />6. apply a quick release fertilizer high in nitrogen<br />     -  It is important to use a quick release fertilizer to stimulate new growth.<br />     -  if you have chlorotic issues throughout the lawn you may need to do a series of quick release fertilizers that contain ammonium sulphate (AMS) to balance out the color.<br /><br />Please note if you are having these issues in the middle of summer when it is hot it will take upwards of 4 to 6 weeks for the lawn to fix these issues.  It is important to remember to check watering daily.  For our climate in Utah, during the hot months (daily temps of 90 degrees plus), the lawn will require 1.75&quot; of water per week.{% endraw %}
