Well, this one time, I don't have to: because the robot double's going to do it for me.<br /><br />With many thanks to all the team at Engineered Arts who worked on this. To be clear, this is not sponsored by them, I paid money (technically, NordVPN's money) for the Mesmer robot -- or at least, for the silicone mask and 3D printed skull that were put together for just one day!<br /><br />I'm at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tomscott.com">https://tomscott.com</a><br /><br />on Twitter at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tomscott">https://twitter.com/tomscott</a><br /><br />on Facebook at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/tomscott">https://facebook.com/tomscott</a><br /><br />and on Instagram as tomscottgo{% endraw %}
