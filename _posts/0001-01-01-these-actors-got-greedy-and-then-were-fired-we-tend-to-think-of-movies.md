{% raw %}We tend to think of movies and television shows as having unlimited budgets, but that's not the case. Every penny may not count, but thousands and millions definitely do. When an actor asks for a raise in production, you could say the actors are greedy, or oyu could say they deserve every penny they're asking for and more. And in extreme cases, they ask for so much that it seems like they're pushing the envelope because they want to leave the role. For whatever reason, all of the following actors asked for a bigger slice and lost the whole pie because of it. These are actors who got greedy and then got fired.<br /><br />#Actors #Fired #TVShows<br /><br />Kirstie Alley | 0:00<br />Marcus Chong | 1:25<br />Hugo Weaving | 2:43<br />Valerie Harper | 3:53<br />J-Lo | 5:06<br />Jaimee Foxworth | 6:21<br />The Dukes of Hazzard guys | 7:16<br />Tobey Maguire | 8:40<br />Marlon Brando | 9:59<br />Will Smith | 10:59<br />A Simpsons voice actor | 12:08<br />Katherine Heigl | 13:21<br />Tom Cruise | 14:15<br />Daniel Dae Kim and Grace Park | 15:21<br />George Eads and Jorja Fox | 16:33<br />Paris Hilton | 17:28<br /><br />Read Full Article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.looper.com/437204/actors-who-got-greedy-then-got-fired/">https://www.looper.com/437204/actors-who-got-greedy-then-got-fired/</a>{% endraw %}
