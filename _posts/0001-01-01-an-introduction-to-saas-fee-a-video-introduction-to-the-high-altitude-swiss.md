{% raw %}A video introduction to the high-altitude Swiss ski resort of Saas Fee. <br /><br />Located in the Canton Valais and surrounded by dramatic glacial scenery, there is evidence of settlement here since 1304 making Saas Fee one of most historic ski villages in the Alps. <br /><br />Sitting at 1800m, with skiing up to 3600m, the resort has a classic Alpine feel with narrow streets lined with old chalets and traditional barns set on stones. The resort has a great apr√®s ski scene though, from the snow bars near the lifts and through to live music and lively venues in the centre of the village.<br /><br />Saas Fee has a fast-moving property market at the moment with lots of projects in development (or on the horizon) and plenty of attractive, well-priced resale chalets and apartments.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.investorsinproperty.com/resorts/switzerland/saas-fee">https://www.investorsinproperty.com/resorts/switzerland/saas-fee</a>{% endraw %}
