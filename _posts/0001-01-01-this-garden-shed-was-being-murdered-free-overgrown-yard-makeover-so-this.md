{% raw %}So this neglected overgrown yard belongs to one of our long term regular customers, and this corner had been bothering me for years! As you can see, there are bushes growing where there shouldn't be, alongside the shed and through the fence. The lemon tree was healthy, but completely in the wrong spot. I didn't want to remove it, so I just did the best I could to make it manageable. It was a bit of a stormy day down here in Tasmania, as we are heading into winter. The job took us around 2 hours to complete, and we took out around 1 trailer load of green waste.<br /><br />Workers on this job: George (long pants) &amp; Brent (Shorts).<br /><br />See this video without music on my other channel here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/QuickCutsV2">https://www.youtube.com/c/QuickCutsV2</a><br /><br />Support our channel via memberships: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf2ak68stIc-2KCzbMpIlzA/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf2ak68stIc-2KCzbMpIlzA/join</a><br /><br />Support our channel via Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/QCuts">https://www.patreon.com/QCuts</a><br /><br />Find the music we use here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artlist.io/George-2237185">https://artlist.io/George-2237185</a><br /><br />If you enjoy our content, remember to Mow the Like button, throw us a comment and subscribe to our channel for more content like this.<br /><br />Please note that any overly negative comments or bad language directed towards the owner of the property, my workers or myself will be removed.<br /><br />Thanks for watching.....ðŸŒžâœŒðŸ˜Ž<br /><br />Business enquiries: quickcuts.contact@gmail.com<br /><br /><br />FAQ's:<br /><br />Q: Do you worry about snakes?<br />A: I have never even seen a snake in 4 years on the job.<br /><br />Q: Where are you located?<br />A: We are located in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia ðŸ¦˜ðŸ¦˜ðŸ¦˜.<br /><br />Q: Which equipment do you use?<br />A: We use mostly STIHL power equipment (battery and petrol) and commercial Honda self-propelled mowers.<br /><br />Q: How much do the jobs cost?<br />A: Sorry, I prefer not to talk about costs!{% endraw %}
