When the 14-year-old Indian girl cries instead of tears blood comes out. It pours out of her eyes, hairline, palms, and soles of her feet without leaving any wounds, cuts, or scratches. She grows paler and thinner by the day, and neither doctors nor religious speakers can do anything to help her. A lot of people believe that all this might just be an elaborate hoax in order to garner attention but you really can’t tell what’s real and what’s not in this weird and unusual world.<br /><br />Bayzeid Hossain<br /><br />In 2016 a story went viral about Bayzeid Hossain, who is a four-year-old from Southern Bangladesh that suffers from a rare condition that makes him appear to be way older than he actually is. Bayezid is thought to have progeria, a disease that causes the body to age eight times faster than it should. Adding on to his medical condition is a rare connective tissue disorder that causes his skin to fold and hang loosely. When Hossain was born he barely had any flesh to his bones. His parents describe him as being the only skin hanging from bones at the time of his birth.  <br /><br />Bayezid Hossain is unable to lead a normal life, like any other four-year-old, he cannot attend school because of his health issues and since the other children are scared of him, he can’t go and play outside despite Hossain being exceptionally smart. Tripti Khatun, his mother, says she is astounded by how intelligent her son is, but it pains her heart because he has such an unconventional appearance. F Scott Fitzgerald‘s novel “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” is thought to have been inspired by the disease, in which the protagonist is born an elderly man and ages backward.<br /><br />Follow Us On Social Media <br /><br /><br /><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://twitter.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT">https://www.facebook.com/FactsJunkieYT</a><br /><br /><br /><br />► For copyright issues, send us an email at : factsjunkie@gmail.com{% endraw %}
