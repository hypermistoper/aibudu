And without firing a single shot! This country, known as the last dictatorship in Europe, has ended up becoming a puppet of the Kremlin: Russia has troops stationed on its territory and is ready to even install nuclear silos.<br /> <br />However, the gap between Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenka and his citizens is wider than ever. The economic crisis in this country is far more severe than Russia's and the Belarusians have no natural gas or oil to be able to combat economic sanctions. <br /><br />Moreover, unlike Moscow, Minsk does not have an iron grip on its military. The opposition is more organized than ever and has gone so far as to carry out sabotage actions against Russian troops stationed in their country.<br /><br />Is it possible for Belarus to fall out of the Russian sphere of influence? In this video we tell you about it.<br /> <br />Interesting links:<br /> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.israelhayom.com/2022/03/07/defections-and-resignations-in-belarusian-military-prevented-country-from-joining-ukraine-invasion/">https://www.israelhayom.com/2022/03/07/defections-and-resignations-in-belarusian-military-prevented-country-from-joining-ukraine-invasion/</a><br /> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/belarusalert/belarusian-military-reluctant-to-join-vladimir-putins-ukraine-war/">https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/belarusalert/belarusian-military-reluctant-to-join-vladimir-putins-ukraine-war/</a><br /> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/02/belarus-protest-uprising-failure-lukashenko">https://www.jacobinmag.com/2021/02/belarus-protest-uprising-failure-lukashenko</a><br /><br />Join the VisualPolitik community and support us on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/VisualPolitik">https://www.patreon.com/VisualPolitik</a>{% endraw %}
