{% raw %}An F-35 fighter was maneuvering dangerously close to a Russian military aircraft.<br /><br />During a training mission, a group of NATO fighters staged a provocation against a Russian A-50 early warning and control aircraft. According to the data presented, the Norwegian Air Force F-35 fighter approached the Russian military aircraft extremely close, thereby allowing unsafe actions.<br />In the photographs presented, you can see how the Norwegian Air Force fighter allows a strong approach to the Russian airborne early warning and control aircraft.<br />In connection with what exactly the Norwegian pilot decided to get very close to the Russian military aircraft, remains unknown, however, a distance of several hundred meters could well be enough to identify the AWACS board.<br />It is known that no further dangerous actions were allowed by the Norwegian F-35, but the very fact of the provocation arranged by NATO (especially since the route of Russian aircraft ran far from the borders of Norway) indicates that the West is artificially goes to aggravate relations with Russia.{% endraw %}
