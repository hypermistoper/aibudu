{% raw %}Brad Rushing began working with Roger Corman's Concorde/New Horizons film studio which afforded him some of his first feature film opportunities as Director of Photography where he learned valuable skills.<br /><br />After a number of years concentrating on indie feature films Brad began to shoot high end music videos photographing award-winning, iconic clips for artists like Britney Spears, Mariah Carey, Lionel Richie, Nelly and Eminem. Brad's ground-breaking work on Moby's &quot;We Are All Made Of Stars&quot; won an MTV Video Music Award &quot;Moonman&quot; for Best Cinematography in a Video, and many of the other music videos he shot have won awards such as VMAs, MVPAs and Grammys for Best Video. Brad also won a Canadian Society of Cinematographers Award for Best Cinematography in a Video for the Alsou video &quot;Always On My Mind.&quot;<br /><br />Brad's most recent work is the feature film &quot;A California Christmas&quot; which filmed in Petaluma, CA in July 2020, one of the first film productions to start under stringent COVID-19 safety protocols. The film debuted on a major streaming platform for the 2020 holiday season and was number one on Netflix for one week straight.<br /><br />MORE VIDEOS WITH BRAD RUSHING<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3adWlsJ">https://bit.ly/3adWlsJ</a><br /><br />CONNECT WITH BRAD RUSHING<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bradrushing.com">http://www.bradrushing.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0750734">https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0750734</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bradrushingdp">https://www.instagram.com/bradrushingdp</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bradrushing">https://www.facebook.com/bradrushing</a><br /><br />SUPPORT FILM COURAGE BY BECOMING A MEMBER<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs8o1mdWAfefJkdBg632_tg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs8o1mdWAfefJkdBg632_tg/join</a><br /><br />CONNECT WITH FILM COURAGE<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.FilmCourage.com">http://www.FilmCourage.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/#!/FilmCourage">http://twitter.com/#!/FilmCourage</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/filmcourage">https://www.facebook.com/filmcourage</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://filmcourage.tumblr.com">http://filmcourage.tumblr.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://pinterest.com/filmcourage">http://pinterest.com/filmcourage</a><br /><br />BUSINESS INQUIRIES<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/22M0Va2">http://bit.ly/22M0Va2</a><br /><br />SUBSCRIBE TO THE FILM COURAGE YOUTUBE CHANNEL<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/18DPN37">http://bit.ly/18DPN37</a><br /><br />LISTEN TO THE FILM COURAGE PODCAST<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/filmcourage-com">https://soundcloud.com/filmcourage-com</a><br /><br />PROMOTE YOUR MOVIE, WEBSERIES, OR PRODUCT ON FILM COURAGE<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1nnJkgm">http://bit.ly/1nnJkgm</a><br /><br />Stuff we use:<br />CAMERA - This is the camera we have used to film 90+% of our interviews (over 200 interviews and counting)  It continues to be our workhorse - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2u66V1J">http://amzn.to/2u66V1J</a><br /><br />LENS - Most people ask us what camera we use, no one ever asks about the lens which filmmakers always tell us is more important.  This lens was a big investment for us and one we wish we could have made sooner.  Started using this lens at the end of 2013 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://amzn.to/2tbtmOq">http://amzn.to/2tbtmOq</a><br /><br />AUDIO <br /><br />Rode VideoMic Pro  - The Rode mic helps us capture our backup audio.
