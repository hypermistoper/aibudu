{% raw %}At approximately 17:21, units from Bobo, Toney, Harvest, and Hazel Green Volunteer Fire Departments were dispatched to a structure fire in the 1200 block of Macedonia Rd. in Bobo's first due. First arriving units on scene reported a heavily involved trailer that had extended into a garage on the Bravo side of the structure. <br /><br />The structure had burned twice in the months previous, but crews attempted to make a push for a search before being pulled out due to structural collapse. Crews operated on scene for roughly 3 hours, and the fire is currently under investigation for possible arson.{% endraw %}
