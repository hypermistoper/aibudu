{% raw %}In Alberta, women's health research receives only 3.4% of provincial health research funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR). A year ago today, the Alberta Women’s Health Foundation (AWHF) was launched with a goal to achieve funding equality. We've helped and given a voice to women across Alberta. <br /><br />Help us on our mission to #BreakTheBias, build awareness and raise funds for women's health research by sharing your story today: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.royalalex.org/lois-hole-hospital-for-women/awhf-iwd-story-submissions">https://www.royalalex.org/lois-hole-hospital-for-women/awhf-iwd-story-submissions</a><br /><br />Please follow the Alberta Women’s Health Foundation<br />- Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.albertawomenshealthfounda...">https://www.albertawomenshealthfounda...</a><br />- Facebook: @abwomenshealthfoundation<br />- Twitter: @abwomenshealth<br />- Instagram: @abwomenshealthfoundation<br />- LinkedIn: Alberta Women’s Health Foundation{% endraw %}
