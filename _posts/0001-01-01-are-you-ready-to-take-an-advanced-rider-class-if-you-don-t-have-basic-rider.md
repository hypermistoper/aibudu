{% raw %}If you don't have basic rider skills, don't even think about taking an advanced rider class.  It can become extremely frustrating and counter-productive.  If you're having trouble at low speeds, practice the slow race at a walking pace while in the friction zone and have a little pressure on the rear brake and Keep your head and eyes up.  You need to be able to do this exercise easily without putting a foot down before even thinking about taking an advanced class.  <br />For more information on our classes, locations, dvds, book, thumb-drive, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ridelikeapro.com">https://www.ridelikeapro.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ridelikeapro.com/rider-classes/">https://www.ridelikeapro.com/rider-classes/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ridelikeapro.com/training-locations/">https://www.ridelikeapro.com/training-locations/</a><br />Don't forget to check out our son Tony's new YouTube Channel called Leo Rides.
