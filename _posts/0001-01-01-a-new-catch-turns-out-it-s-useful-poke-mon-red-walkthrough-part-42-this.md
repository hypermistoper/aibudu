{% raw %}This is the forty second episode of my playthrough of Pokemon Red! In this episode we catch a new Pokemon! It's a Voltorb! And turns out it comes in handy later in the episode when we reach the Rock Tunnel and have to use HM05 Flash to light it up. We also train our Charmeleon while battling some new trainers.<br /><br />Welcome to the 365 Seb channel here on YouTube. On this channel I'm going to play through a game from my childhood, Pokemon Red, starting 1st January 2017. I'll be uploading a new video every single day of the entire year.
