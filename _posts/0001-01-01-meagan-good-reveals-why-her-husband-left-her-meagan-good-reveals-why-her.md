{% raw %}Meagan Good Reveals Why Her Husband Left Her<br /><br />Meagan Good and Devon Franklin are divorcing after NINE years of marriage and Megan has finally revealed why Devon left her, and the reason is going to break your heart. <br /><br />After nine years of marriage, Meagan Good and her husband Devon Franklin are now calling it quits and they are getting a divorce. I’m not going to lie, this one kind of hurts because I really thought that they were one of the few couples that were actually going to last forever. Hollywood doesn’t have a lot of long-term marriages, but I just kind of felt like this was going to be one of the few exceptions, you know?<br /><br />They were together for nine years, and they never had any scandal or anything of the sort, which is super rare for two people who are in the entertainment industry. I mean, even Beyonce and Jay Z have had more than their fair share of public drama and scandal, so it is really impressive that Meagan and Devon managed nine years with no messy drama.<br /><br />#meagangood #devonfranklin{% endraw %}
