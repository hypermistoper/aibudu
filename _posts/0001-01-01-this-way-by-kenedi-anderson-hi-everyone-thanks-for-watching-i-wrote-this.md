{% raw %}Hi everyone! Thanks for watching :) I wrote this song shortly after I turned 17 about growing up and wanting to stay who I am. I also want to say that I know this isn’t perfect and I personally struggle with letting myself be ok with making mistakes vocally and otherwise, but I think it’s important for me to post things even when they’re not exactly how I want them to be because that’s a big step for me in accepting my flaws. :) Hopefully the emotion and message of my song speaks louder than the exact notes I’m singing. Love you all{% endraw %}
