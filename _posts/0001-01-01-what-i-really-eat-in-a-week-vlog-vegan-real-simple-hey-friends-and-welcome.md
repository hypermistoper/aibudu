Not every day is perfect, balanced or nourishing, but this is life and that is okay. We tend to think we can or should eat exactly the same everyday to be ‚Äú healthy‚Äù to feel ‚Äúaccomplished‚Äù  and that is self love. But the reality is everyday is a new day and with a new day comes different emotions, life events etc‚Ä¶ The goal should never be ‚Äúperfection‚Äù, it should be to show yourself love and kindness everyday, never giving up on yourself and putting your energy into at least one thing that makes you feel you‚Äôre best! <br /><br />As always I‚Äôm sending so much love!<br /><br /> Last weeks ‚Äúwhat I eat in a week‚Äù video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/V_kX8QoLu88">https://youtu.be/V_kX8QoLu88</a><br />( granola recipe + mushroom rice recipe )<br /><br />matcha I use: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://matcha.com/collections/tea/products/tenchi-ceremonial-organic">https://matcha.com/collections/tea/products/tenchi-ceremonial-organic</a> <br />you can use JULIA for 20% off your first purchase! <br /><br />Hojicha Tea Powder - Organic Roasted Hojicha Powder:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://matcha.com/collections/japanese-farm-direct-tea/products/hojicha-tea-powder-organic-roasted-hojicha-powder-1">https://matcha.com/collections/japanese-farm-direct-tea/products/hojicha-tea-powder-organic-roasted-hojicha-powder-1</a><br /><br />Soup recipe:<br />1 tbsp oil<br />1/4 large onion<br />1 carrot <br />3 cups mushrooms<br />2&quot; ginger ( minced )<br />4 cloves garlic ( minced )<br />3/4 cup cashews ( soaked for 20 minutes than blended with 3 cups water )<br />salt and pepper to taste ( more than you think!! )<br />1 tsp chilli flakes ( or to taste )<br />1 cup tamarind sauce ( 3 tbsp tamarind paste + 2 cups  hot water mixed really well )<br />3 cups water<br />2 tsp coriander<br />1/3 cup fresh basil ( roughly chopped )<br />6-7 baby bokchoy <br />1.5 cups butter beans <br />rice noodles ( only cook how much you will eat right away! )<br /><br />Soak cashews in hot water for about 20 minutes and chop veggies<br /><br />Saut√© onion, carrot, mushroom, ginger and garlic in 1 tbsp oil.
