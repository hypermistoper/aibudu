I really like talking about these things and learning how other people handle their finances. I've made a similar video before, but I've made some changes and upgrades. My new finance system has 5 components: (1) Architecture, (2) Cashflow, (3) Investments, (4) Net Worth, and the (5) Cherries. The apps that I use are Notion, Wallet by Budget Bakers, Google Sheets, and Google Calendar. I'll be discussing them more in the video.<br /><br />I like to simplify things because my brain hates hard, complicated topics, so I'll also talk about the imaginary money world I made in my head. It's important to create a plan for your money and give every single peso you own a job. This is how money moves through my system: (1) Income, (2) Save, (3) Invest, (4) Spend 🚂<br /><br />Personal finance doesn't need to be complicated. When it comes to learning how to manage your money, you just need to find the system that works for you. If you have big goals, make sure you have a system that can help you achieve them! This is what works for me and I'm hoping that you'll learn something from this video. Thanks for watching! 😄🍞<br /><br />- My Old Money System (2020) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/PiNlVlF1BdI">https://youtu.be/PiNlVlF1BdI</a><br />- Thea Sy Bautista's Budget Template <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/7kR9Ko0BYUI">https://youtu.be/7kR9Ko0BYUI</a><br /><br />➜ Enjoy your free money 💰⬇️<br /><br />🏦 Banks &amp; E-Wallets<br />- Unionbank PlayEveryday: Use “UBNOW-NA0920016”  to get 300 PlayPoints<br />- Tonik: Get ₱60 with “T42BHJL” when you sign-up, verify, and top-up<br />- GCash: Get ₱50 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2ZyrLWy">https://bit.ly/2ZyrLWy</a>  when you sign-up, verify, and cash-in<br />- PayMaya: Get Php100 when you use “2Y817PZMN84O” or sign up and verify at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2ZzVjTs">https://bit.ly/2ZzVjTs</a><br /><br />🚀 Crypto Platforms<br />- Crypto.com: Get $25 in CRO when you sign-up at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://crypto.com/app/nicolealba">https://crypto.com/app/nicolealba</a> or use my code &quot;nicolealba&quot; 😁<br />- BlockFi: Get $10 in Bitcoin when you sign-up at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3jWct5a">https://bit.ly/3jWct5a</a> and deposit at least $100<br />- Celsius: Get $50 in Bitcoin when you sign-up at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/30luMcO">https://bit.ly/30luMcO</a> or use code “119827e588” and deposit at least $400<br />- Binance: Sign-up and get 10% discount on fees <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Nicole-Binance">https://bit.ly/Nicole-Binance</a> or use code &quot;YBY3MNM9&quot;<br />- PDAX: Use “nicole” to get ₱30 when you deposit a minimum of ₱1,000<br /><br />💵 More Cash<br />- GoTrade: Use invite code “157655” to Invest in US Stocks and ETFs for as low as $1<br />- Citibank Rewards CC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3mNSB5J">https://bit.ly/3mNSB5J</a><br />- Citibank Simplicity CC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3jWv6FQ">https://bit.ly/3jWv6FQ</a><br />- ShopBack: Get ₱100 at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/nicoleshopback">http://bit.ly/nicoleshopback</a><br /><br />➜ If you're reading this, comment &quot;I like cherries 🍒&quot; below!
