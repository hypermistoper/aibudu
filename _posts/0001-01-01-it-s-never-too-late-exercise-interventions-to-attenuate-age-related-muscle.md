{% raw %}Invited Session at ECSS Vienna 2016 &quot;Strategies to combat sarcopenia&quot; <br /><br />It’s never too late – exercise interventions to attenuate age-related muscle loss<br />Wessner, B.<br />University of Vienna<br /><br />Sarcopenia as defined by the European Working Group on Sarcopenia in Older People is characterized by the age-related loss of muscle mass, strength and function [1]. In order to stay physically (and mentally) fit and healthy, exercise training (aerobic, muscle strengthening, balance and flexibility training) is suggested for older adults [2]. Especially, resistance training has been proven to effectively increase muscle mass, strength and function even at a higher age, whereby an intensity progression from about 40% to<br />80% of the individual one repetition maximum is suggested when starting an exercise program [3] indicating that high intensities<br />would be needed to induce substantial gains in muscle strength and mass. However, a previous meta-analysis has shown that<br />resistance training at lower than traditionally recommended intensities is also effective, when a sufficient number of repetitions is performed [4]. Besides the classical resistance training other training modalities (vibration training, elastic-band resistance training, concurrent training …) will be discussed with respect to their effectiveness to prevent or combat sarcopenia. <br /><br />1.
