{% raw %}In this video we’ll be going over the top 10 fastest zones to level in, meaning zones that give the most xp for the amount of time spent inside of them. Technically, almost all of the WoD zones are the fastest zones in which to level, but that would make for a very boring top 10 list, and WoD only has 7 zones anyways, so we’re going to mix it up a bit for those speed levelers who are sick and tired of leveling in WoD over and over and over again. <br /><br />Video managed by Felplague<br />Video edited by Splitrift<br /><br /><br />--The List--<br />Intro: (0:00)<br />10) Hellfire Peninsula: (0:22)<br />9) Ashenvale: (3:13)<br />8) Hillsbrad Foothills: (4:51)<br />7) Westfall : (6:47)<br />6) Talador: (8:18)<br />5) Northern Stranglethorn Vale: (9:35)<br />4) Elwynn Forest: (10:47)<br />3) Highmountain: (12:01)<br />2) Silverpine Forest: (13:51)<br />1) Shadowmoon Valley (WoD): (15:43)<br /><br />-Music as it Appears-<br />British Royalty - Trailer Worx<br />Arietta Op. 12 Nr. 1 - Traditional<br />Ciel - Arden Forest<br />Legato - Ever So Blue<br />Theme for Autumn - Franz Gordon<br />Ballad for Olivia - Eneide<br />Curses - Martin Gauffin<br />Felt Like November - Magnus Ludvigsson<br />Prelude In C Major (BWV 846) (Piano Version) - Traditional<br /><br />-- Subscribe to my other channel, The DuelLogs, if you like YuGiOh. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDuelLogs">https://www.youtube.com/user/TheDuelLogs</a> <br />-- Subscribe to my other channel, TheD&amp;DLogs, if you like Dungeons and Dragons. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDDLogs">https://www.youtube.com/c/TheDDLogs</a><br /><br />-- Check out some of my Amazon favorites like what I use to run my YouTube channels, my home gym essentials, and other random stuff I like to buy. www.amazon.com/shop/hirumaredx <br /><br /><br />--Social Media--<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/hirumared">https://twitter.com/hirumared</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Hirumaredx">https://www.facebook.com/Hirumaredx</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/hirumaredx">http://www.patreon.com/hirumaredx</a><br /><br />- #WoW #WorldofWarcraft #warcraft{% endraw %}
