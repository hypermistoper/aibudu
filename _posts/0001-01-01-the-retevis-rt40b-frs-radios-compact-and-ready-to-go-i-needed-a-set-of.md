{% raw %}I needed a set of cheap FRS radios for an upcoming trip. When Retevis asked if I'd be interested in reviewing these, It was a perfect fit. <br />  They are compact, simple to use, and have two ways to recharge. What more could I ask for?<br /><br />If you'd like a set, here are some links:<br />4pack: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095LMS732?ref=myi_title_dp">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095LMS732?ref=myi_title_dp</a><br />10pack: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095LMD8VZ?ref=myi_title_dp">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095LMD8VZ?ref=myi_title_dp</a><br /><br />Buy Farpoint Farms Shirts, Mugs, and Stickers Here:<br />Teespring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://farpoint-farms-4.myteespring.co/">https://farpoint-farms-4.myteespring.co/</a><br /><br />Like The Channel?
