{% raw %}When I got this cabinet, almost everything wanted to  fall apart.  In this video you will see, how I fix this Art Noveau cabinet. <br /><br />This piece was made around 1910-1930 period, in Estonia. It doesnÂ´t have fancy details. Only the glass section hints, that this was made in Art Noveau period. Originally they had only clear coat, but my client wanted darker version, so I had to stain it. Some versions of this cabinet had Art Noveau style carvings on the doors.<br /><br />T-shirts and other stuff:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://at-store-25.creator-spring.com/">https://at-store-25.creator-spring.com/</a><br />My music channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/TotuCool/videos">https://www.youtube.com/c/TotuCool/videos</a><br />AT Restoration Plus channel:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjjxMSJTfAR3IbCAT25-MbA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjjxMSJTfAR3IbCAT25-MbA</a><br /><br /><br />#howtorestorefurniture #howto  #howtorestore<br />Song: &quot;Lakey Inspired - Blue Boi [Lofi]&quot; is under a Creative Commons (CC BY-SA 3.0) license.<br />Music promoted by BreakingCopyright: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/wnOoqdcf7zU">https://youtu.be/wnOoqdcf7zU</a>{% endraw %}
