{% raw %}&quot;OMG if you travel with more than $10,000 you're going to get arrested and put in jail like John Gotti! Bro, you know that's how they got Al Capone, right???&quot; <br /><br />This is yet another one of those asinine suppositions people incorrectly make after watching far too many movies. Most of the people that will give you their expert opinion on carrying fat knots of cash have never actually had $10,000 in their possession at any given time. <br /><br />Teaching English abroad I was fortunate to be able to have the problem of needing to deal with this amount of cash on a few occasions. It is not the smartest thing to do and you need to obviously be very careful about transportation of large sums of money, but it's not illegal as many would have you believe. It can definitely be a PAIN... but if you have dealt with the banking systems in developing countries without great infrastructure and questionable practices before, you know what I'm talking about when I'm saying that sometimes it's better to take your earnings out in Sterling, USD, Loonies, Euros, or what have you. <br /><br />Lastly, don't be the idiot ESL teacher who risks getting caught trying to evade taxes when he shouldn't legally owe any taxes anyway. Yes, (facepalm), I've seen this.<br /> <br />***************************************************************<br />ðŸ¥‡WORK WITH BEN and CO â–¶ï¸Ž<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.benteachesenglishoverseas.com">http://www.benteachesenglishoverseas.com</a><br /><br />ðŸŽ¥ LET'S TALK: BOOK A CALL â–¶ï¸Ž  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://booking.appointy.com/BTEO">https://booking.appointy.com/BTEO</a><br /><br />ðŸ’° 5% RETURN ON YOUR CASH â–¶ï¸Ž <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://worthybonds.com/?r=QbDUL">https://worthybonds.com/?r=QbDUL</a><br /><br />ðŸ“• MY FAVORITE #1 BOOK FOR ESL (ALL LEVELS) â–¶ï¸Ž <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2DvLoCU">https://amzn.to/2DvLoCU</a><br /><br />ðŸ“˜ BEST PERSONAL FINANCE BOOK OF ALL TIME â–¶ï¸Ž <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/39NIR8b">https://amzn.to/39NIR8b</a><br /><br />ðŸ“œ DISCOUNTED 120 HOUR FAST TEFL CERT â–¶ï¸Ž<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.teflcourse.net/apply/?cu=PMDLW2019B">https://www.teflcourse.net/apply/?cu=PMDLW2019B</a><br /><br />ðŸ“—FREE BOOKLET &quot;The Big 6&quot; AND BLOG â–¶ï¸Ž <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.benteachesenglishoverseas.com/blog">http://www.benteachesenglishoverseas.com/blog</a><br /><br /><br />ðŸ”» FOLLOW ME ON SOCIAL MEDIAðŸ”»<br /><br />ðŸ”µ FACEBOOK | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/benteachesenglishoverseas">http://facebook.com/benteachesenglishoverseas</a><br /><br />âœ… INSTAGRAM | <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/benteachesenglishoverseas">http://instagram.com/benteachesenglishoverseas</a>{% endraw %}
