{% raw %}EDIT to add the business name:  Lone Star Skoolie Conversions.  I left that out at first, but after seeing 3 of these builds in person and speaking with over a dozen of their &quot;victims&quot;, I no longer have reservations about sharing that.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />The owners of this bus paid a Texas skoolie business about $45,000 for this custom conversion.  And, frankly, the quality of the work is just crap.  Besides being poor quality and not well executed, there are serious safety issues.   Electrical shock hazard? Electrical fire hazard? Wood stove fire hazard?  Yes, to all of these.<br /><br />I show you the resulting work, and the serious safety problems, so that you can hopefully learn a few things from it.{% endraw %}
