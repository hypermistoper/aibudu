After a rough start to his 2021 season after tearing his ACL and breaking his scaphoid, Jeremy quickly jumped back on his Partymaster V2 and started stacking some buttery bicycle stunts in the streets of Ottawa. Super happy how this one came together, safe to say the video speaks for itself.<br /><br />See Jeremy's Bikecheck: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://the-rise.com/blogs/news/bikecheck-jeremy-mendunis-partymaster-v2">https://the-rise.com/blogs/news/bikecheck-jeremy-mendunis-partymaster-v2</a><br /><br /><br />Follow The Rise MTB:<br /><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/therisemtb​">http://www.facebook.com/therisemtb​</a><br /><br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/therisedotcom">http://instagram.com/therisedotcom</a><br /><br />SHOP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://shop.the-rise.com">http://shop.the-rise.com</a>{% endraw %}
