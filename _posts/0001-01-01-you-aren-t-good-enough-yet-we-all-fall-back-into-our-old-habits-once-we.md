{% raw %}We all fall back into our old habits once we see a tidbit of improvement in our lives. We lose our humility and become complacent. Comfort is the killer of man and this is what holds you back in your journey to leave a legacy behind. You need to keep reminding yourself that you aren't good enough yet and that there's a lot of work to be done. Don't be Jeffrey. Don't be arrogant.<br /><br />💬 Let me know what you think of this video in the comment section below.<br /><br />I appreciate every thumb up and would love it if you’d consider subscribing to the channel!<br />👉 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/Hamza97/?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/Hamza97/?sub_confirmation=1</a>  <br />Thank you for visiting 👋<br /> <br />********************<br />🏆 Welcome to the official YouTube channel of Hamza Ahmed 🏆<br /> <br />Young men, naturally have many questions about who they are, where they fit in to the grand scheme of things.<br />➡️ If you’re interested in learning about topics such as masculinity, success, fitness, and mental health you’ve come to a good place.<br />I’ve been working on building a great community here (and also on my Discord server) to share advice on helping men become balanced, form healthy relationships, achieve their goals, and live healthy lives.<br /><br />I was unhealthy, unbalanced, and somewhat hedonistic.<br />➡️ It took a lot of hard work and mindfulness, but I eventually turned my life around.<br />I’m currently sharing the specific actions I took to make positive changes, one video at a time.<br /><br />Definitely subscribe to my channel and hit the bell to never miss a video 🔔 <br /><br />********************<br />✔️ Who am I?<br />I'm Hamza. My purpose in life is to make more men like Adonis.<br />I make videos on masculinity, success, fitness &amp; mental health as well as other areas of life that aid you in your journey from Jeffery to Adonis.<br /><br />✔️ My Story:<br />I went from being the awkward, skinny fat video gamer in high school to the party kid in university.  I was doing all the bad habits (can you guess what they were?)<br />Living a life of pleasure had poisonous effects on my mental and physical health. <br />It took me a while to get on the right track, I had to leave everything behind and start a new life, with a new mission.<br /><br />********************<br />👍 Let’s Connect!
