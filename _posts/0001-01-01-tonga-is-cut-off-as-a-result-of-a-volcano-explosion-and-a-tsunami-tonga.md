{% raw %}Tonga is cut off as a result of a volcano explosion and a tsunami.<br />Tsunami-hit Tonga remained mostly uncontactable on Sunday, with phone and internet connections cut, leaving relatives in remote New Zealand praying for their kin on the Pacific islands as fatality reports were still coming in, according to Reuters.<br />An undersea volcano off the coast of Tonga erupted on Saturday, causing 1.2-meter tsunami warnings and evacuation orders on the coastlines of Tonga and numerous South Pacific islands, with pictures on social media showing waves slamming into coastal houses.<br />On Saturday about 6.40 p.m. local time, internet and phone connections fell down, rendering the 105,000 inhabitants on the islands essentially uncontactable.<br />There have been no official reports of injuries or fatalities in Tonga as of yet, however communications are restricted and contact with coastal regions outside the capital, Nuku'alofa, has yet to be made, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said at a press conference on Sunday.<br />Tonga, an island country of around 105,000 people, is located 2,383 kilometers (1,481 miles) northeast of New Zealand.<br />On Saturday, satellite photographs showed the volcanic eruption, which propelled plumes of smoke into the air nearly 12 miles above sea level. The ash has clouded the sky above Tonga.<br />According to Ardern, the primary underwater communications cable has been damaged, most likely due to a power outage.<br />She noted that power was being restored in certain portions of the islands and that local cell phones were gradually resuming service.<br />She said that official damage estimates were not yet available. However, Ardern said that the New Zealand high commission in Nuku'alofa reported that the tsunami destroyed boats, businesses, and other infrastructure.<br />Summarizer:<br />Tonga remained largely uncontactable on Sunday with telephone and internet links severed. Underwater volcano off Tonga triggered warnings of 1.2-meter tsunami waves and evacuation orders. Internet and phone lines went down at about 6.40 p.m. local time on Saturday leaving the 105,000 residents virtually contactable. No official reports of injuries or deaths in Tonga as yet although communications are limited.<br />================<br />Thank you for watching!<br />please subscribe to my channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/fQvbx1">https://goo.gl/fQvbx1</a><br />Any feedback, Don't hesitate to comment.{% endraw %}
