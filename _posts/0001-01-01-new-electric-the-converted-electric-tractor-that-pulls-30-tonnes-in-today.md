{% raw %}In today’s Fully Charged PLUS episode Robert speaks with New Electric founder Anne Kloppenberg about their 100% fully electric tractor conversion.<br /><br />We featured this impressive vehicle briefly back in October 2021 on the main channel as part of Robert’s ‘Return of the Leaf’ episode, but we felt we’d share a bigger piece here on PLUS. The tractor has had the diesel engine, gearbox and transmission removed and is now 100% electric. Battery packs replace the area the diesel engine was housed in, and with 2 motors joined together by one gearbox, they have created double the power, up to 150 KW maximum. The tractor was designed to tow huge trailers full of building material around building sites in central Amsterdam where all combustion engines are soon to be banned.<br /><br />Become a Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/fullychargedshow">https://www.patreon.com/fullychargedshow</a><br />Become a YouTube member: use JOIN button above<br />Subscribe to Fully Charged &amp; the Fully Charged PLUS channels <br />Buy the Fully Charged Guide to Electric Vehicles &amp; Clean Energy : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://buff.ly/2GybGt0">https://buff.ly/2GybGt0</a><br /><br />Browse the Fully Charged store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.fullycharged.show/">https://shop.fullycharged.show/</a><br />Visit our LIVE exhibitions in the UK, USA &amp; Europe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://FullyCharged.Show/events">https://FullyCharged.Show/events</a><br />Subscribe for episode alerts and the Fully Charged newsletter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fullycharged.show/zap-sign-up/">https://fullycharged.show/zap-sign-up/</a><br />Visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://FullyCharged.Show">https://FullyCharged.Show</a><br />Find us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/fullychargedshw">https://twitter.com/fullychargedshw</a><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/fullychargedshow">https://instagram.com/fullychargedshow</a><br /><br />#electrictractor #electricagriculture #NewElectric #batteries #electricvehicles{% endraw %}
