{% raw %}We took a trip into the welsh Valleys to visit Abie Danters Funfair in Aberdare, Wales . Lovely little venue for a funfair and a great little line up. The fair showed a few effect of the recent storms but it didnt effect to rides too much with Abie Danters Waltzer giving great cycles , Stuart danters brilliant 6 arm extreme , William Henry Clarks stunning Kick Down freak out , his sonocase Twister and Stuarts Insania Miami. Great Fair that now moves on to Llanelli opening on March 9th.{% endraw %}
