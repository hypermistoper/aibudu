{% raw %}If you would like to support my journey my cash app is $lalafranz. PayPal: contactlauric@gmail.com.<br /><br /><br />In this video, I will be sharing the financial struggles I have faced since repatriating to Africa. I currently have no money in a foreign country. I wanted to be fully transparent with my viewers about real life challenges one may face when moving to another continent. <br /><br />Thanks for watching! ðŸ˜Š<br /><br /><br />This video was shot approximately 2-3 weeks ago. I wanted to share my entire journey and keep it real with my viewers. Repatriation is not easy. Life is not easy. I go through ups and downs just like everyone else. I'm sharing my truth so I can later navigate people through my failures. Failures are what paves our way to success. If I didn't fail I wouldn't know how to help others how to avoid it. When I say I am a pioneer it means I am not afraid of falling after putting myself on the front line. I have faith that things will completely turn around for me and I am excited for what god has in store for me! <br /><br />In my next video, I will give everyone an update on how things are going since I shot this video  and how I'm navigating my way through financial struggles in a foreign country. Stay tuned!<br /><br />Contact Info: contactlauric@gmail.com<br /><br />Instagram: www.Instagram.com/<br />journeywithLaLa<br /><br />#tanzania#transparency#singlemother #struggles#financialstruggles#broke <br />#africa#repatriation#reallife{% endraw %}
