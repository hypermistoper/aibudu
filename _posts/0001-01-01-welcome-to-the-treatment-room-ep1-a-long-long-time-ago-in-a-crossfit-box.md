{% raw %}A long, long time ago in a CrossFit box far, far away, three cocks on a couch sat and talked mostly about themselves, how they got into the world of fitness and what it takes to be kind of average at your job...luckily these three heroes are pretty good at what they do and you get to hear how they made there way into the fitness industry instead...I mean how well do you know your coach?<br /><br />Well, have a watch to find out more.<br /><br />Adam, Matt and Sam introduce themselves, talk about how they got into the world of fitness and a little on what fitness mens to them. <br /><br />You can follow them all on instagram:<br />@adamblackwellpt<br />@crossfitfareham<br />@harlow_health_and _fitness{% endraw %}
