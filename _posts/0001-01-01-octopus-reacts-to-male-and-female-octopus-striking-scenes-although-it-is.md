{% raw %}Although it is a well-known fact that most octopus species are not social creatures, it is always fascinating watching them interact with one another. <br />We set up the observation tank with a see-through plastic divider in the middle that allowed some physical contact to take place through the safety of a small hole in the middle. <br />We chose Rudy for this experiment as he is always friendly (at least with us) and ready to take on any challenge. We allowed Rudy to interact with Roxanne (a female) and Pete (a male) for a short time during the course of three consecutive days. <br />It was very interesting to see if there was some kind of behavioral pattern describing each encounter and to watch their relationship develop through time.  <br />We hope you will find their reactions as interesting as we did.{% endraw %}
