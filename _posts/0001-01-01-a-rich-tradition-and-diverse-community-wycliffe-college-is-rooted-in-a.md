{% raw %}Wycliffe College is rooted in a rich evangelical Anglican tradition with a strong Biblical foundation that upholds the values of the Reformation. <br />But most of all it's a school that welcomes a diverse group of students from a wide variety of Christian traditions and cultural origins into it's close-knit community. As we learn together, pray together, eat together and serve together we strive to honor Christ and his Church in all we do.{% endraw %}
