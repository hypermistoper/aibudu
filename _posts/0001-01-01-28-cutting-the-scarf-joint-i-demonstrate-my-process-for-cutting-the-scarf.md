{% raw %}I demonstrate my process for cutting the scarf joint for the headstock. The joint can a tricky one for some! This determines the headstock angle. Fine prep work is necessary to get this joint right.<br />I mark and cut the angle freehand on the bandsaw. Then I smooth and manage the skew of the joint with a blockplane and progressively finer grits of sandpaper.<br /><br />Join The Online Guitar Building School at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ericschaeferguitars.com/course/building-an-om-acoustic/">http://www.ericschaeferguitars.com/course/building-an-om-acoustic/</a><br />- Over 30 hours of detailed video instruction<br />- Discounts to Stewart Macdonald and Luthier's Mercantile International<br />- Access to the Member's Forum{% endraw %}
