{% raw %}In the first clip you see that this little Saturday afternoon a Cuterebra Removed to help this bunny feel better. 2nd clip is where you need to keep watching for video footage of Milo in the underwater treadmill! Milo visits us for regular sessions with Dr. Heatly to maintain his range of motion and muscle strength after his previous orthopedic surgery as a puppy. Water treadmill therapy is primarily used in veterinary patients to improve muscle strength after limb, neck, or back surgery or injury and improve range of motion in compromised joints. It is also becoming more frequently used in working animals for athletic conditioning, weight management, and neurological conditions. Water treadmill therapy provides a reduced weight-bearing environment that increases functional use of a limb without significant weight loading and discomfort to a postsurgical joint or arthritic joint. Feel free to stop by for a quick tour or give us a call if you think your pet may benefit from water treadmill therapy!<br /><br />See more great pleins veterinary service here:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/greatplainsvet/">https://www.facebook.com/greatplainsvet/</a><br /><br />Note: All Videos Here On This Channel Have Been Allowed To Be Uploaded On It(except Commentary, it's Original And Added By Me With My Own Voice)<br /><br />Love Animals?
