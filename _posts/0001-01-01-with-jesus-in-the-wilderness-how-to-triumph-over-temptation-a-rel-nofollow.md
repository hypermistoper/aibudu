We are a vibrant, family-friendly, Gospel-centered church in Des Moines, Iowa. We would love to have you join us for one of our Sunday services, connect through our online resources or check out our latest teaching and preaching. We believe God gives His church a clear mandate in Scripture: to glorify Him by helping people become increasingly devoted followers of Jesus Christ. We want to see that take place at Saylorville Church, in our local community, in the Des Moines metro and all around the world.<br /><br /><br /><br />Saylorville Church is a bible-based, Gospel loving church. We believe that the contents of Holy Bible have been given to mankind from God, and that the Bible contains no error. God’s intention for giving us the Bible, is to tell us ALL we need to know about: our triune God; how the universe was made; why we were made; how we should live; why suffering and evil exist; what happens after we die; and how we can come into a personal relationship with God through His Son Jesus Christ (the Gospel).<br /><br /><br /><br />Please visit our website for more information about the Gospel and our church -<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.saylorvillechurch.com/.">http://www.saylorvillechurch.com/.</a> <br /><br />Text us or email us if you have any questions 515-999-6429; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.saylorvillechurch.com/contact/contact-us/">http://www.saylorvillechurch.com/contact/contact-us/</a> <br /><br />Stop by and say hi.
