{% raw %}Yummy desserts and snacks you can make at home<br /><br />Hello friends! Today we decided to post something unusual... We will cook together with you guys :) We will make with you a fantastic chocolate dessert like professionals! First of all, get some cacao powder or grated chocolate to decorate the plate. Then get a balloon and dip it into melted chocolate. Put the balloon in the freezer, and let the chocolate harden for a couple of minutes. <br />Take out the balloon and pop it! Now we have a beautiful chocolate plate :) Put your favorite ice cream inside of it (we recommend you use different flavors and colors to make it look even more yummy and colorful). We also have an excellent decor idea for your dessert! Use a glass of cold water to create a unique chocolate decor and put it on top ;) You can also add some berries or your favorite syrup.<br />Stay tuned, we will show you how to get ready for a party and decorate your table with delicious snacks. Also, if you bought a boring cake and want to decorate it yourself, watch the video till the end to see our tutorial on how to make your cake look amazing :)<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />00:01 - Yummy chocolate dessert recipe<br />03:03 - Amazing festive table with snacks<br /> 06:11 - How to decorate a cake<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Our Social Media:<br /><br /><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/5min.crafts/">https://www.facebook.com/5min.crafts/</a><br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/5.min.crafts/">https://www.instagram.com/5.min.crafts/</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/5m_crafts">https://twitter.com/5m_crafts</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Subscribe to 5-Minute Crafts GIRLY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/fWbJqz">https://goo.gl/fWbJqz</a><br /><br />Subscribe to 5-Minute Crafts KIDS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/PEuLVt">https://goo.gl/PEuLVt</a><br /><br />Subscribe to 5-Minute Crafts MEN: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2S69VUG">http://bit.ly/2S69VUG</a><br /><br /><br /><br />The Bright Side of Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br /><br /><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me">http://www.brightside.me</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a>{% endraw %}
