{% raw %}13 years ago English Heritage and Dover Castle decided to fill some of the rooms with artefacts and decoration that would or could have been around when it was built in 1188.  I had a large part in making artefacts for this project and so every year since, I come back to clean and renovate my work, and have continued to make the odd piece for them.<br /><br />As part of this I made the volunteers a display bow about maille making so they could talk the visitors through the process of how and why maille was made.  This short simply talks you through some of the talk that they give.<br /><br />Does wax on arrow heads do anything? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/oC30A6noRmY">https://youtu.be/oC30A6noRmY</a><br /><br />Channel 4 documentary  on Dover Castle <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/VlHnG1dNppA">https://youtu.be/VlHnG1dNppA</a><br /><br />Many thanks to Dover Castle and English Heritage for letting me film here.<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/v...">https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/v...</a><br /><br />Production replica weapons are available here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://todcutler.com​​">https://todcutler.com​​</a><br />And T shirts and Merch todsworkshop.creator-spring.com<br />Custom pieces are available here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://todsworkshop.com">https://todsworkshop.com</a>{% endraw %}
