The Apple store is located at one end of the upscale Leidseplein, a square at the south side of Amsterdam’s centre.<br /><br />The Netherlands’ biggest city saw a spate of four armed robberies of mobile phone stores in 2021, prompting some stores to remove most of their phone supplies, which were being targeted. None of the robberies had been in the city centre however. Gun violence is not uncommon in the Netherlands, but hostage takings are extremely rare. In 2015 a man with a gun broke into a TV studio demanding screen time. No one was injured and the man was later convicted of hostage taking.{% endraw %}
