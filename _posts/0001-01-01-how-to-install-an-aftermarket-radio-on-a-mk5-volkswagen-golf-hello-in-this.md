{% raw %}Hello, in this video I will be showcasing how to install an Aftermarket radio into your car. I've wanted to replace my old radio with a newer one for awhile now, so I thought to make a video on how to do it to help any of yous who wish to replace your own radio's to show how simple replacing it actually is. It may also help you save money so you don't have to get someone else to do it for you.<br /><br />Don't forget to Like, comment, subscribe ❤️<br /><br />Playlist Link:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjodWw51DPlLlgucTn3Rz2Ms0Fbjo05VQ">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLjodWw51DPlLlgucTn3Rz2Ms0Fbjo05VQ</a><br />Previous Video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/bvyimrA56d4">https://youtu.be/bvyimrA56d4</a><br />More of the Mk5 Volkswagen Golf:<br /><br /><br />Song Used:<br />Track: Tom Wilson - Be Myself [NCS Release]<br />Music provided by NoCopyrightSounds.<br />Watch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/LG1iV_wzcTw">https://youtu.be/LG1iV_wzcTw</a><br />Free Download / Stream: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ncs.io/BeMyself">http://ncs.io/BeMyself</a>{% endraw %}
