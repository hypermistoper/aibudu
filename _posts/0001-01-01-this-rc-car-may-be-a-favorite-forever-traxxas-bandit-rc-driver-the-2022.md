{% raw %}The 2022 Traxxas Bandit XL5 RC Buggy found here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://snp.link/e95d46e6">https://snp.link/e95d46e6</a> is basically the same Bandit we’ve seen, well forever, but with some tweaks for a refresh. The Traxxas Bandit has always been a solid platform and has introduced a ton of people to hobby grade RC’s. This year it did receive a few tweaks to give it a fresh more modern look. The biggest new feature are the included LED lights along with a big front bumper. This fun stylish addition along with new body graphics and new wheels have really given this tried and true platform a great look for new RC drivers coming into the hobby. In this video, Greg will go over the buggy and take it out for some fun bashing.
