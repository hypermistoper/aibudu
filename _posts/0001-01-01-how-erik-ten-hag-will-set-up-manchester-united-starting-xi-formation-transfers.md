{% raw %}Welcome back! After months of speculation, Manchester United have finally appointed Erik ten Hag as their next permanent manager. Touted as one of the hottest managerial prospects around Europe, Ten Hag has his work cut out, with a major rebuild needed at Old Trafford. But if given backing and the time required to implement his philosophy, the Dutchman will be a success.<br /><br />Statman Dave Clips ‚û° <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/StatmanClips">http://bit.ly/StatmanClips</a><br /><br />Erik ten Hag‚Äôs go to formation is a 4-2-3-1 but with a highly fluid and mobile system this starting shape is largely irrelevant with players freely interchanging positions when in possession.<br />Taking his most recent Ajax side as an example when they have the ball we often see: Really high and wide wingers who stretch the pitch, a central midfielder joining the number 10 on the attacking midfield line whilst the other is joined by the right back as the left back usually creates a back 3 with the centre backs. Whilst Ten Hag‚Äôs starting formation could be a 4-2-1-3, a 4-3-3 or something else entirely, it isn't that important. What is important however is the roles and instructions he gives to his players.<br /><br />‚ñ∫ SUBSCRIBE to STATMAN DAVE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/StatmanDaveYoutube">http://bit.ly/StatmanDaveYoutube</a><br /><br />For Manchester United it‚Äôs logical to assume that Erik Ten Hag will implement a similar system that effectively got him the job in the first place. Using the current squad of players available I‚Äôd expect David de Gea to continue in goal with a back four of Diogo Dalot, Harry Maguire, Raphael Varane and Luke Shaw. In midfield, United are without a player capable of playing the anchor man role, meanwhile, the offensive box to box role could suit Fred who would join Bruno Fernandes in attacking midfield. And finally I‚Äôd expect a front 3 from left to right of Jadon Sancho, Cristiano Ronaldo and Jadon Sancho. <br /><br />At Ajax, Ten Hag made use of ‚ÄúPremier League failures‚Äù turning them from unwanted players for the likes of Everton, Southampton and West Ham to topping metrics in the Champions League. His coaching and tactical system will breathe new life into all the players that train under him at Manchester United but despite that I still think there are several areas that can be massively improved.<br /><br />In goal, as great as David De Gea has been, Ten Hag wants a ball playing goalkeeper and that‚Äôs just not where the Spaniard excels. Ten Hag will also want a quick, ball playing centre back. Bringing Timber with him from Ajax could be great business. A defensive midfielder is a must. An area that‚Äôs been a problem since Michael Carrick retired, whilst United could save money on the likes of Kalvin Phillips and Tchouameni, I think spending the money on Rice is the move that provides a guarantee that the position is fixed. In attack I think an inverted right winger could be signed to add quality and variety to the forward options. Still not safe from relegation, Raphinha could be available at a cut price if Leeds get relegated. And finally up front. Cristiano Ronaldo is 37 and even if he‚Äôs still at the club beyond the summer United need an alternative. Gianluca Scamacca could be perfect. He‚Äôs been touted as ‚ÄúThe Next Zlatan‚Äù as despite being 6 foot 5, like Ibrahimovic, Scamacca also combines his physical size with incredible agility and technical ability. <br /><br />‚ñ∫ CHECK US OUT ON TWITCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SMDTwitch">http://bit.ly/SMDTwitch</a><br /><br />It‚Äôs important to remember that Ten Hag has had a lot of success by integrating Ajax academy graduates into his first team and with an excellent youth setup at Old Trafford we could see new starters emerge. Amad Diallo, Alejandro Garnacho, Charlie McNeil, Kobbie Mainoo, Teden Mengi and Jimmy Garner could all get a chance to impress.<br /><br />Whilst there‚Äôs a lot of work to be done at Old Trafford, with Erik Ten Hag at the helm and backed by the club I‚Äôm extremely hopeful as a Manchester United fan.<br /><br />But what do you think?
