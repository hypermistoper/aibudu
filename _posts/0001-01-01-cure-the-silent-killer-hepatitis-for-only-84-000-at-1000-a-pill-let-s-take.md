Hepatitis is inflammation of the liver. There are different kinds of hepatitis, but we’re going to discuss viral hepatitis. <br /><br />There aren’t many signs or symptoms of hepatitis, which is why they call it a silent killer. Hepatitis causes a lot of destruction while also paralyzing the immune system, so it can’t fight back. Over time the viral destruction turns into inflammation, which can lead to fibrosis. <br /><br />There is a treatment plan that uses a medication called Sovaldi as well as other medications to treat hepatitis C. This hepatitis treatment plan has a high success rate of 80-86%. One of the problems with this hepatitis cure is that it’s very expensive. <br /><br />Patents using herbal remedies for hepatitis:<br />Patent #1 — <br />Cure rate: <br /> • 95% for hepatitis A <br /> • 90% for hepatitis B<br /><br />Natural remedies involved:<br /> • Wormwood extract<br /> • Coix root <br /> • Red sage root<br /><br />Patent #2 —<br />Natural remedies involved:<br /> • Nutgrass <br /> • Nagarmotha oil <br /><br />Patent #3 —<br />Natural remedies involved:<br /> • Milk thistle <br /> • Artichoke <br /> • Licorice <br /> • Turmeric <br /> • Ginseng <br /> • Stinging nettle <br /> • Ginger <br /><br />It’s also important to keep in mind that a vitamin D deficiency is associated with increased susceptibility to hepatitis B and C viruses. This means vitamin D may help protect you from hepatitis B and C and help minimize the damage if you have hepatitis B or C. Vitamin D also decreases the replication of viruses. <br /><br />Another remedy I would take if I had hepatitis is NAC. NAC can help with oxidation, inflammation, and damage that occurs when you have hepatitis <br /><br />Follow Me On Social Media:<br />Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/FB-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/FB-DrBerg</a><br />Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/IG-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/IG-DrBerg</a><br />Anchor:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Anchor-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/Anchor-DrBerg</a><br />TikTok:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/TikTok-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/TikTok-DrBerg</a><br /><br />ADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description">https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description</a><br /><br />FREE COURSE➜ ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse">http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse</a><br /><br />Talk to a Dr. Berg Keto Consultant today and get the help you need on your journey.
