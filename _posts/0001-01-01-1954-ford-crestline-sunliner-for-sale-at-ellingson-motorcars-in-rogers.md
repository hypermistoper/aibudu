{% raw %}This 1954 Ford Crestline Sunliner Convertible is a beautifully restored, mid-fifties cruiser that anybody can enjoy! 1954 marked a major shift for the Ford Motor Company. For the first time in the company's history, it moved away from the L-Head V8 design that drove the company's success for the past 20+ years. In 1954, Ford introduced its brand-new overhead valve V8 design (one year ahead of rival Chevrolet) and that leap forward in engine design would propel the FoMoCo to even greater heights. The new OHV V8 produced more horsepower than the now outdated Ford Flatty and the new overhead valve V8 was well-received by and quite popular amongst consumers. Of the 3 trim levels for Ford in 1954, the Crestline was the top of the line model with upgraded exterior trim and the plushest interiors. This particular Crestline Sunliner comes to us from the warm climates of the south where it spent the nearly last 15 years. Under the hood is an upgraded 292 V8 paired with a single 2 barrel carburetor. The NOM 292 V8 is mated to an Automatic Transmission ensuring that just about anybody can take this classic Ford for a spin. This '54 Ford is also outfitted with power steering which makes getting in and out of those tight parking spaces much easier and improves the overall drivability of the car. Additionally, the original 6 volt electrical system was upgraded under previous ownership to a more modern and more reliable 12 Volt electrical system for improved startup and electrical output. The exterior on this 1954 Crestline has been refinished in beautiful Torch Red which truly stands out in a crowd. The white vinyl power convertible top is in wonderful condition and easily goes up and down with the simple push of a button. This 1954 Ford rides on 4 wide whitewall tires adorned with full wheel covers and the rear wheels are tucked behind a classy pair of fender skirts. A rear-mounted continental kit completes the classic fifties exterior look of this Ford. The interior on this Crestline Sunliner has a fantastic look. The front and rear bench seats are in superb shape having been reupholstered in red and white vinyl. The dash, door panels and steering wheel all appear to be in their stock configuration and are in wonderful condition. The dash is equipped with a 110 MPH speedometer, temperature gauge, and fuel gauge as well as a clock and upgraded entertainment system. Whether you're looking to buy your very first classic car or you're a 50s Ford fanatic, this 1954 Ford Crestline Sunliner Convertible would make an excellent choice.
