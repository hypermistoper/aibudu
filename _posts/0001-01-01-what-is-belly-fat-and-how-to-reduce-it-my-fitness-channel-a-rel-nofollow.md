Considering thin and normal people who have only a slight belly fat and wish to reduce only that belly, firstly let's get this cleared that &quot;There is no spot reduction&quot;; &quot;you just cannot target a particular point like a laser beam and try to burn that fat (spot reduction)&quot;. When fat loss occurs there would be decrease in fat proportionally all over the body. Considering people only with a big belly ( accumulation of fat only around the abdomen area), one of the causes could be increase in level of cortisol hormone, the other reasons would vary from individual to individual depending on lifestyle, habits, type of food and intake, medication etc. <br /><br />========================================­=====<br /><br />| Follow me |<br />► Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/csefracorrea/">https://www.facebook.com/csefracorrea/</a><br />► Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/sefra.correa/">https://www.instagram.com/sefra.correa/</a><br />►Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/csefra">https://twitter.com/csefra</a><br /><br />#howto #reduce #bellyfat .{% endraw %}
