{% raw %}This is my favorite time of year, when all the new leaves on the trees come out at once.<br />I will build a cottage that is small, but with big windows, where I can relax and enjoy a cup of coffee. I intend to work a little bit at a time so as not to damage my body by overwork. Well, please take your time and watch.<br /><br />I'm not a &quot;YouTuber&quot;. If there was no YouTube in this world, I would be doing the same thing without anyone knowing about it. My videos are just a byproduct, not an end in themselves. Building a cabin or garden for YouTube content?  Isn’t that putting the cart before the horse?<br /><br />The products can be purchased.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/brcke">https://teespring.com/stores/brcke</a>{% endraw %}
