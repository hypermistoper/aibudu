A self-confessed â€˜Afro-headâ€™, Nigerian superstars such as Wande Coal and Wizkid left a lasting impact on Darkoo, particularly after she moved to London around the age of seven. <br /><br />In 2019 Darkoo released her stand-out track, 'Gangsta' featuring fellow Londoner and rapper One Acen. Featuring her signature deep husky vocals, the track shot the teenager to fame, quickly becoming a TikTok favourite and was crowned the biggest Afrobeat Song of 2020 and earning her three MOBO nominations.<br /><br />At just 19, the possibilities for Darkoo seem endless and though the pandemic has no doubt delayed her plans for a headline show her career is already in full motion while fans eagerly await her first EP that sheâ€™s currently working on. <br /><br />#Darkoo #Always #BlackSherif #IfRosesAreRedAndVioletsAreBlue{% endraw %}
