{% raw %}Hi, here we have 3 broken Super Nintendo Entertainment Systems purchased from eBay for Â£50. They have a mixture of faults such as no power, black screen of death and one plays the game but doesn't show the display properly.  <br />How many can be fixed, none? 1,2 or 3....let's find out.<br /><br />Merch is here!!!!! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.puddlt.com/my-mate-vince">https://www.puddlt.com/my-mate-vince</a><br /><br />If you would like to support these videos, please click here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/mymatevince">https://www.patreon.com/mymatevince</a><br /><br />If you have an interesting 'non returnable' item for a 'trying to fix' video then my PO box is as follows. Please only use if you are from the UK and using Royal Mail.<br /><br />PO Box 2597<br />WATFORD<br />WD18 1HT<br />UK<br /> <br />Remember that this is just for entertainment and I am not an expert in these repairs. The processes in the video may not be the best way, the correct way or the safest way to fix these things. I do love fault finding and trying to fix broken things, so I hope that comes across in this 'Trying to FIX' series. Many thanks, Vince.{% endraw %}
