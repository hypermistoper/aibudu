{% raw %}IMPORTANT: This video is just a guide, I don't know if everybody has the same thoughts as me so please do your own research. I prefer the asian side because it's less touristy. However there is nothing there for tourists, it depends if you want to see sights or just take in Istanbul like a local. <br /><br />In this video i will describe the areas around central Istanbul and give you tips on where to stay. I suggest not staying in Sultan Ahmet like most tourists. The area is beautiful but the food is bad and expensive and everything has tourist prices. Staying there for a few days is fine, but not more than that.<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/istanbulhacks/">https://www.instagram.com/istanbulhacks/</a><br />Twittter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/istanbulhacks">https://www.twitter.com/istanbulhacks</a>{% endraw %}
