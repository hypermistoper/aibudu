{% raw %}This meditation, approximately eight minutes in length, will offer you the opportunity to pause and replenish, so that you can show up as your best self.  Through mindful breathing and guided meditation, you will have the chance to nourish yourself, come into the present moment, and go forward into your day with a greater sense of ease.  It can be helpful to do at any time, but may be especially helpful when you are experiencing stress.<br /><br />Videos and Images courtesy of pixabay.com<br /><br />This video is one in a series.  For more meditation videos and other resources, go to BethKurland.com.  These short video meditations can be used throughout your day whenever you would like to: practice mindfulness by bringing your awareness into the present moment; practice taking a few moments to pause, interrupt the stress response and &quot;reset&quot; your nervous system; and practice turning on your relaxation response to help promote greater ease and calmness (see individual descriptions).  They may be used individually based on your needs, or collectively at different points throughout your day and week to provide a set of skills to help you navigate day-to-day stress and cultivate greater resiliency and well-being.<br /><br />Disclaimer:  This meditation is purely for educational purposes, and is not intended as a psychological intervention or as a substitute for professional mental health or other services.{% endraw %}
