{% raw %}Very nice piano collection to listen to and study at the same time, Meditation, Spa<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rOuaQfmBd6A">https://youtu.be/rOuaQfmBd6A</a><br />===========================<br />Producer: Chan Peaceful Piano<br />ðŸ“œ Message from the composer and creator of Chan Peaceful Piano<br />&quot;This is a collection of piano music that I enjoy listening to when I need to study or just want to relax.<br />It is hard for me to focus when I study in my room, so I like to put on some music in the background. This way, it's easier for me to get into the right mindset and get work done faster.<br />The songs are all instrumental and are usually calming. They are perfect for studying because they help me stay focused on what I'm doing instead of getting distracted by other things around me.<br />I also like listening to these songs while reading because they help me stay calm and not get too excited about what might happen next in the story.<br />I hope you enjoy this playlist!&quot;<br />Relevant hashtags:<br />#relaxingmusic, #sleepmusic, #soothingrelaxation<br />Copyright Â© 2021 Chan Peaceful Piano, All rights reserved<br />=================<br />Chan Peaceful Piano{% endraw %}
