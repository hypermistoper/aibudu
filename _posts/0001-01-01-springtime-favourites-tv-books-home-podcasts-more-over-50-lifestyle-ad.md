This doesn't affect my opinions. <br /><br />ad-PR Gifts that are mentioned within the video are marked with **<br />ad-PR Discounted items are marked with ***<br /><br />Often items are sent to me for free and the brands that send these know that I cannot guarantee them specific coverage. If I don't like an item I have been sent for free I just won't mention it, so please know you can still trust my opinion even on gifted items. <br /><br />Any paid for advertisements I do, I will include AD in the video title and you will see 'paid promotion' written on the screen during the first 20 seconds of the video.. An AD means I have been paid by a brand to talk specifically about a product or service. I only work with brands I genuinely like and would recommend.{% endraw %}
