{% raw %}Is Alie using Melvin for clout and views? Melvin and Regina are on a mission to find the Cloaker who recently threatened Melvins life! But he's more interested in finding out wether or not Alie is using him for fame when she spots her vlogging at the park. On top of that he spots a mysterious man interact with Alie and sees that he leaves a Hershey's chocolate kiss by a tree that Alie seemed interested in. Are they working together, does she have a secret crush? Melvin decides to spy on the mysterious man to find out. He's also upset that he's the one who helped her build an online presence by convincing her to do a face reveal, he wants to spy on her and top whatever she does! When she does a chip challenge, Melvin goes even further to do the same thing but with apples. When he sees her using the new SpyNinja drone, he tries to show case his skills by playing chicken with it. Regina thinks they should be focusing on the cloaker instead but Melvin has other interests. Will Regina be able to save her brother from the Cloaker?
