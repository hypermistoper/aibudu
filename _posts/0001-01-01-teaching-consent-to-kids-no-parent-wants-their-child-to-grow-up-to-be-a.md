{% raw %}No parent wants their child to grow up to be a victim or a perpetrator, which means teaching about consent early is crucial. <br /><br />Subscribe to our YouTube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2BWqIRj">http://bit.ly/2BWqIRj</a><br /><br />Lauren Vinopal, Fatherly’s Science Reporter, shows us that teaching consent to your kid is actually pretty simple.<br /><br />Though some parents may dismiss early discussions about bodies and sex as reactionary or inappropriate, the truth is consent is not just about sex. It’s about boundaries. Something that’s crucial for every child to learn.<br />Nurturing this understanding of boundaries in your child at a young age will help to develop their empathy and self-worth. However, as they grow older, many adults often only mention STDs and pregnancy when discussing sex with children. Therefore it’s important to explicitly connect consent with sex, empowering them to form healthy adult relationships.<br /><br /><br /><br />Fatherly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fatherly.com/">https://www.fatherly.com/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FatherlyHQ/">https://www.facebook.com/FatherlyHQ/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/fatherly/">https://www.instagram.com/fatherly/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FatherlyHQ">https://twitter.com/FatherlyHQ</a>{% endraw %}
