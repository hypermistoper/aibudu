{% raw %}If you think they are manipulators, and show a pattern of giving people the cold shoulder, ignore them. Give them a big fake smile and act like they are not even bothering you. But don't make them the center of attention. That is what they want. Instead, smile and be polite, but avoid them! Now, if this is a person you really care about and doesn't normally act cold or distant, then you need to find out what is wrong and rectify the situation. Usually it is simply a communication problem.<br /><br />Marie Dubuque is a life coach who loves to give advice on everything from dating dilemmas and tricky social situations to drama-filled friendships and romantic relationships gone south!{% endraw %}
