{% raw %}Back on Easter Monday, our friends at Folk on Foot put together an online Front Room Festival for everyone to enjoy, with musicians performing sets from their front rooms. They have successfully fundraised to not only pay the artists, but also donate to Help Musicians UK, a charity supporting musicians in financial hardship (please do donate if you can). Among the starry line-up of folk legends was Karine Polwart, and here is her wonderful set for you to enjoy.<br /><br />Karine will perform at Kings Place in November as part of Common Ground, a day-long festival of inspiring events exploring the role folk music can play in highlighting environmental issues. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on/folk/karine-polwart/">https://www.kingsplace.co.uk/whats-on/folk/karine-polwart/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.folkonfoot.com/">https://www.folkonfoot.com/</a>{% endraw %}
