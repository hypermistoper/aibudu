{% raw %}This episode is about the thrill of calling in Herd Bulls away from their cows and what it takes to do that. <br /><br />The episode is not about good shooting, poor shooting or ethics- it’s about calling big bulls in and how to go about it. <br />Please take that into consideration before making a critical, armchair ethics comment. <br /><br />Part 2 coming soon… Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
