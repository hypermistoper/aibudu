She has been a primary collaborator of choreographer William Forsythe in the Ballet Frankfurt and the Forsythe Company for the last 27 years. Since completing a masterâ€™s degree in Conflict Studies and Mediation, Dana has worked as a conflict mediator and coach, and has developed and offered conflict workshops and choreographic public dialogue projects internationally. Dana is the author of the new book CHANGING THE CONVERSATION: The 17 Principles of Conflict Resolution, published by Penguin Books in January 2015. @danacaspersen<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
