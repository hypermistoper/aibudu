So we're getting back into these with Mondstadt's alcohol-hating bartender at Cat's Tail: the Cryo archer Diona!<br /><br />We have a new face joining us for this one, with Dina Sherman, Diona's English voice actress, chatting with us about Genshin, life, and a special charity event happening soon with Game For Change.<br /><br />Please note: if you use any portion of this stream or of any videos on this channel, credit back to the original video with a link.

Do not spam.<br />2. NSFW topics, hate speech, and bullying are not permitted. <br />3. Do not ask personal questions (about Zach’s family, health, location, etc.), do not make assumptions about personal details, and do not share personal information.<br />4. Do not make Zach feel uncomfortable with topics such as: asking him out, pressuring him to say lines, being rude to him about his roles, etc. Please also refrain from asking Zach to say things you want him to say! (Topics such as &quot;happy birthday&quot; or just saying hello are okay). <br />5. Do not privately contact Zach on his social media or email, if not a business inquiry.<br />6. Do not repeatedly talk about content creators or voice actors that are not currently guesting on the stream.<br />7. Keep chat conversations to stream topics - topics such as shipping, unrelated conversations, etc. are not allowed. <br />8. Do not talk about content from games Zach voices in that is not officially confirmed.<br />9. Please try to keep the chat in English, as Zach and the moderators cannot understand you otherwise. Moderators need to understand the chat to do their jobs!<br />10. Any stream-specific rules will be pinned or otherwise mentioned by mods.<br /><br />People in chat that do not follow these rules may have their comments removed and will be timed out or hidden from the channel. Note that in some cases, Zach may not be able to read Super Chats out loud in the interest of time - your support is always appreciated! <br /><br />#GenshinImpact #Diona #Aether{% endraw %}
