{% raw %}Is Samsung Tab S8 Ultra better than iPad Pro in terms of the software? We'll take a look at the software experience of these two tablets. We'll explore One UI 4 (including Samsung Dex) and iPadOS 15, and at the end of the video, I'll tell you which one I think is the better operating system. I've been wanting to make more software comparison videos, so I hope you enjoyed watching this one and found it helpful :)<br /><br />❀ timestamps ❀<br />0:00 - Intro <br />0:49 - Looks<br />1:45 - Multitasking <br />4:53 - Samsung Dex<br />6:39 - Apps<br />7:32 - Apple Pencil/S Pen &amp; Notetaking<br />9:39 - Which one's better?<br /><br />❀ my socials ❀<br />📸 Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/createdbyella">https://www.instagram.com/createdbyella</a><br />🎶 TikTok - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@createdbyellayt">https://www.tiktok.com/@createdbyellayt</a><br />🐦 Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CreatedbyElla">https://twitter.com/CreatedbyElla</a><br />🎥 Vlog Channel - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/VlogsByElla">https://www.youtube.com/VlogsByElla</a><br />🛒 Amazon Page - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/createdbyella">https://www.amazon.com/shop/createdbyella</a><br />📧 For business inquiries, contact: createdbyellayt@gmail.com<br /><br />❀ my setup + filming equipment (affiliate links) ❀<br />My tech setup + favorites: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://a.co/iNv3K0G">https://a.co/iNv3K0G</a><br />My current filming equipment: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://a.co/gv4TVuV">https://a.co/gv4TVuV</a><br /><br />❀ about me ❀<br />My name's Ella and I'm currently a university student studying computer science.
