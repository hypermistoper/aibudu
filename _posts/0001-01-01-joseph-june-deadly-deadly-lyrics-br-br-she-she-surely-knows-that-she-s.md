{% raw %}DEADLY lyrics:<br /><br />She, she surely knows that she's deadly<br />See, I really can't see why we revving<br />Seat, she's in a front seat with her window opened<br />Passing eyes, passing faces, making all them petty<br /><br />Breath, I really can't breath<br />She, she turns to me<br />Looking confident as hell<br />With all secrets, she won't tell <br /><br />Deadly, ready<br />Ready to show me her power<br />Deadly, ready ready<br />Ready to set me on fire<br /><br />Show me, show me her power<br />Set me, set me on fire (2x)<br /><br />I know, I know, she knows<br />That she is controlling where the wind will blow<br />That she is so complex like a code<br />I will never read, she will never show<br /><br />Somehow I'm blind and deaf<br />To her toxic patterns and the signs, she left<br />To her intentions to her theft<br />Being more dangerous than the rest<br /><br />Stop, please listen<br />The mist doesn't let you see that you're addicted<br />She's like nicotine like the fifth gear shifted<br />She's like a fake story that has all been scripted<br /><br />She uses you like her RAM<br />Like getting a free phone it's a scam<br />You never know the path you're in<br />But you're still chasing you are still her fan<br /><br />She, she surely knows that she's deadly<br />See, I really can't see why we revving<br />Seat, she's in a front seat with her window opened<br />Passing eyes, passing faces, making all them petty<br /><br />Breath, I really can't breath<br />She, she turns to me<br />Looking confident as hell<br />With all secrets, she won't tell <br /><br />Deadly, ready<br />Ready to show me her power<br />Deadly, ready ready<br />Ready to set me on fire<br /><br />Show me, show me her power<br />Set me, set me on fire (2x)<br /><br /><br />Follow Joseph June:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/joseph_june_/">https://www.instagram.com/joseph_june_/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/JosephJune06">https://www.facebook.com/JosephJune06</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zDk3YjETE4jO2r6Q6DbaG?si=s4lhsd9oQ0m6kGkBwiQsvw">https://open.spotify.com/artist/2zDk3YjETE4jO2r6Q6DbaG?si=s4lhsd9oQ0m6kGkBwiQsvw</a>{% endraw %}
