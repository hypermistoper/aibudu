{% raw %}______________John Cage 100 (1912-2012)__________<br /><br />John Cage (1912-1992): Sixty-Eight, for orchestra (1992).<br /><br />Radio Sinfonie Orchester Frankfurt diretta da Lucas Vis.<br /><br />The composition consists of 15 single notes (C#, G#, A, C, Bb, G, B, E, A, B, D#, G, G#, F and D) played throughout the orchestra. Because of its &quot;time-brackets&quot; structure the start and ending of each note may be different for each player, creating a inexact sense of unison, with overtones effecting the color of the sound.<br />(Fonte: Web).<br /><br />***<br /><br />The music published in our channel is exclusively dedicated to divulgation purposes and not commercial.
