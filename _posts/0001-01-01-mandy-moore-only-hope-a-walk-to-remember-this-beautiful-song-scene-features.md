{% raw %}This beautiful song/scene features the WONDERFUL singer/actress Mandy Moore, (This Is Us) and Shane West, whose character was court ordered to join this H.S. play to get some responsibility in his life. During this scene from A Walk To Remember, he fell completely in love with her. Wouldn't you? This film REALLY put Mandy on the map. It has a plot twist in it written by the Devils in Hell.{% endraw %}
