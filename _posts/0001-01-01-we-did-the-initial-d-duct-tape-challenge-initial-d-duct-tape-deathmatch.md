{% raw %}Initial D duct tape deathmatch between me and another Youtuber @Rizon in Forza Horizon 5. We taped our hands on the steering wheel and competed against each other in a mountain section. I was using the AE86 from Initial D and he was using the RX-7. We're both using T300 steering wheel setups for drifting in this gameplay. If you have other drift challenge ideas, let me know!<br /><br />Outro song: Gill Bates - _91nova<br /><br />--- Join our Discord here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/R6y34My">https://discord.gg/R6y34My</a><br /><br />--- My Twitch link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/goosiesttv">https://www.twitch.tv/goosiesttv</a><br /><br />--- My PC stats: <br />Graphics card: GeForce RTX 3070<br />Processor: Ryzen 9 (4,8GHz)<br />RAM: 16GB<br />Disc Space: 1K SSD{% endraw %}
