Gutted out, replaying every line you said, <br />And thinking why can’t I just forget it and why can’t I live without you.  I wish I held my ground or I could just go back <br />And disappear from you.  <br />I let you in you stole a piece of me <br />And now I can’t take it back from you again.  <br />You carved my body from the inside out.  <br />Never hesitated.  <br />Left me on the boulevard here to bleed.  <br />Your eyes had pureness cutting through.  <br />You had me breaking my own rules, assuring me it’s okay, <br />This is different, you know we’re different. <br />I’m such a mess I’ve tried and tried to unlearn your spell, <br />Uncross the line maintain my confidence outside <br />But this pain it won’t escape me.  <br />A city drenching me in sin.  <br />Below these buildings I’m still sinking <br />As I swim in my continual condition.  <br />I’m off the beaten path, smashing every light I pass. <br />I’m so far away, and the darkness makes me need you.{% endraw %}
