{% raw %}Join us this week on Aboard Mermaid Monster as we cruise through some TERRIBLE CHOPPY BIG WAVES! These waves were wind blown, spaced right on top of one another and just down right nasty. But we decide to make lemonade out of lemons and had a blast playing on the bow in them… especially Braden. He loved testing out his new Helly Hansen waterproof foul weather gear jacket. This is the beautiful thing about adventurous travel and living.. it never gets old and there his never a dull moment aboard our boat. In this episode we are cruising from Atlantic City NJ and beyond. With a destination that’s unknown watch to see where we end up for the night! It might surprise you. Please enjoy this show!
