{% raw %}Customers got to experience the latest build of Tesla's FSD software today and the reactions were priceless!<br /><br />Welcome to CYBRLFT where I challenge the Beta daily and get reactions and feedback from real world customers!<br /><br />**Important Safety Note**<br />Safety is my number 1 priority and concern while operating Tesla's FSD Beta software and at no point have I, nor will I subject customers to unnecessary risk. I am in full control, take over regularly, and I am extremely vigilant and cautious at all times. Furthermore, I do not subject anyone to Self Driving features that are uncomfortable or request me not to use it. #Tesla #FSDBeta #RoboTaxi{% endraw %}
