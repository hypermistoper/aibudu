{% raw %}I really like the analogy of antibiotics as the fire extinguishers of medicine because it's such a clear concept. It's a tool that you use in an emergency and a question that we discuss in a number of videos and newsletters is what's the value of a fire extinguisher? Well, we have a current example that I think is just really, really instructive and that's the case of the coronavirus/the COVID 19 epidemic And let's approach the value of fire extinguishers by doing a thought experiment.<br /><br />We're going to hop in a time machine, we're going to go back 10 years, and we're going to start a company and that company is going to recognize that the viruses SARS and MERS, which were known ten years ago belong to a family of viruses called the Coronaviridae and we're going to settle down and we're going to invent a pill that treats SARS and MERS and we'll do, we use the available tools, there aren't a lot of infections going on right now but maybe we'll do some human challenge studies and we will get approved, we'll get a magic coronavirus pill approved in 2018. It'll be available in 2018. <br /><br />So let's think about what happens in 2018. How many cases of SARS and MERS were there in 2018?<br />Zero nearly.<br /><br />How many cases of coronavirus were there in 2018? <br />Well, we didn't know about it then.<br /><br />How much would we have sold? None.<br /><br />Could we have stayed in business?<br />There's no way! Obviously there's no income.<br /><br />But that's only if you think of this coronavirus pill as being just for SARS and MERS, little did we know that at the end of 2019 suddenly we have a new coronavirus!<br /><br />And when it turns out that our pill works for that one as well, which I‚Äôm hoping that it does, that's the point of this thought experiment. The outbreak in Wuhan would have gone quite differently because we would have all recognized &quot;Oh, it's coronavirus, SARS, MERS, does this pill work? Yes, it does. Let's get going, let's treat people with this therapy.&quot;<br /><br />So here we would have been using a therapy for COVID virus as a fire extinguisher that's going to put out the fire of the COVID infection and it's not going to spread or when it does spread we can tamp it out, you know, you do what you do with fires, you keep chasing them until you put them all out. And if you think about then the value of the pill in that context let's just sort of run to ground here. How much anti-COVID virus pill would we have sold in 2020? Well, some. Because we would need some and Wuhan we might need some around the world.<br /><br />Would we have needed, you know, billions of dollars‚Äô worth of it? Actually, probably, hopefully not! Actually because there wouldn't have been that many cases where we would have used it to treat a human being.<br /><br />Now the value of having it on hand is huge, right? A little outbreak begins, you can, you want to have enough to be able to quickly treat everybody who's gotten infected so it doesn't spread and we'd still need to work on developing vaccines but this idea that having it available keeps you from going into lockdown. Think of the value of that think. <br /><br />Think of the difference between what would have happened had we had that, we wouldn't have this global lockdown stuff going on, we would actually be, we'd be being careful, there'd be a lot of other stuff going on, but the ability to treat would have made us all safe and that's the point of a fire extinguisher. Fire extinguisher makes you safe to be in a building. Come to antibiotics/antibacterial antibiotics, they make it safe for you to get your hip replaced, have your heart surgery, <br />the whole point is that by having a fire extinguisher on hand, you put the fire out before it spreads! And life goes on. <br /><br />Finished the video?
