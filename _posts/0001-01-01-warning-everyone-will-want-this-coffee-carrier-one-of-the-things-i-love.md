{% raw %}One of the things I love about woodworking is when I have a need for something, I can make it myself, like this handy Coffee Carrier/Drink Carrier that can carry 2 hot drinks, AND even a small bag with snacks for those days we want to treat ourselves. This was a perfect woodworking project for some of that spalted wood I found in the forest and was able to cut some small logs, into spalted boards and by using my drill press with a holes saw, my wood router to make a shallow pocket, and then my trim router to round over the edges I made several of these, and every time I head out for coffees I take this coffee cup carrier and WOW, does it get noticed by everyone at the coffee shop, so beware, if you make one, you may end up with others wanting one too. It even works great as a car cup holder and is one of those woodworking projects you can sell! <br /><br />********** Spalted Wood Videos **********<br />Exotic Spalted Wood with a Bandsaw Sled: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/x8QYUOQG-H0">https://youtu.be/x8QYUOQG-H0</a><br />Making Spalted Wood in The Workshop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/WvCwX6DRyUk">https://youtu.be/WvCwX6DRyUk</a><br />Finding Spalted Wood for Woodworking / Free Lumber: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/BkjjVNQL7u4">https://youtu.be/BkjjVNQL7u4</a><br />************************<br />#CoffeeCarrier #DrinkHolder #WoodworkingProject<br /><br />Read Full Article on the Coffee Carrier Woodworking Project Here - Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/34rCDdF">https://bit.ly/34rCDdF</a><br /><br />*** Amazon Affiliate Store - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/woodworkweb">https://www.amazon.com/shop/woodworkweb</a> <br />*** Magswitch Affiliate Store - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mag-tools.com/discount/COLIN_KNECHT">https://mag-tools.com/discount/COLIN_KNECHT</a> <br />*** Canadian Amazon Affiliate Store - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/38h1uib">https://bit.ly/38h1uib</a><br />*** T-SHIRTS and Fun Stuff - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/woodworkweb-2">https://teespring.com/stores/woodworkweb-2</a> <br /><br />**** Subscribe here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/knecht105">https://www.youtube.com/user/knecht105</a> <br />** Like me at Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/DLgvoa">https://goo.gl/DLgvoa</a> <br />** Visit the website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.woodworkweb.com">http://www.woodworkweb.com</a> <br />** Follow on Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/colinknecht">https://www.instagram.com/colinknecht</a> <br />** Follow on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/woodworkweb">https://twitter.com/woodworkweb</a>{% endraw %}
