We believe the world has gotten too “busy” and that people are missing out on many of the true blessings this world has to offer. We started as a small urban homestead in Gilbert, AZ and after the city grew up around us, decided it was time leave corporate America and take a big leap of faith by moving our family to the Missouri Ozarks.  <br /><br />We put out 5 new videos every week!  Tuesday through Saturday.  We hope you will become part of our homestead family by subscribing to our channel and watching as we transition from city dwellers to full time homesteaders!{% endraw %}
