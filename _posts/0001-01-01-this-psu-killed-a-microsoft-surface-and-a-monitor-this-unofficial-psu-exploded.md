{% raw %}This unofficial PSU exploded and took out an expensive tablet and the monitor it was connected to.<br />It could have been worse.  The fault could have delivered a significant and sustained electric shock from any exposed metal on the tablet.<br /><br />If you have an identical style of power supply, then I recommend binning it and buying the real thing.  At the very least check for the same issue, although that will involve breaking it open.<br /><br />This unit has the model number DHM1800 and no serial number or traceability.  Other names and numbers may be used, so go by the shape and origin.<br /><br />Don't use cheap power supplies with expensive equipment.  At the very least it may impair it's operation.<br /><br />If you enjoy these videos you can help support the channel with a dollar for coffee, cookies and random gadgets for disassembly at:-<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.bigclive.com/coffee.htm">http://www.bigclive.com/coffee.htm</a><br />This also keeps the channel independent of YouTube's advertising algorithms allowing it to be a bit more dangerous and naughty.<br /><br /><br /><br />#ElectronicsCreators{% endraw %}
