{% raw %}Take this cool kids project challenge. Our goal with this challenge is to make a crane that can hold the weight of at least 12 pennies. To do this, you will have to BE COURAGEOUS by subjecting your crane to the the full weight of the design, even if it means the crane might break and we end up having redesign. <br /><br />To get started you will need the following materials: <br />- cardboard (about 10x10”)  for base<br />- 5-10 sheets of copy paper<br />- masking tape<br />- scissors <br />- 2 paper or plastic cups<br />- 1 skinny dowel-like object (pencil, round chopstick, etc.)<br />- 5 paper clips<br />- at least 20” string<br /><br />When you have engineered your courageous crane that works share your creation with us on Facebook at: facebook.com/groups/CampGalileoAnywhere <br /><br />This project challenge — and others in the Camp Galileo Anywhere video series — teach kids to think like innovators.
