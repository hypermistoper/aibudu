{% raw %}#Belfast - #EverlastingLove - #LoveAffair - Soundtrack (FMV) - Square Version<br /><br />Note: The aspect ratio for this video has been changed to 4:3 <br /><br />Belfast is a semi-autobiographical from the director of this movie, Kenneth Branagh. It's a slice of life family drama mostly in Black and White while in some scenes they keep the color combined with the Black and White. There are not really much action in this movie so people should keep their expectations. All actors gave their best as always from Jamie Dornan, Caitriona Balfe, Jude Hill, Ciaran Hinds, and Judi Dench. Currently this movie is being nominated and winning numerous awards.<br /><br />The soundtrack of this movie use songs from Van Morrison since he is originally from Belfast. Only one song that is sung by Van Morrison that is specifically written for this movie: Down to Joy. But for this video I want to still use the song that appeared in the trailer and the important scene in the movie: Everlasting Love by Love Affair. I'm sure everyone must be familiar with this song since it's already been covered by so many artists.<br /><br />Thank you for watching.<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4ALP_NUUaGG_zcf2sat0TQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4ALP_NUUaGG_zcf2sat0TQ</a> <br />Buy me a coffee?: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ko-fi.com/movieatlas">https://www.ko-fi.com/movieatlas</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/movieatlasbali">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/movieatlasbali</a><br />PayPal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/movieatlas">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/movieatlas</a><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I DO NOT OWN THE RIGHTS OF THE MOVIE OR MUSIC.
