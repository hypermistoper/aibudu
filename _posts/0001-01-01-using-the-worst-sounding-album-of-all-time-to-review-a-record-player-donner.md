{% raw %}Donner sent me their new record player to review, and I put it to the test with the worst sounding album I could find! The Donner record player has a built-in speaker, aux output, and bluetooth capabilities, so you can listen to records with headphones, or play audio from your phone and computer. I've genuinely been using this a LOT since Donner sent it to me, and I've been really enjoying it<br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />00:00 - 01:18 - choosing a record<br />01:19 - 01:53 - WARNING: VERY LOUD SOUNDS<br />01:54 - 03:37 - don't listen with children, please<br />03:38 - 03:56 - listening to records with headphones!<br />03:57 - 05:22 - sending a Sakamoto album through Microcosm<br />05:23 - 06:12 - taking a phone call<br /><br />Use ‘EmilyH’ for up to 15% OFF on all Donner websites, and if you want to pick up your own record player, check out the link below!<br /><br />Donner DP-100 Turntable Style Bluetooth Speaker<br />⤑ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/3fmgx">https://shrsl.com/3fmgx</a><br /><br />US: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shrsl.com/3dx4y">https://shrsl.com/3dx4y</a><br />UK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/EH-idonner">https://bit.ly/EH-idonner</a><br />EU: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/EH-donnerfr">https://bit.ly/EH-donnerfr</a><br />AUSTRALIA: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/EH-donneraus">https://bit.ly/EH-donneraus</a><br /><br />Want to support the channel?
