They're not running from their feelings or emotions. In fact, they're not even running from challenges.<br /><br />So what are they running from?<br /><br />Sigma males are men who seek to improve themselves rather than sitting idly by and becoming a parasite in society. They strive for excellence, not mediocrity. They understand that they must make sacrifices in order to achieve greatness, because nothing great comes easy.<br /><br />Sigma males don't sit on the sidelines of life, they get involved. They strive for greatness, not some mediocre existence that's easy to live. They don't complain or make excuses for why they can't do something; they understand that there's no one to save them but themselves. They're more interested in being a ''somebody'' than a ''nobody''.<br /><br />They refuse to complain about what they don't have because they know that if they want something great, it must be earned. They refuse to let life happen to them, rather than making it happen.<br /><br />#sigmamale #sigma #wisethinker{% endraw %}
