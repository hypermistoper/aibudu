{% raw %}An original production only available only on YouTube.<br />Thanks for subscribing and sharing.<br /><br />Book Introduction:<br />The Kybalion is a study of the Hermetic Philosophy of Ancient Egypt and Greece. The Kybalion is attributed to the Hermes Trismegistus (a syncretic combination of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth). The Kybalion is a study of the Hermetic Philosophy of life and the 7 hermetic principles. It explores the relationships between human beings, the cosmos, and God. The book helped popularize the axiom As Above, So Below and propounds the idea that mind is causational. That within the limits of physical and material life we can create just as the higher mind can create. <br /><br />Chapters:<br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:58 - Introduction<br />09:12 - I.
