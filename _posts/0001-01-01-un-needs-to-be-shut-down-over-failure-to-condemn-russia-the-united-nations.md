{% raw %}The United Nations Security Council showed what a “pathetic, evil and redundant” assembly it is by its failure to condemn Russia’s actions in Ukraine, according to Sky News host Chris Smith. <br /><br />“It failed to take the most obvious action ... it needs to be shut down,” Mr Smith said. <br /><br />“This archaic process and veto power system in the UNSC, ensures that murderous actions by powerful states, which are violations of international law, go unpunished.<br /><br />“They can't even condemn a country like Russia, because Russia is a member, and can veto any kind of joint statement. It's as far away from democratic, as you could get.<br /><br />“What a moronic and evil institution the UN Security Council is, when all it does, is protect member nations, which decide for reasons of megalomania, to destroy another country and millions of its people.”{% endraw %}
