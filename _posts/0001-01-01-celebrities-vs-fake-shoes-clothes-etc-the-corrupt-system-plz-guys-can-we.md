While we still live in a society where it's looked down upon to wear counterfeit designer, shoes, clothing, etc... Some still see the light and chose the &quot;REAL&quot; alternative than wasting what used to be 10x their net worth on a bag that you will never see an ROI for. Among the list of rappers and celebs I speak about are NLE Choppa, Macklemore, Singles Inferno, and more...<br /><br />-All clips, music, and or pictures are under fair use, if you'd like yourself removed please DM me before we get into a copyright battle. Even the topic of replicas are under fair use, I speak from a third party perspective with knowledge of both sides on topics of which fall under fair use of my education and criticism. <br /><br />All my links! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/Ceedaz">https://linktr.ee/Ceedaz</a><br />Discord! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://Discord.gg/Cedaz">https://Discord.gg/Cedaz</a><br /><br />Join the discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/ygWrEKu">https://discord.gg/ygWrEKu</a> (discord boys get the vids early ;] )<br />Follow me on twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/xCedaz">https://twitter.com/xCedaz</a><br />The agent I use, Sugargoo: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sugargoo.com/index/user/register/invite/MTU3Mw%3D%3D.html">https://sugargoo.com/index/user/register/invite/MTU3Mw%3D%3D.html</a><br />Check out my insta! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/Cedaz">https://instagram.com/Cedaz</a>  (following people who sub back!!)<br />If you enjoyed at all drop me a sub :&quot;-(<br /><br />#Nike #Tiktok #UA #SNKRS{% endraw %}
