{% raw %}~*~ disclaimer: this is just from my perspective // i am not an all-knowing LA guru obviously ~*~ <br /><br />I made this video specifically because this was a really big point of contention in my life (wanting to pursue music in LA vs. being in a more sustainable personal environment) and I wish that I had been able to find a relatable viewpoint on this YEARS ago - so hopefully this can serve that purpose for someone else. This is in no way a slander video on LA, and if you watch the video at all you will find that this is actually somewhat of a love letter. Pls don't grill me I am just trying to help !!<br /><br />Also this video is not sponsored<br /><br />Also I know I say &quot;like&quot; a lot <br /><br />....Ok I think that covers it<br /><br /><br />Time Stamps!<br /><br />Intro/hi 0:06 - 0:56<br />pt 1 why I moved to LA 0:57 - 3:11<br />pt 2 pros of living in LA 3:11 - 6:17<br />pt 3 my career wouldn't be the same 6:17 - 08:22<br />pt 4: why career choice matters (kinda) 08:23 - 10:11<br />pt 5 why I left LA 10:12 - 13:38<br />pt 6 what am I doing now? 13:40 - 14:29<br />in conclusion 14:30 - 15:20 <br />Q&amp;A 15:21 - 19:11<br />Outro/bye 19:12 - 20:24<br /><br />Links to my music: <br />Bandcamp: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://badsnacks.bandcamp.com/">https://badsnacks.bandcamp.com/</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/5gZDpKtrxDf0ULvDuhLMZy">https://open.spotify.com/artist/5gZDpKtrxDf0ULvDuhLMZy</a><br />Apple Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bad-snacks/1294768469">https://music.apple.com/us/artist/bad-snacks/1294768469</a><br />Soundcloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/bad-snacks">https://soundcloud.com/bad-snacks</a><br /><br />As per usual, let's get social: <br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lilbadsnacks​​">https://www.instagram.com/lilbadsnacks​​</a> <br />TW: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitch.tv/lilbadsnacks​">https://twitch.tv/lilbadsnacks​</a> <br />FB: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/badsnacks/​​">https://www.facebook.com/badsnacks/​​</a> <br />E-mail: badsnacks@naymlis.com{% endraw %}
