{% raw %}Trauma is the leading cause of death in people aged 1 to 44 and the leading cause of life years lost. Athersys is collaborating with The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth) to conduct the first of its kind study of MultiStemÂ® Cell therapy to evaluate the safety and effectiveness in trauma patients. Listen as the clinical investigators describe the incidence of trauma, standard of care, the potential of MultiStem cell therapy, and the unique collaboration between UTHealth, Memorial Hermann Hospital, Athersys and MTEC, the funding arm of the Department of Defense.{% endraw %}
