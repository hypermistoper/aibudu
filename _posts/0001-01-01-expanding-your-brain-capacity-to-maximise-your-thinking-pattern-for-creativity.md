{% raw %}The reason why you are where you are stagnated, limited, unproductive and unable to move to your desired destination is because of your limited brain capacity that has also limited your thinking capacity. Remember you are what you think because as a man thinketh in his heart , so is he. Ideas and concepts rule the world but you lack ideas, innovation and productivity because of bankruptcy of quality thinking pattern  as a result of low brain capacity. God gave us brain so that he can rest from disturbance. Most of the prayers we pray disturbing God is not necessary only if we can sit down to think and reason it out, then we can be delivered. As you listen to this episode and apply your hearts and your heads to it fully, you will see your life moving towards your desired destination. it is a new day.{% endraw %}
