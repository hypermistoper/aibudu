The term describes vans that have been fitted out, whereas a motorhome is one with a coachbuilt body.<br /><br />Two Class C campervans, a Freightliner Sprinter (left) and Ford E-Series (right) chassis.<br />The term motorhome is sometimes used interchangeably with campervan, but the former can also be a larger vehicle than a campervan and intended to be more comfortable, whilst the latter is more concerned with ease of movement and lower cost.[1] For example, some campervans lack built-in toilets and showers, or a divide between the living compartment and the cab.[2]<br /><br />The United States term &quot;recreational vehicle&quot; (RV) is more analogous to motorhome than campervan.[citation needed]<br /><br />Volkswagen Autosleeper Clubman GL, a typical European campervan<br />Campervans may be equipped either with a &quot;pop-up&quot; roof which is raised during camping, or a fixed roof, either shared with the commercial van that forms the basis of the vehicle (commonly a &quot;high-top&quot; model), or as part of a custom coach-built body.<br /><br />Campervans usually have a small kitchen with a refrigerator (which is often powered by a choice of gas, battery, or mains electricity) and a two-burner gas hob and grill. They generally have dual-voltage lighting which can work from either a dedicated battery (other than the van battery) known as a deep-cycle or leisure battery, or from AC power, supplied at a campsite via a hook-up cable. Larger models may include a water heater, space heating and air conditioning, a portable toilet and an internal shower. Smaller models often carry a portable toilet, and sometimes an external shower that operates within the privacy of an awning.<br /><br />The term &quot;Dormobile&quot; is sometimes used generically in the United Kingdom due to a once highly popular conversion brand, and &quot;Kombi&quot; is used in Australia and other countries. The popularity of this type expanded in the 1950s after Volkswagen commissioned the Westfalia company to use the Kombi version of their Type 2 transporter as the basis for a campervan.<br /><br />Off-road variations<br />Off-road campervans are often referred to as 4WD or 4x4 campers. Some models include expandable tents mounted on the roof while others have pop-up roofs for additional sleeping space and storage.<br /><br />Pop-up roof variants share certain design elements with roof tents as sometimes fitted to more robust four wheel drive off-road vehicles intended for expeditions rather than relaxed camping. A compromise between these two purposes is sometimes reached by basing the conversion on an off-road vehicle. Sometimes the conversion is demountable from the back of a pick-up truck body.<br /><br />The car camper is an estate car(UK) or a station wagon (USA) converted into a travel home. The rear cargo area is converted into a full double bed area usually with a fabricated aluminium framework. All equipment necessary to set up a well-appointed camp site is stored under the double bed with access through lidded areas under the bed. Unlike a standard station wagon where the camping equipment has to be removed before sleeping or a tent set up, the car camper is self-contained{% endraw %}
