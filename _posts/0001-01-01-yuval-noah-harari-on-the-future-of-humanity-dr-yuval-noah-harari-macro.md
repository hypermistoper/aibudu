{% raw %}Dr. Yuval Noah Harari, macro-historian, Professor, best-selling author of &quot;Sapiens&quot; and &quot;Homo Deus,&quot; and one of the world's most innovative and exciting thinkers, has a few hypotheses of his own on the future of humanity. <br /><br />He examines what might happen to the world when old myths are coupled with new godlike technologies, such as artificial intelligence and genetic engineering.<br /><br />Harari tackles into todayâ€™s most urgent issues as we move into the uncharted territory of the future.<br /><br />According to Harari, we are probably one of the last generation of homo sapiens. Within a century earth will be dominated from entities that are not even human, intelligent species that are barely biological. Harari suggests the possibility that humans are algorithms, and as such Homo sapiens may not be dominant in a universe where big data becomes a paradigm.<br />Robots and AI will most likely replace us in our jobs once they become intelligent enough. <br /><br />Although he is hopeful that AI might help us solve many problems, such as healthcare, climate change, poverty, overpopulation etc, he cautions about the possibility of an AI arms race. <br /><br />Furthermore Dr. Yuval Noah Harari suggests this technology will also allow us to upgrade our brains and nervous systems. For example, humans will be able to connect their minds directly to the internet via brain implants.<br /><br />This is the shape of the new world, and the gap between those who get on-board and those left behind will be bigger than the gap between industrial empires and agrarian tribes, bigger even than the gap between Sapiens and Neanderthals.  This is the next stage of evolution.<br /><br />#harari_yuval #AI #science<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to our channel &quot;Science Time&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/sciencetime24">https://www.youtube.com/sciencetime24</a><br />SUPPORT us on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/sciencetime">https://www.patreon.com/sciencetime</a><br />BUY Science Time Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/science-time-merch">https://teespring.com/science-time-merch</a><br /><br />Sources:<br />Yuval Noah Harari - How to Survive the 21st Century | DAVOS 2020 The World Economic Forum <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/eOsKFOrW5h8">https://youtu.be/eOsKFOrW5h8</a><br /><br />The World Economic Forum<br />Will the Future Be Human? - Yuval Noah Harari <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/hL9uk4hKyg4">https://youtu.be/hL9uk4hKyg4</a><br /><br />Yuval Noah Harari - Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow{% endraw %}
