{% raw %}In this clip from episode 143 Fred talks about why he believes he should be in the Hall of Fame and why the criteria doesn't make much sense.<br /><br />Full episode here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/FHG3YldvqT0">https://youtu.be/FHG3YldvqT0</a><br />-----<br /><br />Get on the bus with NFL players Will Compton &amp; Taylor Lewan! The Boys are letting you in on their hilarious, high-energy (and often heartfelt) conversations. Topics range from exclusive stories to active player perspectives to out-of-left-field hot takes on things you and your friends only discuss behind closed doors. Sometimes they chat with a guest, sometimes it's just the two of them, but it's always a good time when you're Bussin' With The Boys.<br /><br />And yes, this is the podcast where Mike Vrabel said he'd cut his piece off for a Super Bowl.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />SHOP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://store.barstoolsports.com/collections/bussin-with-the-boys">https://store.barstoolsports.com/collections/bussin-with-the-boys</a><br /><br />FOLLOW THE BOYS<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bussinwtb/">https://www.instagram.com/bussinwtb/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BussinWTB">https://twitter.com/BussinWTB</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/BussinWTB/">https://www.facebook.com/BussinWTB/</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bussinwtb.com">https://www.bussinwtb.com</a><br /><br />LISTEN<br />iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BWTB_Apple">http://bit.ly/BWTB_Apple</a><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BWTB_Spotify">http://bit.ly/BWTB_Spotify</a><br /><br />-----<br /><br />SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS<br />Chevy<br /><br />-----<br /><br />#NFL #BarstoolSports #FredTaylor{% endraw %}
