{% raw %}You are all in for a special treat these next few weeks as we welcome my dear friend and guest of honor, Matty, onto the show! California native, Matty, a self-taught historian at the young age of 23 specializing in occultism and secret societies, joins us to present an enlightening series of episodes designed to lay the foundations of all the information so many of you have listened to since the birth of this podcast. Although we have sprinkled bits and pieces of history into this show, when I saw the depth of knowledge Matty has and the way he's able to present the facts in such a palatable way, I knew he needed to be a guest on the show. Matty's research is incredibly extensive, and he's been able to get his hands and eyes on extremely rare books, articles, and information that has all but been scrubbed off the internet and are almost impossible to find. The good news is Matty simplified the work for us so we don't have to go searching far and wide and he provides resources often during our conversation, so you don't have to spend all the time seeking the information as he did. <br /><br />In this Part 2, we are going to discuss sa-tanic cults, serial killers, and examples of the overlaps in recent history. Matty provides undeniable truth that sa-tanic cults exist and provides insight into how MSM distorts how this information is distributed... You don't want to miss this!<br /><br />I met Matty on Twitter where he compiled intricate threads of information on sat-anism, the occult, and Free-masonry that went viral and made their rounds getting shared by the Twitter community and eventually catching my eye. We've been playing around with the idea of podcasting for months now and I promise you it was well worth the wait and time taken to strategize this special series! You'd never know this is Matty's first ever podcast (what an honor!) as he speaks with elegance, clarity, and a depth of knowledge and understanding that goes well beyond his young age. It's incredibly inspiring to see younger and younger generations learning and researching these topics and - as you'll see - there is a bright place in Matty's future for being an authority on making these hard topics entertaining and easy to understand for people of all generations! <br /><br />In addition to being a brilliant speaker and independent researcher, Matty is also an athlete, an aspiring MLB Pitcher, bodybuilder, dog whisperer, and someone I cannot wait for you to connect with and get to know! I know you will enjoy this episode as much as I did! <br /><br />CONNECT WITH MATTY: <br />Twitter: @bigsurlifeguard - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BigSurLifeguard">https://twitter.com/BigSurLifeguard</a><br /><br />MATTY'S RECOMMENDED RESOURCES:<br />Matty's Twitter Thread on 'Sat-anic Cult Awareness': <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BigSurLifeguard/status/1463662680598884352">https://twitter.com/BigSurLifeguard/status/1463662680598884352</a><br />BOOKS: <br />-Maury Terry, &quot;The Ultimate Evil&quot;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://libgen.li/edition.php?id=136269455">https://libgen.li/edition.php?id=136269455</a><br />-David McGowan, &quot;Laurel Canyon&quot;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://libgen.li/edition.php?id=136971388">https://libgen.li/edition.php?id=136971388</a><br />-Office of Justice Programs, &quot;Satanic Cults&quot;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Photocopy/140554NCJRS.pdf">https://www.ojp.gov/pdffiles1/Photocopy/140554NCJRS.pdf</a><br />-Walter Bowart, &quot;Operation Mind Control&quot;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://libgen.li/edition.php?id=136213399">https://libgen.li/edition.php?id=136213399</a><br /><br />CONNECT WITH THE IMAGINATION: <br />Please connect with us on all other platforms: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://direct.me/theimaginationpodcast">https://direct.me/theimaginationpodcast</a>{% endraw %}
