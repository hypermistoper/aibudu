{% raw %}Once you check out these incredible benefits of eggs, you'll want to eat 4 eggs a day too! <br /><br />Eggs Increase Your Risk of Early Death from a Heart Attack:<br />▶️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/YkoPpvtSVyo">https://youtu.be/YkoPpvtSVyo</a><br />▶️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/RU8jn0kAmfk">https://youtu.be/RU8jn0kAmfk</a> <br /><br />0:00 Introduction: Why I eat 4 eggs daily<br />0:27 The nutrition in eggs <br />2:50 Free-range eggs vs. cage-free eggs vs. pasture-raised eggs<br />5:48 Egg benefits <br />10:45 How do you cook an egg to maximize nutrition? <br />11:34 Check out my video on the cholesterol in eggs! <br /><br />Today, I'm going to tell you why I eat four eggs a day and why you should do this too. <br /><br />The nutrition of an egg is determined by how the chicken is raised and by what it's fed. I recommend getting organic pasture-raised eggs. Getting your eggs from a farmer's market is a great idea or even raising your own chickens for eggs. <br /><br />It's important to note that I do not eat eggs for breakfast. I eat them for a late lunch because I fast breakfast. It's also important to consume the whole egg vs. only egg whites. <br /><br />Heating an egg can destroy some of the carotenoids. To maximize the nutrition of the eggs, it's great to have them poached or over-easy. If you like them scrambled, it's best to crack them inside of the pan and allow the whites to turn white before scrambling them.<br /><br />If you're a small person, you may want to consume one or two eggs a day. If you're a larger person, you may want to consume three or four. <br /><br />Health benefits of eggs:<br /> • Eggs are a great source of protein  <br /> • Eggs contain choline <br /> • Eggs contain lecithin <br /> • Eggs have vitamin K2, vitamin D, vitamin E, and vitamin A<br /> • Eggs are rich in omega-3 fatty acids<br /> • Eggs are loaded with B vitamins <br /> • Eggs have minerals and trace minerals<br /> • Eggs contain carotenoids <br /><br />Follow Me On Social Media:<br />Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/FB-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/FB-DrBerg</a><br />Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/IG-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/IG-DrBerg</a><br />Anchor:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Anchor-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/Anchor-DrBerg</a><br />TikTok:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/TikTok-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/TikTok-DrBerg</a><br /><br />ADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description">https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description</a><br /><br />FREE COURSE➜ ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse">http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse</a><br /><br />Talk to a Dr. Berg Keto Consultant today and get the help you need on your journey.
