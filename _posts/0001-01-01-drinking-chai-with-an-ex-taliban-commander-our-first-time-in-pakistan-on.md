{% raw %}ðŸ‡µðŸ‡° Our first time in Pakistan, on our very first day, we happened to stumble across this Quetta chai shop that you see in this video. All the workers were characters, but one man in particular, Fazaldil, was the biggest character, haha. He ended up creating the famous &quot;shining wala&quot; mean that you all hear me talking about in my videos. So today, we came back to search for him.
