{% raw %}Former senior Washington official David Stilwell says former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo would make a “great president” as the build-up to the 2023 presidential election begins. <br /><br />Despite taking a vow of non-partisanship as a former military member, he said Mr Pompeo was a “fantastic leader”.<br /><br />“He gave us a lot of latitude to get a lot of stuff done, I think he would make a great president but there are a number of other candidates who would do just as well,” he told Sky News host Sharri Markson. <br /><br />“It’s the clear vision and the ability to execute is what you need as the leader of the free world.”{% endraw %}
