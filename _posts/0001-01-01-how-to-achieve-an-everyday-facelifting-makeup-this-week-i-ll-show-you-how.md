I only show you products that I love and really believe in. Each product I use is heavily researched before deciding to make a film and I try and provide you with as much accurate information as possible. The views on Speed Beauty are my own and are based on having personally tried the products myself.<br /><br />The products I use in these films are either bought by myself, are part of my professional kit or they’ve been sent to me by PR companies for review. I am not currently paid for producing the films you watch. Some of the films contain affiliate links in the description, but not all. If you are happy to click on these links to continue support Speed Beauty that would be very lovely, thank you.<br /><br />You should always research whether the products I recommend are suited to you. Everyones skin is different and I offer no warranties and don’t claim to be a dermatologist. Some products are really expensive and an investment purchase so it’s always wise to test product on your skin to check for allergies or adverse reactions before you buy. Some make up &amp; skin care brands offer you samples to take away &amp; try. This is always a good idea before deciding on an expensive purchase.<br /><br />Stay Connected:<br />Speed Beauty FaceBook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en-gb.facebook.com/CarolineBarnesSpeedBeauty/">https://en-gb.facebook.com/CarolineBarnesSpeedBeauty/</a><br />Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/carolinebarnesmakeup/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/carolinebarnesmakeup/?hl=en</a><br />Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CarolineBmakeup">https://twitter.com/CarolineBmakeup</a><br />Website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.carolinebarnes.co.uk">http://www.carolinebarnes.co.uk</a>{% endraw %}
