{% raw %}Unfortunately, due to some technical mishaps, we are only able to offer Fr. Mike Schmitz's homily for the 8th Sunday in Ordinary Time this weekend. We apologize for this temporary difficulty. We understand that many of you join the virtual front pew for Fr. Mike's Mass every Sunday—and some of you are unable to attend Mass in-person right now, for a variety of reasons. We anticipate being back to normal next Sunday—the First Sunday of Lent—and we truly appreciate your patience and understanding.<br /><br />If you are unable to attend Holy Mass in person, please consider streaming it from our friends at EWTN: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/EWTN">https://www.youtube.com/user/EWTN</a><br /><br />If you would also like to make a donation to the Newman Catholic Campus Ministries at the University of Minnesota Duluth, you can donate here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bulldogcatholic.org/donate/">https://bulldogcatholic.org/donate/</a><br /><br />Finally, we also ask you to continue supporting your local parishes. Thank you and God bless you!<br /><br />📖 You can follow along with readings here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/readings/022722.cfm">https://bible.usccb.org/bible/readings/022722.cfm</a><br /><br />🙏 See below for the Act of Spiritual Communion:<br /><br />My Jesus, <br />I believe that You<br />are present in the Most Holy Sacrament. <br />I love You above all things, <br />and I desire to receive You into my soul. <br />Since I cannot at this moment<br />receive You sacramentally, <br />come at least spiritually into my heart. I embrace You as if You were already there and unite myself wholly to You. Never permit me to be separated from You.<br /><br />Amen.<br /><br />—  MORE FROM ASCENSION  —<br /><br />🔸Ascension’s main website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/y7cj32ay">https://tinyurl.com/y7cj32ay</a><br />🔸Ascension Media: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/yb4ye2wm">https://tinyurl.com/yb4ye2wm</a><br />🔸The Great Adventure Bible: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/yb4ye2wm">https://tinyurl.com/yb4ye2wm</a><br /><br />—  SOCIAL MEDIA  —<br /><br />🔸Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/AscensionPress/">https://www.facebook.com/AscensionPress/</a><br />🔸Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/AscensionPress">http://twitter.com/AscensionPress</a><br />🔸LinkedIn:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/ascension-press">https://www.linkedin.com/company/ascension-press</a><br />🔸Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/catholicfaithformation/">http://www.instagram.com/catholicfaithformation/</a><br />🔸Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ascensionpresents">https://www.youtube.com/c/ascensionpresents</a><br /><br />—  BULLDOG CATHOLIC  —<br /><br />🔸YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzB400_Skw95z2TmAsSkIg">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXzB400_Skw95z2TmAsSkIg</a><br />🔸iTunes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/umd-newman-catholic-campus-ministry/id273537688">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/umd-newman-catholic-campus-ministry/id273537688</a>{% endraw %}
