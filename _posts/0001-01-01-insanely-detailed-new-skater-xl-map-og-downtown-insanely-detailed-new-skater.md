{% raw %}INSANELY Detailed New Skater XL map! (OG Downtown) This is a REALLY cool new Skater XL map made my Jean Olive. It has moving cars, animated NPC's, and some amazing skate spots. Jean Olive has been in the Skater XL modding scene for a while now with the famous Streets map, as well as a ton of other modded maps that myself and other Skater XL creators have shown in videos. This is one of many paid maps that you can get from Jean Olive's Discord, and I HIGHLY recommend you check it out if you haven't yet (link below).<br /><br />TUNE INTO MY STREAMS LIVE!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitch.tv/garrettginnerlive">http://www.twitch.tv/garrettginnerlive</a><br /><br />BECOME A MEMBER OF THE CHANNEL: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqjFp0sgTYc8eU24tTuM9rg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqjFp0sgTYc8eU24tTuM9rg/join</a><br /><br />JEAN OLIVES' DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/sGCP4KM5b8">https://discord.gg/sGCP4KM5b8</a><br /><br />DONATE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://streamlabs.com/garrettginner/tip">https://streamlabs.com/garrettginner/tip</a><br /><br />S4SHKO'S SOCIALS:<br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/UzFa3Zx">https://discord.gg/UzFa3Zx</a><br />Insta: @s4shko.3d<br /><br />SHOP CLOTHES: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.falkinco.com">http://www.falkinco.com</a><br />@garrettginner on all socials<br />Gaming insta: @garrettginnergaming <br /><br />DISCORD:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/V7ZReJX">https://discord.gg/V7ZReJX</a><br /><br />Oh, you're still reading the description? That's kinda weird. I guess I'll tell you a bit about myself. My name is Garrett Ginner, I like skateboarding, playing video games, and having fun. I have my main channel where I post vlogs and that kinda stuff, and I decided to start this channel because I've always had a love for playing video games. Now, I'm not actually good at any video games, so I spend a lot of my time playing action games like Skater XL, Descenders, Beam NG, Skate 3, etc. but I'm always looking for new games to play. Ok I really don't know what to type here so I'm just gonna stop. Bye now.<br /><br />#garrettginnergaming #gaming #skaterxl #ogdowntown{% endraw %}
