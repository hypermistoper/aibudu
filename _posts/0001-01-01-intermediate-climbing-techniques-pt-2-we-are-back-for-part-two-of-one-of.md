{% raw %}We are back for part two of one of our most popular videos ever! In this episode Josh and Jen revisit the topic of intermediate climbing techniques. Here we discuss the why's, when's and how's of flagging and toe hooking techniques. Both essential climbing techniques to master if trying to progress your climbing performance. This compliments our previous video (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/iqAgfCx2Sqo)">https://youtu.be/iqAgfCx2Sqo)</a> where we discussed twisting and heel hooking. We also run though the tactic we use when trying to flash hard boulders. Flashing boulders is a skill all climbers should practise because it helps hone your skills for recognizing movement options, building commitment and adapting intuitively to new movement options. We cover things like route reading, visualisation and being able to adapt your plan. <br /><br />Find out more about our Lattice Training Plans here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://latticetraining.com/plans/">https://latticetraining.com/plans/</a><br /><br />Download the Crimpd App:<br />App store - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crimpd/id1252333138">https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/crimpd/id1252333138</a><br />Google Play - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crimpd.ui">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.crimpd.ui</a>{% endraw %}
