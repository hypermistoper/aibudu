When he took over in the 70’s, he anticipated after 10 years of hard work, he could move the business out of the basement and into a real storefront. Unfortunately, it took until 2018 for that to happen, but hey at least it happened! Steve and Terry own the shop, Craig (the social media manager) is their son, Cara (wrapper and shipper extraordinaire who is poised to take over the shop one day) is their daughter and Leah (who doesn’t love being on camera and is very elusive) is their oldest daughter. Karen has been working for Hercules Candy since the twins (Craig and Cara) were about 6 months old and everybody else is a new recruit.
