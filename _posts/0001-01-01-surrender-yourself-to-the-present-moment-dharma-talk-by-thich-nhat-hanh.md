{% raw %}The monastic community is practicing during the Rainy Season Retreat from January 4 to March 14 at Deer Park Monastery with the lay community. This 55-minute dharma talk in the Ocean of Peace Meditation Hall takes place on Wednesday, January 14, 2004 during the second week. <br /><br />We begin with a reminder of the gatha we learned in the prior dharma talk. The gatha can be used when we are practicing sitting mediation, standing, walking, and lying down - the four positions of the body. We can listen to the music of our breathing in and breathing out. <br /><br />This is practice of stopping. This does just mean stopping the mind, but it also applies to our body. Because our body also has a habit of running; a feeling of restlessness in the body. And the body contains the mind along with the mind containing the body. Helping the body to stop is also helping the mind to stop. And this is why meditation includes the body. The Buddhist term for stopping is samatha.  We also need some insight, vipasyana, in order to truly stop. These are like two wings of a bird.<br /><br />The first insight is to stop running. Being in a retreat environment is a good opportunity to learn how to stop. With our practice of walking, each step is a healer. We can totally surrender ourself to the present moment. To the power of healing that is inherent in our body. In the Plum Village tradition, we offer the practice of total and deep relaxation. We use the techniques of mindful breathing to allow our body to rest. We embrace our body with tenderness. This is a practice of love. Darling, I am home. Thay takes us through some parts of meditation on the body. We also learn some of the exercises found in the Sutra on Contemplation of the Body in the Body. This practice can be very pleasant and healing. <br /><br />Stopping means to be fully present. In the here and the now. And when you are fully present in the here and now, then you are present to being fully alive. And vipasyana is what helps us to see this. Another function of samatha is to recognize: to recognize what is happening in the present moment. When we are able to recognize, then the &quot;blue sky&quot; is always there. We come to Deer Park so that we can learn to practice stopping. <br /><br />You can support us by:<br />- donating: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plumvillage.org/support">https://plumvillage.org/support</a><br />- helping to caption &amp; translate: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amara.org/en/profiles/videos/plumvillage/">https://amara.org/en/profiles/videos/plumvillage/</a> or <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?tab=2&amp;c=UCcv7KJIAsiddB2YRegvrF7g">http://www.youtube.com/timedtext_cs_panel?tab=2&amp;c=UCcv7KJIAsiddB2YRegvrF7g</a><br /><br />Help us caption &amp; translate this video!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amara.org/v/kj87/">https://amara.org/v/kj87/</a>{% endraw %}
