{% raw %}Head to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://keeps.com/dammitjeff">https://keeps.com/dammitjeff</a> to get 50% off your first order of hair loss treatment!<br /><br />In my hands I have a rare, modded OLED switch, and I'm going to show you what you can do with an modded switch, how to tell if your switch is moddable, and how to mod your OLED switch if you can do so. I also go over all the cool things you can do with a CFW switch, like game streaming, running android on a switch, and using custom firmwares to do all types of cool stuff like game modding on switch, among other things. This video took forever, and I really hope you enjoy how it came out!
