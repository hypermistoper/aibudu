{% raw %}Which kit, combo or package to get with the Mini 3 Pro. This time is different because normally you want the fly more kit for the extra battery and ND filters. But with the Mini 3 Pro, DJI isn't including ND filters in the fly more kits.<br /><br />That means you could just order the drone with whichever controller you want, then buy 1 extra battery and the ND filter package separately.<br />You really want a second battery no matter what, just trust me please.<br />You will need ND filters if you want to get pro footage or go down that path later on.<br />Those two are the only essentials.<br /><br />The Smart Controller that comes with the Mini 3 Pro is called the DJI RC. This is not the same as the big black one that comes with the Mavic 3 Cine (DJI RC PRO) but I STRONGLY recommend especially since its not much more for that package.<br /><br />This one is only compatible with the DJI Mini 3 Pro (RIGHT NOW)<br />When I was testing this drone before launch for DJI and I was using the beta version of the controller, it let me connect to Air 2S or Mavic 3, no clue why that was.<br />Maybe they were testing the feature, maybe it was just because I had the prototype software/controller and it isn't a feature that works very well.<br /><br />I'm hopeful (like we all are) that they add compatability for the Air 2S at least becuase that would be awesome.<br /><br />Right now only the DJI RC PRO smart controller can control the Mavic 3, Mavic 3 Cine, and Air 2S.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://click.dji.com/ACI02moOCwyTM32dfE4ZZQ?ch=launch-mini3pro&amp;pm=custom">https://click.dji.com/ACI02moOCwyTM32dfE4ZZQ?ch=launch-mini3pro&amp;pm=custom</a>{% endraw %}
