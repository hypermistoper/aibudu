{% raw %}In this video lesson, we will show why artificially high stresses arise in structural finite element models. Typical cases of these are from point loads and constraints, re-entrant corners, over-constrain of the model, and sharp corners in contact. Knowing to look out for these and understanding how to address them will better equip us to use our simulation tools and interpret results properly. We deliver a short lecture, then get into Ansys Mechanical to illustrate the concepts on a mechanical part.<br /><br />// INTERESTED IN MORE? <br />Visit Ansys Innovation Courses for free courses that include videos, handouts, simulation examples with starting files, homework problems and quizzes.  <br /><br />Visit today → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3Eo8esU">https://bit.ly/3Eo8esU</a> <br /><br />// DOWNLOAD FREE ANSYS SOFTWARE <br />Ansys offers free student product downloads for homework, capstone projects, student competitions, online learning and more!  <br /><br />Download today → <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/32eEcuR">https://bit.ly/32eEcuR</a> <br /><br />// QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS VIDEO OR USING ANSYS? <br />Get help from Ansys experts and peers through the Ansys Learning Forum.
