Its bright core emits light that takes 26,000 years to reach Earth. The core is also home to the supermassive black hole called Sagittarius A*.<br /><br />We spent over 200 hours capturing about 50,000 long exposure photos, then rendered into this ultra HD resolution timelapse film. <br /><br />Sit back, relax, and dream of the starsâ€¦{% endraw %}
