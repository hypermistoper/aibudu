{% raw %}Sky News Business Editor Ross Greenwood says the interest rates “need dealing with” by the Reserve Bank of Australia as it faces “enormous pressure”. <br /><br />“Prices are rising, it’s now up to the Reserve Bank to react,” he told Sky News Australia. <br /><br />Mr Greenwood said both sides of politics will be bargaining on how to manage the economy, especially with the predicted rise of interest rates within the election campaign period. <br /><br />“I think that’s going to be something that clearly will change, if you like, the focus and the nature of the debate inside the election this year.”{% endraw %}
