The new front end suspensions, choice of design and quality in their cars, as well as style and design, were big sellers for consumers.  These Historical Ford Reels break down the car by showcasing their engines, design, durability, capacity, and more.  <br />Taken From Wikipedia<br />&quot;The long-lived Flathead V8 engine was replaced for 1954 by a 239 cubic inch overhead valve Y-block unit, marking the end of an era. This engine produced 130 hp (97 kW) with a 2-barrel carburetor. An impressive 160 hp (119 kW) 256 C.I. version with a Holley four-barrel was available in the official-use-only law enforcement model. The six-cylinder was up to 223 cu in (3.7 L) and now produced 115 hp.[8] Another new addition was the &quot;Crestline Skyliner&quot; 2-door hardtop, which featured an acrylic glass panel over the front half of the roof. Also added was the new &quot;Astra-Dial Control panel&quot; speedometer, which has a clear, plastic covering on the top, which let sunlight illuminate it in the day-time.[9] New power accessories included a four-way power front seat.[2] The &quot;woody&quot; Country Squire wagon now used artificial fiberglass panels but remained the most-expensive Ford.” . <br /> . <br />#classiccarchannel . <br /><br />What I use to grow on YouTube<br />Vid-IQ -  Keyword SEO  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vidiq.com/tvgeyser">https://vidiq.com/tvgeyser</a><br />Canva - Great Thumbnails   - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3KZWql0">https://bit.ly/3KZWql0</a> <br />Prodvigate - Get Your Videos Discovered  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://prdvgt.com/TVGEY59125">https://prdvgt.com/TVGEY59125</a> <br />Fiverr  - Video Making Services - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fvrr.co/3o0m5QV">https://fvrr.co/3o0m5QV</a><br /> .{% endraw %}
