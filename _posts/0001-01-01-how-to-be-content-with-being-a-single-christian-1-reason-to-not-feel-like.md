{% raw %}Listen up Christian singles! Was the Apostle Paul single? YES! It can be a blessing to be single!<br /><br />Jack from @christianconvos joins me once again for this Mental Health Monday, where we tackle psychology from a Christian perspective. Should a Christian be considered a failure if they are single? The Apostle Paul was single. Many online dating websites like Christian Mingle or even dating apps like Upward can set this expectation that we can have a relationship just like the ones we see on Hallmark, or more familiar to our Christian circles - Paul and Morgan. Christians should not be caught up in dating. <br /><br />Other questions answered: Does the Bible say anything about Christian singles? Should Christian singles feel like a failure? Am I a failure for being single? Why do I feel like a failure for being single? Why do I care so much about being single? Why do so many Christians rush into marriage? What is the #1 relationship a Christian should be concerned about.<br /><br />MENTAL HEALTH MONDAY REQUEST FORM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://forms.gle/7qP2VA8yBM5LwftBA">https://forms.gle/7qP2VA8yBM5LwftBA</a><br /><br />üìñ FREE BIBLE ONLINE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/">https://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/</a><br /><br />üîî SUBSCRIBE:<br />‚ñ∫ JORDAN Revivalists for Christ: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/revivalistsforChrist?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/revivalistsforChrist?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />‚ñ∫ JACK ChristianConvos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/ChristianConvos?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/ChristianConvos?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />DONATION LINKS:<br />üíô Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/RevivalistsForChrist">https://www.patreon.com/RevivalistsForChrist</a><br />üíú PayPal: RevivalistsForChrist@gmail.com<br /><br />üôå Get a FREE 30 Day Devotional here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dedicated-thinker-970.ck.page/38ff4edddb">https://dedicated-thinker-970.ck.page/38ff4edddb</a><br /><br />FOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA:<br />‚úÖ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/RFChrist10">https://twitter.com/RFChrist10</a><br />‚úÖ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rfchrist10/">https://www.instagram.com/rfchrist10/</a><br />‚úÖ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RFChrist10">https://www.facebook.com/RFChrist10</a><br /><br />üôè Email me with any questions, comments, and/or prayer requests: <br />RevivalistsForChrist@gmail.com<br /><br />üìñ SCRIPTURE REFERENCED IN THE VIDEO:<br /><br />‚ñ∫ 1 Corinthians 7 (King James Version)<br />(v. 7-9) For I would that all men were even as I myself. But every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner, and another after that. I say therefore to the unmarried and widows, it is good for them if they abide even as I. But if they cannot contain, let them marry: for it is better to marry than to burn.<br />(v. 32-35) But I would have you without carefulness. He that is unmarried careth for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may please the Lord: But he that is married careth for the things that are of the world, how he may please his wife. There is difference also between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman careth for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit: but she that is married careth for the things of the world, how she may please her husband. And this I speak for your own profit; not that I may cast a snare upon you, but for that which is comely, and that ye may attend upon the Lord without distraction.{% endraw %}
