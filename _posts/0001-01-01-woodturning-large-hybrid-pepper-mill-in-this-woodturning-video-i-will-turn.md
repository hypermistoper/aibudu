{% raw %}In this woodturning video, I will turn an incredible looking large hybrid pepper mill out of some kiln dried elm burl and epoxy resin. Resin was mixed with ocean blue mica powder. I used CrushGrind original ceramic mechanism for ultimate quality and long lifetime. The outside was coasted with resin for extra durability and shine. ðŸ˜Š <br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.davidswoodturning.co.uk">https://www.davidswoodturning.co.uk</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/davidswoodturning">https://www.instagram.com/davidswoodturning</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/DavidsWoodturningUK">https://www.facebook.com/DavidsWoodturningUK</a><br /><br />Von Hanke branding coins:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/vonHanke?coupon=DAVID10OFF">https://www.etsy.com/shop/vonHanke?coupon=DAVID10OFF</a><br /><br />10% OFF on Starbond Glue Website<br />Use Code: DSWT10<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.starbond.com/?rfsn=5612082.c38978&amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=5612082.c38978">https://www.starbond.com/?rfsn=5612082.c38978&amp;utm_source=refersion&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_campaign=5612082.c38978</a> <br /><br />In the future I would like to share my creations with the audience here ranging from both simple woodturning ideas ideal for beginners but also more complex and artistic works for those like a bit of challenge. ðŸ˜Š <br />Please support my channel by subscribing and hit the notification bell button so you will not miss my future projects. <br />Thanks for watching and see you back soon for my next weekly video ðŸ˜Š <br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Please do not solely rely upon the information and techniques discussed and displayed in my channel.
