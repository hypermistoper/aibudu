{% raw %}In this final segment on Salesforce Opportunities, Shell dives into two related lists: Stage History and Contact Roles.  He goes over what is tracked in Stage History (Stage, Amount, Probability, and Close Date), and how you can use this information to see how an Opportunity has been progressing through the sales process (or not!). He then looks at Contact Roles -- where we identify all the players on a particular deal. Shell highlights through various scenarios how Contact Roles can change Opportunity by Opportunity, that the Contacts can be from different Accounts, the purpose of the primary checkbox, and the importance of defining the values in the Contact Role picklist for your organization.  Also covered are the instances when Contact Roles are created for you automatically (e.g. during Lead Conversion).<br /><br />To see a transcription of this video and additional show links, see the full blog post on ShellBlack.com - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shellblack.com/whiteboard/salesforce-opportunities-part-4-stage-history-and-contact-roles/">https://www.shellblack.com/whiteboard/salesforce-opportunities-part-4-stage-history-and-contact-roles/</a>{% endraw %}
