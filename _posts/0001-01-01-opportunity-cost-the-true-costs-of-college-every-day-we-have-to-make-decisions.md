{% raw %}Every day, we have to make decisions, be it small, like trying a new soap, or huge, like moving abroad. Each such decision comes at a price. This price is the benefit we forego by not choosing the other option. Economists call these benefits ‚Äúopportunity costs‚Äù. Although they are often less obvious and sometimes speculative, opportunity costs can be huge, therefore, learning about them makes sense! Watch our video to learn more about what opportunity costs are, how they work in real life, and how you can calculate the true costs of going to college.<br /><br />SUPPORT us to discover more econ concepts! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/sprouts">https://www.patreon.com/sprouts</a>  üê¶:<br /><br />DOWNLOAD video without ads and background music ü§´:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sproutsschools.com/video-lessons/">https://sproutsschools.com/video-lessons/</a><br /><br />SIGN UP to our mailing list and never miss a new video from us üîî:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://eepurl.com/dNU4BQ">http://eepurl.com/dNU4BQ</a> <br /><br />SOURCES and teaching resources üéì:<br />Link to blog post is coming soon!<br /><br />VISIT our website :<br />www.sproutsschools.com<br /><br />CONTRIBUTE by upvoting your favorite topic or suggesting new ones :<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://sprouts.featureupvote.com/">https://sprouts.featureupvote.com/</a><br /><br />THANKS to our patrons <br />Andrea Basilio Rava, Angela, Ann Hufstader, Artur, Badrah, Brilliant Minds Learning, C, Cedric.Wang, Daniel Kramer, Denis Kraus, Digital INnov8ors, Esther Chiang, Eva Marie Koblin, Gatsby Dkdc, Ginger, Hal Beltran, ICH KANN DEUTSCH UND ES WAR EINFACH!, Jannes Kroon, Jeffrey Cassianna, Joanne Doyle, Johan Klassen, Jonathan Schwarz, Jorge Luis Mejia Velazquez, Juliet Hutchings, L Efre, Liskaya, Marcel, Marco VanGuff, Margaret Grace, Mar√≠a, Marq Short, Mathis Nu, Mezes.Macko, Muhammad Humayun, Nicki, Okan Elibol, Petra, Raymond Fujioka, Reynir √ñrn Bachmann Gu√∞mundsson, Robert Cook, scripz, Si, Stephen, Stephen Clark, Stefan Gros, Susan Schuster, Tetiana Gerasymova, Tristan Scifo, Victor Paweletz, Wolfgang Vullhorst, Yvonne Clapham and all the others.Thank you!
