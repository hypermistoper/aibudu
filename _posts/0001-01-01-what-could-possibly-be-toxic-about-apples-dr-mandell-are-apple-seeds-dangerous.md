{% raw %}Are Apple Seeds Dangerous?  Eating a few apple seeds is safe. However, eating or drinking large quantities of ground or crushed seeds could be problematic. I will explain more detail about this in the video. Dr. M<br /><br />Research suggests that eating some apple on a daily basis can help lower levels of cholesterol as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), a key marker of inflammation in the blood.  Lowering inflammation is the key player helping the arteries. The research shows how the polyphenols affects the LDL‚Äòs (bad cholesterol) in the arteries. The trick is to stop oxidation of unhealthy lipoproteins, or LDL. Those particles carry cholesterol into the bloodstream and help build plaque deposits in arteries. If oxidation can be delayed, the body has a better chance of flushing out LDL particles. A compound found in apples apparently slows this oxidation.<br />Although it is important as with any other food you should be eating a healthy diet, getting exercise, enough sleep,  hydrating, and minimizing stress as much as possible.<br /><br />Apples are an important contributor to the intake of dietary components linked with cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention. Apples have been shown to have beneficial effects on vascular function, blood pressure, lipids, inflammation and hyperglycemia. The cardioprotective effects of apples,<br />and other fruits, have been primarily ascribed to their high polyphenol content. <br /><br />Please subscribe so you and your family can stay healthy and happy.   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc">https://www.youtube.com/user/motivationaldoc</a><br /><br />Please share this video with your friends and family.
