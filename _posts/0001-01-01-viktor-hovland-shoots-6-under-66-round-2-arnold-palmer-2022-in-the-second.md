{% raw %}In the second round of the 2022 Arnold Palmer Invitational presented by Mastercard, Viktor Hovland shot a 6-under 66 to get to 9-under through 36 holes, leading by two shots going into the weekend.<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to PGA TOUR now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh">http://pgat.us/vBxcZSh</a><br /><br /><br /><br />The 2022 edition of the Arnold Palmer Invitational is set to be a humdinger, as a whole host of previous winners look to repeat their past triumphs at the notoriously tricky Bay Hill Club &amp; Lodge in Florida. These include 2018 winner Rory McIlroy who has achieved top 10 finish in each of his last five visits to Bay Hill and Tyrell Hatton who claimed his first and only PGA TOUR win at the event in 2020. With World No.1, Jon Rahm’s last victory coming at the 2021 US Open, the Spaniard will be keen to continue the recent trend of non-US winners at Bay Hill, with five out of the last six victors coming from outside of the United States. With no-one breaking 70 on the final round of last year’s tournament, a fast start might prove pivotal in deciding who comes out on top. Other prominent names to look out for include current FedExCup leader Hideki Matsuyama, 2017 winner Marc Leishman and Scottie Scheffler who arrives in Florida in great form, having won the WM Phoenix Open, followed by a T7 finish at the Genesis Open. <br /><br /><br /><br />Welcome to the official YouTube channel of the PGA TOUR.
