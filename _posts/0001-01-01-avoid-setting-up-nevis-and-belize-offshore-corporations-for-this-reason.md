{% raw %}Visit:<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.citizenshipquickly.com">https://www.citizenshipquickly.com</a><br />Belize and Nevis Offshore Corporations will now be having annual tax returns to file each year and CORPORATE taxes that are high in my opinion especially in the case of Nevis at 33%. Limited Companies will have the same tax. Probaby the dumbest thing the Federation ever did was caving in to the CRS DUMMIES. THAT BUSINESS WILL JUST GO TO THE SMART NON COMPLIANT CRS COUNTRIES THAT WON'T GIVE IN. If you would like to legally get your income taxes to zero or to get a second passport in as quick as 45 days, go to the above website and hit the button on the top of the page and click on the tab that says APPLY WITH US and then fill out the questions and then hit the button on bottom that says SEND IT TO US and we will get back to you to help solve your problem. Thank you.{% endraw %}
