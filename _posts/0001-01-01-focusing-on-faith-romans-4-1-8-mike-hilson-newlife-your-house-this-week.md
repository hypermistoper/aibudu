{% raw %}This week we jump into Romans chapter 4 and learn about how God dealt with Abraham and figure out more about how we plans to deal with us. Preaching by Pastor Mike Hilson. Hosted by Dave Sylvain and Emily Bradford. Worship by the NL@YH worship team. <br /><br />Scripture Reference:<br />Romans 4:1-8<br />1 What then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, discovered in this matter? <br />2 If, in fact, Abraham was justified by works, he had something to boast about—but not before God. <br />3 What does Scripture say? “Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness.”<br />4 Now to the one who works, wages are not credited as a gift but as an obligation. <br />5 However, to the one who does not work but trusts God who justifies the ungodly, their faith is credited as righteousness. <br />6 David says the same thing when he speaks of the blessedness of the one to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:<br />7 “Blessed are those<br />whose transgressions are forgiven,<br />whose sins are covered.<br />8 Blessed is the one<br />whose sin the Lord will never count against them.”<br /><br />Chapters: <br />0:00 Intro<br />0:21 Host <br />6:35 Worship <br />26:16 Host <br />30:12 Sermon <br />58:46 Host <br />1:04:31 Kid's Service <br />1:14:50 Outro<br /><br />NEWLIFE @ Your House is an online experience and watch party movement that invites people to actively love God and each other better everyday, wherever they are located, through multiplying communities that practice service and generosity.
