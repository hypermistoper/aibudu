{% raw %}Disney is turning its back on wokeness moving forward according to a source, and a recent news story out of Florida may well be proof that this is so. I've been pointing out that we are winning the war on woke for years now, reporting on rumors from my Hollywood spies that Disney is turning its back on agenda politics, and while mega corporations like Disney move very slowly, it does seem like finally this rumor is being proven true, and once again, Doomcock was right. Here's the latest dispatch from the front lines, but it's looking increasingly like wokeness is no longer going to be promoted at Disney! #disney #chapek #DisneyNews<br /><br />Join the DC Legion my friends!
