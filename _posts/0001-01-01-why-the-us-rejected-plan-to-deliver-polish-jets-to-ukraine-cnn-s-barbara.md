{% raw %}CNN's Barbara Starr explains why the Pentagon rejected a plan proposed by Poland to send a Polish fleet of MiG-29 jets to Ukraine via a US base in Germany.<br />The Pentagon dismissed Poland's proposal floated hours earlier to transfer its MiG-29 fighter jets to the United States for delivery to Ukraine.<br />Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said in a statement that the Pentagon did not believe Poland's proposal was &quot;tenable,&quot; just hours after Polish officials released a statement saying the government was ready to deploy all of its MiG-29 fighter jets to US Air Force's Rammstein Air Base in Germany so they could then be provided to Ukraine in its fight against Russia.<br />&quot;It is simply not clear to us that there is a substantive rationale for it,&quot; Kirby said. &quot;We will continue to consult with Poland and our other NATO allies about this issue and the difficult logistical challenges it presents, but we do not believe Poland's proposal is a tenable one.&quot;<br />Kirby said that the decision about transferring Polish-owned planes to Ukraine was &quot;ultimately one for the Polish government,&quot; adding that the proposal shows the complexities that the issue presents as Russia has made threatening statements over arms being provided to Ukrainians for use against Russian forces.<br />The idea as laid out by Poland was too risky, Kirby said, as the US and NATO seek to avoid an outright conflict between the alliance and Russia.<br />#Ukraine #NewDay #CNN{% endraw %}
