{% raw %}We will go through 24 different ways in which Jesus fulfilled the Jewish Feast of Passover. Passover was given by God in the Old Testament and fulfilled by Jesus in the New. I hope this teaching stirs your heart with appreciation for the brilliance of the Bible as well as the incredible, loving self-sacrifice of Christ for our sins. He is our Passover and we are forgiven because of His offering. <br /><br />The full Jesus in the Old Testament Playlist (this is my absolute favorite series) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHsHyvMtfgOgSPU6zEnCvxUO">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ3iRMLYFlHsHyvMtfgOgSPU6zEnCvxUO</a><br />My web site - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://BibleThinker.org">https://BibleThinker.org</a><br />Check out the FREE BibleThinker app in your app store.{% endraw %}
