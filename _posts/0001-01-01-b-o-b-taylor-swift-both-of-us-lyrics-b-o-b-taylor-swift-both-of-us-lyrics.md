Iâ€™m just askin'<br />Whatâ€™s the pattern to the madness?<br />Everybody ainâ€™t a number one draft pick<br />Most of us ainâ€™t Hollywood actors<br />But if itâ€™s all for one, and one for all<br />Then maybe one day, we all could ball<br />Do it one time for the underdogs<br />Sincerely yours, from one of y'all<br /><br />[Chorus: Taylor Swift]<br />I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us<br />Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us<br /><br />[Verse 2: B.o.B]<br />I could feel your pain, I could feel your struggle<br />You just wanna live, but everything's so low<br />That you could drown in a puddle<br />Thatâ€™s why I gotta hold us up, yeah, hold us up<br />For all the times no oneâ€™s ever spoke for us<br />To every single time that they play this song<br />You can say that thatâ€™s what Bobby Ray wrote for us<br />When the tides get too high<br />And the sea up underneath gets so deep<br />And you feel like youâ€™re just another person<br />Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds<br />Uh, because we've both been there, both of us<br />But we still stand tall with our shoulders up<br />And even though we always against the odds<br />These are the things thatâ€™ve molded us<br />And if life hadnâ€™t chosen us<br />Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up<br />'Cause if it was up to me, Iâ€™d make a new blueprint<br />Then build it from the ground up, hey<br />But if itâ€™s all for one, and one for all<br />Then maybe one day, we all could ball<br />Do it one time for the underdogs<br />From Bobby Ray, to all of yâ€™all<br /><br />[Chorus: Taylor Swift]<br />I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us<br />Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us<br /><br />- - - - - - - - -<br />&quot;If you'd like to submit a video to the channel, please visit:<br />please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.unitedframes.tv/superb">https://www.unitedframes.tv/superb</a><br />Or contact samuel@unitedframes.tv&quot;<br />- - - - - - - - - - - -<br />ðŸ“· Wallpaper: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://unsplash.com">https://unsplash.com</a><br />- - - - - - - - - - - -â€‹<br />My Spotify Playlist ðŸŽµðŸŽµ <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3RR...">https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3RR...</a><br /><br />#BothOfUs #BoB #TaylorSwift{% endraw %}
