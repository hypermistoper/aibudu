The human experience in all of its gory and real manifestations. It would have been so much easier to hide this issue I've been having, but I know how many other people there are out there, struggling with something. I figured that maybe by me being raw and honest with you guys, you will realize we all have our battles and what you see on social media is (mostly) what people want you to see. The highlights. This is not a highlight of mine. No one's life is perfect and if it appears that way, it's not true. Don't be fooled.<br />Thanks for allowing me the space to be vulnerable with you guys. ❤️ Thanks for loving and supporting me, for me! <br />- Elayna<br /><br />Need more content from SLV?
