{% raw %}Wanaka is a wonderful and picturesque place. With snowcapped mountains and beautiful scenery, we absolutely loved waking up to the incredible views there. <br /><br />We arrived very late the previous night to our Airbnb so we started things off in this vlog with a quick tour of our accommodation in Wanaka. Mary's Airbnb had the most incredible mountain and lakeside views! It was such a modern, stylish, clean and comfortable place that we called home for 3 nights. Definitely a fantastic place to stay if you're visiting Wanaka.<br /><br />Mary's Airbnb<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.airbnb.co.nz/rooms/45901097">https://www.airbnb.co.nz/rooms/45901097</a><br /><br />We needed some food in us so found a nutritious whole foods place called Dripping Bowl. They offer healthy and delicious items such as buddha and smoothie bowls on their menu along with cold press juices and smoothies. Great place if you're wanting something healthy and refreshing to kick start your day.<br /><br />Dripping Bowl<br />Address: 82 Anderson Road, Wanaka 9305<br />Hours: Sun‚ÄìThu 7am‚Äì3:30pm<br />Fri &amp; Sat 8am‚Äì2:30pm<br /><br />When searching for things to do in Wanaka, Puzzling World kept popping up as a weird and wacky, unique activity to check out. We had a great time in the illusion rooms and even attempted the great maze too. It really was a wonderful, world of weirdness! <br /><br />Puzzling World<br />Address: 188 Wanaka-Luggate Highway, Wanaka 9382<br />Hours: Mon‚ÄìSun 9am‚Äì4:30pm<br /><br />Another &quot;top things to do in Wanaka&quot; recommendation that we kept coming across was the Wanaka Lavender Farm. Although we weren't really in the right season to see the lavenders in bloom (you need to visit in summer for that), it was still a lovely place to visit and spend our afternoon wandering through the farm. They have an awesome gift shop with lavender products handmade right there at their Wanaka Lavender Farm too.<br /><br />Wanaka Lavender Farm<br />Address: 36 Morris Road, Wanaka 9382<br />Hours: Mon‚ÄìSun 9am‚Äì5pm<br /><br />We ended our day by visiting that Wanaka tree again. Definitely a must do when in Wanaka to see the iconic and famous tree. Stay tuned next week for our final vlog from the South Island!<br /><br />=============== <br />VLOG DATE: 24 Oct 2020<br />=============== <br /><br />Watch our other South Island road trip vlogs:<br /><br />Vlog 1/5<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/40igP4A19G4">https://youtu.be/40igP4A19G4</a><br /><br />Vlog 2/5<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/hapPS-GAZ9k">https://youtu.be/hapPS-GAZ9k</a><br /><br />Vlog 3/5<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/FMwOvADOssI">https://youtu.be/FMwOvADOssI</a><br /><br />Vlog 5/5<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/qh75ATYTw08">https://youtu.be/qh75ATYTw08</a><br /> <br />#wanaka #newzealand #nz<br /><br />=============== <br /><br />SUPPORT US<br /><br />If you like the content we create and want to make a contribution to help out with our channel, we sincerely appreciate any donation as it goes directly into helping us continue to make our videos to share with everyone.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=XGH8V39AK8HWG">https://www.paypal.com/donate/?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=XGH8V39AK8HWG</a><br /><br />Your support means a lot to us and any contribution at all is amazing.
