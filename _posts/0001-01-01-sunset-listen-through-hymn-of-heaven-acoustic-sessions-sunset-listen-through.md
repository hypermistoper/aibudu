{% raw %}Sunset listen through of Phil Wickham's album Hymn Of Heaven (Acoustic Sessions). <br /><br />There’s a cliff near our home that overlooks the ocean. It’s become my family's “sunset spot”. We’ll pile into the van and head there to watch the sun come down over the Pacific, usually with some In N Out or ice cream in hand. It’s always a beautiful time together. I recorded Hymn Of Heaven (Acoustic Sessions) with that exact scene in mind. I actually have a photo of my kids at our “sunset spot” and throughout the project, I kept coming back to that photo. I wanted to make a version of Hymn Of Heaven that would be a soundtrack to those kinds of moments.<br /><br />Stream or download the album: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://fts.lnk.to/HOHAcoustic">https://fts.lnk.to/HOHAcoustic</a><br /><br />Don't forget to SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://smarturl.it/PWYouTubeSubscribe">https://smarturl.it/PWYouTubeSubscribe</a><br /><br />Connect With Phil Wickham:<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://smarturl.it/PW-Website">http://smarturl.it/PW-Website</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://smarturl.it/PW-Facebook">http://smarturl.it/PW-Facebook</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://smarturl.it/PW-Twitter">http://smarturl.it/PW-Twitter</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://smarturl.it/PW-Instagram">http://smarturl.it/PW-Instagram</a>{% endraw %}
