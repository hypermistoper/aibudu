{% raw %}We’re gonna be doing a shoe review today! I have five different pairs of sneakers that are pretty much recommended to everybody and anybody that works twelve plus hours or are on their feet all day! We’re talkin’ #HokaOneOne , #Brooks , New Balance, #Adidas , and Asics! I really enjoyed these shoes, but they all sort of have their pros and cons, however for me, comfort sort of trumps anything. I hope the video was helpful and thank you guys for watching!!<br /><br />Socks you NEED for extra cushion! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3g0CZe9">https://amzn.to/3g0CZe9</a><br /><br />Hoka One One Bondi 7 [8Wide]<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hokaoneone.com/womens-road/bondi-7/1110519.html">https://www.hokaoneone.com/womens-road/bondi-7/1110519.html</a><br /><br />Brooks Glycerin 19 [8.5Wide]<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2VJ2vhi">https://amzn.to/2VJ2vhi</a><br /><br />Adidas Ultraboost 20 [8]<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3xKKsE6">https://amzn.to/3xKKsE6</a><br /><br />New Balance 1080v111 [8.5]<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3xGHsZE">https://amzn.to/3xGHsZE</a><br /><br />Asics Gel Excite 7 [8]<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3AEHAe0">https://amzn.to/3AEHAe0</a><br /><br /><br />Thank y’all for watching!
