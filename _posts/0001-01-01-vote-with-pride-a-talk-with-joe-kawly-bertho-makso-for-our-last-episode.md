{% raw %}For our last episode before the elections this Sunday, we wanted to reach out to one of Lebanon's most vibrant, creative, deserving and colorful communities. Not to single out any group, but to stretch and include everyone. <br /><br />This is our message to every disenfranchised individual: The ballot box fits us all, and it brings our shared desire for equality and justice many steps closer. Use it, and vote!{% endraw %}
