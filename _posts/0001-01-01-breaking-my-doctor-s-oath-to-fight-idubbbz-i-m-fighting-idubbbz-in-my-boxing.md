{% raw %}I'm fighting iDubbbz in my boxing debut Saturday May 14th! Tickets for the in person event and stream here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thecreatorclash.com/">https://thecreatorclash.com/</a><br /><br />Over the last several months I have dedicated my time to training for my boxing debut, taking place Saturday May 14th in Tampa, Flordia against my fellow YouTuber, iDubbbz. While my support network has been strong, from friends and family to my professional coaching/nutrition team, I've still received a lot of confused looks and comments from people when I tell them I'm getting ready to fight. Why would a doctor, who knows the real risks that come with boxing, volunteer to participate in such a dangerous sport? Today I want to tell you why I'm driven to the sport and how I'm taking care of myself to limit the very real risks of fighting as much as possible. CTE is real, brain damage is real, lifelong trauma is real. Despite what iDubbbz might have said about me on the H3H3 podcast, I am taking this training seriously, and I think you'll all see what I mean come May 14th ;)<br /><br />I LOVE reading your comments and take your suggestions seriously.
