{% raw %}By popular demand, we are finally revisiting the idea of the &quot;Practical Rifle&quot;. But this time around, our take is a little different than the concept we presented five years ago. What if the most pressing need you have for a rifle is so you can defend your chickens and squash from small woodland creatures? If that's the case, then a suppressed .22 bolt action might be the most practical rifle you can own.<br /><br />The original Practical Rifle Videos:<br />Rethinking the Scout Rifle...
