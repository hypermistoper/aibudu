These fruits and vegetables are are some of the most sprayed ones around and tend to be high in pesticides, even after you clean them. On the other hand, the clean 15 is produce that you don't have to buy organic, you can get the conventional ones. I know it's expensive to buy organic, but I think some things are worth the extra money because you don't want to put those types of chemicals in your body. Mad love Bobby...Dessi...and Art!
