{% raw %}James Webb Space Telescope Discovered Thousands of Galaxies from First Image<br /><br />Itâ€™s not just a telescope, itâ€™s a space observatory described as a 'time machine'. Itâ€™s The James Webb Space Telescope and it will help unravel the secrets of our universe looking back to the first galaxies ever born. It will observe the sources of stars, exoplanets and their various moons, some of which date back to the earliest eras of our universe â€“ 13.5 billion years ago. Are you ready to travel outside our solar system? Buckle up! Hereâ€™s the details on the first images of the James Webb Space Telescope, and the thousands of galaxies it captured. <br /><br />Everyone enjoys a good photobomb, especially when our favorite superstars get involved. But with the James Webb Space Telescope or JWST, true stars take center stage, and even the superstars begin star gazing. On the opposite spectrum of a fluke photobomb, the scientists controlling the Webb Telescope have already carefully calculated all the shots they plan to take. And just in the very first photo, theyâ€™ve acquired a grand view of thousands of distant and ancient galaxies. All of them splattered over the entire photo. Itâ€™s a photo worthy of an art gallery, if not the title holder as the greatest â€˜photobombâ€™ in history. From the in-focused images to the out-of-focused, this first image from the James Webb Space Telescope includes documented and undocumented galaxies. Yes, take a deep breath. Some of these galaxies have never been seen until now!<br /><br />â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬â–¬<br />ðŸš€  Subscribe to Space Infinity to stay updated on the latest Space News!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SpaceInfinity?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/SpaceInfinity?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Space Infinity brings you the latest in space exploration, technology,  and innovation.
