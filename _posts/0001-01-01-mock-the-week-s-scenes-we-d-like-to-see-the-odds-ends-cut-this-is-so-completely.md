{% raw %}This is so completely out of order, because seriously, they were all over the place! DX<br /><br />This includes various versions of SWLTS from either extended versions of previous episodes and from the Christmas/New Years specials. (The Sports Relief SWLTS is prohibited by Base79 on Sport Relief's behalf. I can't include them as they were vehement on &quot;their&quot; copyright.) Repeats on appearance but the segments included suggestions that didn't make it to the final cut, and even includes the full incident with Ed Byrne from Series 4{% endraw %}
