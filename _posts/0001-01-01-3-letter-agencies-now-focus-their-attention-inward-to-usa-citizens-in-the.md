{% raw %}In the news constantly is how the Department of Homeland Security, or the FBI designates certain members of the population as domestic terrorists. When you actually investigate the detail of who are designated as such, they appear to only apply only to one political side. Though it is obvious in reality that violence and protests come from all sides.<br /><br />What is going on?<br /><br />Why is there a seemingly active  program to classify certain members of the population in a way reminiscent of the past, but done to the opposite side of the political spectrum? Have we forgotten our history? Wow, full circle.<br /><br />And this is good?<br /><br />-----------------------------------<br />BraX2 Privacy Phone is now available for $379. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://brax.me">https://brax.me</a><br />-----------------------------------<br />Merch Store (See the de-Googled shirt I was wearing)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://my-store-c37a50.creator-spring.com/">https://my-store-c37a50.creator-spring.com/</a><br />-----------------------------------<br /><br />I'm the Internet Privacy Guy.
