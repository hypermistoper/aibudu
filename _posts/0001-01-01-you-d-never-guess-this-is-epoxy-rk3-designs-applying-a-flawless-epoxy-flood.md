These tutorials include epoxy countertops for kitchens, bathrooms, and much more. This channel provides tutorials for DIYers, contractors, designers, or artists. <br /><br />Rhonda Dracoulis Founder and Primary Instructor<br />RK3 Designs started as a way for Rhonda to showcase her creativity but has blossomed into a way to help others find theirs. Her obsession with painting led her to start refinishing furniture and kitchen cabinets. She found customers wanted a nicer option than laminate but more affordable and customizable than natural stone, which lead her to countertop epoxy! Since then, she‚Äôs helped thousands of students, from across the country (and even Canada eh?).<br /><br />If you prefer a more hands-on learning experience, book a class with Rhonda today: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.RK3designs.com/book-online">https://www.RK3designs.com/book-online</a> RK3 offers numerous classes that cater to different levels of experience.<br /><br />To learn more about Epoxy and Rhonda follow us on our socials. <br />üëç   Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RK3Designs">https://www.facebook.com/RK3Designs</a><br />‚ù§Ô∏è  Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rk3designs">https://www.instagram.com/rk3designs</a> <br />üé®  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rk3designs.com/">https://www.rk3designs.com/</a><br /><br />**Amazon Affiliate Disclaimer.
