{% raw %}The Canadian Constitution Foundation is challenging the Trudeau government for its illegal invocation of the Emergencies Act and the unconstitutional orders issued under it, including the freezing of bank accounts.<br /><br />The Trudeau government invoked this extraordinary legislation, giving it powers that had a massive impact on Canadians' civil rights, and they are now saying they do not need to explain why they invoked it. The Trudeau government is arguing that they can keep the documents explaining why they invoked this law secret.<br /><br />This is not how we do law in Canada, and we are taking the government to court over it.<br /><br />The hearing to access these secret documents will take place in May, and the larger challenge to the illegal use of the Emergencies Act will take place in the summer.<br /><br />This case is complex, precedent setting, and expensive.
