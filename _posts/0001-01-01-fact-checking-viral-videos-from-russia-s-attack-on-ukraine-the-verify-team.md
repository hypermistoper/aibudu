{% raw %}The VERIFY team looks into two videos being attributed to Russia’s air attacks on Ukraine. <br /><br /><br /><br />QUESTION: Does this video show an aerial attack in Ukraine?<br /><br /><br /><br />ANSWER: This is false. We found the same video posted on Tiktok in October of 2021, four months before the invasion. The person who originally posted the video tagged it with “CGI,” suggesting that it is computer-generated. <br /><br /><br /><br />QUESTION: Does this video show Russian fighter jets flying over Ukraine?<br /><br /><br /><br />ANSWER: No, it does not. We found the origin of this video dating back to a YouTube post in May of 2020. On top of that, we sourced the video back to a Russian air force rehearsal in preparation of Victory Day back in May of that year. <br /><br /><br /><br />READ MORE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3Ip1Nsj">https://bit.ly/3Ip1Nsj</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />------------------------------<br /><br />At VERIFY, we're answering your questions about what's true and false.
