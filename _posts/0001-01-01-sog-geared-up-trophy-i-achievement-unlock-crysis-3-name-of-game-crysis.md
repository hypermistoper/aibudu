{% raw %}NAME OF GAME: Crysis 3<br />NAME OF UNLOCK: Geared - Up <br />UNLOCK DESCRIPTION: single player: Unlock All Weapon Attachments <br />DIFFICULTY: Any (Recruit)<br /><br />This is a detailed guide designed to help you get the trophy/achievement/unlock (Geared - Up) while playing Crysis 3. If you have any questions let me know in the comments below. Enjoy.<br /><br />**IMPORTANT**<br />If you are not starting your game with 00/20 then that means some of the guns I show you in this video may not be identical to the ones you're seeing in your game.  The reason why is because you probably already have unlocked the attachment already, and if you have, the name of the gun you are picking up will be named something different.  The name of the gun changes based on the attachments you have already unlocked.  The best thing for you to do is eliminate what attachments you have already unlocked and skip to the sections of this video the only applies to attachments you have not unlocked.  This will make things less confusing for you. :)<br /><br />TIMELINE:<br /><br />MISSION 01 - POST HUMAN<br />01-03 / 2:15<br />Weapon: Hammer II<br />Attachments: Iron Sights, Silencer, Rifle Laser Sight <br /><br />04-05 / 2:40<br />Weapon: Reflex Scar<br />Attachments: Reflex Sight, Single Shot<br /><br />06 / 4:37<br />Weapon: Ranged Scar <br />Attachment: Assault Scope<br /><br />MISSION 02 - WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE<br />07 / 5:37<br />Weapon: CQC Scarab<br />Attachment: Foregrip<br /><br />08 / 6:27  <br />Weapon: High Cap Scarab <br />Attachment: Extended Ammo Box (4mm) <br /><br />09 / 7:02 <br />Weapon: Spec Ops Feline <br />Attachment: Double Magazines (4.7mm)<br /><br />10 / 7:56  <br />Weapon: High Cap Feline <br />Attachment: Extended Magazine (4.7mm) <br /><br />11 / 8:52  <br />Weapon: Precision (Hammer II)<br />Attachment: Match Barrel<br /><br />MISSION 03 - THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL<br />12 / 9:47  <br />Weapon: DSG-1<br />Attachment: Sniper Scope<br /><br />13 / 10:47  <br />Weapon: Reflex Scar <br />Attachment: Muzzle Brake<br /><br />14 / 11:29  <br />Weapon: Thermal DSG-1<br />Attachment: Tech Scope<br /><br />**Possible Glitch Solution<br />12:18<br /><br />MISSION 04 - SAFETIES OFF<br />15 / 14:29  <br />Weapon: Scarab Mod 2<br />Attachment: Mini-Typhoon<br /><br />16 / 15:22  <br />Weapon: Marshall<br />Attachment: Bayonet<br /><br />MISSION 05 - RED STAR RISING<br />17 / 15:58  <br />Weapon: Alpha Jackal<br />Attachment: Double Magazines (12g)<br /><br />18 / 16:41  <br />Weapon: Scar Mod 2<br />Attachment: Grenade Launcher<br /><br />19 / 17:40  <br />Weapon: Alpha Jackal<br />Attachment: Extended Ammo Drum (12g)<br /><br />MISSION 06 - ONLY HUMAN (none)<br /><br />MISSION 07 - GODS AND MONSTERS<br />20 / 19:03<br />Weapon: M12 (Flashlight) Nova<br />Attachment: Flashlight <br /><br />UNLOCK pops at 19:03<br /><br />Also, feel free to check out my Interactive Hub for Crysis 3.
