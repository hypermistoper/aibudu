With offbeat humor and unflinching honesty, Married... paints a more realistic picture of middle-class existence, warts and all. Al Bundy (Ed O'Neill) is a shoe salesman who is fond of frequently reliving his doubtful 15 seconds of fame on the football field. Al is terrified of the all-too-frequent amorous advances of his ditsy wife Peggy (Katey Sagal), who spends most of Al's wages at the salon and the mall. They have two teenage kids: stunning but superficial party animal Kelly (Christina Applegate) and egocentric Bud (David Faustino). Married for 16 semi-blissful years, Peggy and Al have found that the secret to a happy marriage is to accept one another's idiosyncrasies.<br /><br />#MarriedWithChildren #90s #JustMarriedWithChildren<br /><br />Al &amp; Peg Appear On A Gameshow As Newly-Weds | Married With Children<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/officialmarriedwithchildren">https://www.youtube.com/officialmarriedwithchildren</a>{% endraw %}
