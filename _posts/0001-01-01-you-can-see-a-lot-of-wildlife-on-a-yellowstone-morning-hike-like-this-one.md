{% raw %}This is a hike in the Beaver Pond area of Yellowstone National Park.  Early this morning I saw wildlife every direction I looked.  It is a beautiful area this time of year and this video has a lot of great scenery.  Remember to always take your bear spray.<br />Here are some Amazon links to the equipment I use.
