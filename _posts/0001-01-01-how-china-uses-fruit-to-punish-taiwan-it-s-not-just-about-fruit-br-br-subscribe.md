Critics say pests are an excuse, and China is weaponizing trade with Taiwan. And this isnâ€™t the first time. In February of 2021, China banned the import of Taiwanese pineapples, causing a backlog and threatening farmers' livelihoods across the country. <br /><br />The current situation is tied to a complex history that goes back to the Chinese civil war, and to recent tensions that go back to 2016, when Taiwan elected a new president. Since then, Chinese military incursions into Taiwanâ€™s air space have been on the rise, and the relation between the two has kept deteriorating. Fruit is the latest expression of this. <br /><br />To understand how this atemoya ban impacts farmers in Taiwan, and how it all ties together, watch our video.    <br /><br />Sources and further reading:<br /><br />You can check out the data on Taiwanâ€™s fruit exports here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.producereport.com/article/2019-taiwan-fruit-import-export-statistics-released-exports-mainland-china-43">https://www.producereport.com/article/2019-taiwan-fruit-import-export-statistics-released-exports-mainland-china-43</a><br /><br />To read more about the pineapple campaign and how it played out, check this out:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-05/china-s-ban-on-taiwan-pineapples-backfires-as-new-buyers-step-in">https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-05/china-s-ban-on-taiwan-pineapples-backfires-as-new-buyers-step-in</a><br /><br />To read the Cross-Strait Agreement on Trade in Services, click here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mac.gov.tw/public/Data/3859414471.pdf">https://www.mac.gov.tw/public/Data/3859414471.pdf</a><br /><br />To understand the Sunflower Movement in more depth, read this:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/08/02/activist-legacy-of-taiwan-s-sunflower-movement-pub-76966">https://carnegieendowment.org/2018/08/02/activist-legacy-of-taiwan-s-sunflower-movement-pub-76966</a><br /><br />For a deeper look at Chinaâ€™s military incursions, check this out:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/15/asia/taiwan-invasion-us-china-tensions-intl-dst-hnk/index.html">https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/15/asia/taiwan-invasion-us-china-tensions-intl-dst-hnk/index.html</a><br /><br />Make sure you never miss behind the scenes content in the Vox Video newsletter, sign up here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vox.com/video-newsletter">http://vox.com/video-newsletter</a><br /><br />Vox.com is a news website that helps you cut through the noise and understand what's really driving the events in the headlines.
