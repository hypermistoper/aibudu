{% raw %}Homeowner Elizabeth Margles walks us through her light-filled main floor makeover designed by Odami. In the kitchen, light wood millwork and white quartz stone establish a clean, Scandi-style aesthetic. In the dining area, vintage chairs with warm wood accents ground the space, and a horizontal Willow pendant from Hollis &amp; Morris creates a unique focal point. Spot the understated yet elegant details, like plaster paint on the ceiling to create a cloud-like effect, and European-inspired doorways wrapped in quartz. Take in the beautiful sightlines from front to back, achieved through a mix of modern and original windows and doors. In the powder room, floor-to-ceiling Zellige tile adds an unexpected touch of drama. <br /><br /><br />MORE DESIGN INSPIRATION<br />• Subscribe to H&amp;H's YouTube Channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/IZae51">https://goo.gl/IZae51</a><br />• Beautiful photo galleries <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://houseandhome.com/galleries/">https://houseandhome.com/galleries/</a><br /><br />----------<br /><br />CONNECT WITH HOUSE &amp; HOME!<br />• Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/houseandhomemagazine/">https://facebook.com/houseandhomemagazine/</a><br />• Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/houseandhomemag/">https://instagram.com/houseandhomemag/</a><br />• Pinterest <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pinterest.com/houseandhome/">https://pinterest.com/houseandhome/</a><br />• Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/HouseandHome">https://twitter.com/HouseandHome</a>{% endraw %}
