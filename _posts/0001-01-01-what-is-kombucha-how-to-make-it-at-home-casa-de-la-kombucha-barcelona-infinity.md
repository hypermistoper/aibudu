{% raw %}Kombucha has become my go-to drink in the recent past and now there's no looking back. It's essentially a fermented tea, a healthy drink that helps detoxify your body and also helps to keep the blood sugar level even so you don't have any spikes or dips in your blood sugar. <br /><br />I've been looking for good Kombuchas throughout Barcelona and now the search has ended -<br />Casa de la Kombucha. <br />They have incredible flavour combinations and Kendra, the co-founder is knowledgable, incredibly passionate and super helpful. <br /><br />If you visit Barcelona or you live here and are looking for a great place to stock up on Kombuchas, head straight to Casa de la Kombucha. <br />You can thank me later ;)<br /><br />Here's how you make Kombucha at home....<br />Ingredients :<br />Filtered water - 1L <br />Black Tea - 5g<br />Scoby <br />Kombucha Starter 250g<br />Flavorings + Fruit Juice + Purée 200g (for 800ml of Kombucha) <br /><br /><br />Directions : <br />- Heat filtered water up to 82c and infuse black tea for atleast 6 minutes. <br />- Add sugar while its warm and leave to cool until it gets to 30c <br />- Add the starter (already made kombucha) and Scoby to the container. (Take both the scoby and kombucha starter from someone you trust)<br />- Cover with a breathable cloth and rubber band. Leave in a dark place undisturbed for 2 weeks. (If you live in a cold place, it might take a bit longer)<br />- After 2 weeks, remove 1/4th starter and scoby and use it for the next batch <br />- In the remaining liquid, add your choice of flavorings like fruits, teas, juices, purées into a spring top bottle and leave for second fermentation for 3-7 days<br />- Before opening the bottle, keep in the fridge until it gets cold and open carefully over the sink. <br />- Pour in a glass and enjoy<br /><br />Casa de la Kombucha - <br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/casadelakombucha/">https://www.instagram.com/casadelakombucha/</a><br />Website - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.casadelakombucha.es/en/">https://www.casadelakombucha.es/en/</a><br />Address: Carrer de Tamarit, 117, 08015 Barcelona<br />Phone: 600 87 31 39<br /><br />Have a lovely day and see you next week :) <br /><br />Subscribe to Infinity Platter Now! : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/InfinityPlatter">http://bit.ly/InfinityPlatter</a><br />________________________________<br />Follow Infinity Platter on other social media platforms: <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/InfinityPlatter">https://www.facebook.com/InfinityPlatter</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/infinityplatter">https://www.instagram.com/infinityplatter</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/allan.rice.lifeandfood">https://www.instagram.com/allan.rice.lifeandfood</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/infinityplatter">https://twitter.com/infinityplatter</a><br /> ________________________________<br />#InfinityPlatter #AashrithaDaggubati #KombuchaBarcelona{% endraw %}
