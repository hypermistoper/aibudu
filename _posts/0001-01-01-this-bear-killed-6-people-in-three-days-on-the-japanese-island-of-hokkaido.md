{% raw %}On the Japanese Island of Hokkaido, there is a very large subspecies of brown bear called the Ussuri brown bear, or Ursus arctos lasiotus, also known as the Amur bear. This bear is very large, comparable to every other brown bear species. But, this particular subspecies of brown bear is renowned for its aggressiveness and hostility toward human beings. <br />The problems started arising on the Ikeda’s family farm in early winter of 1915. The family horse was panicked by a disturbance in the barn and the family patriarch rushed out to witness a large bear fleeing his barn having raided the family cache of corn. This area was still very primitive and animal incursions were not unheard of. <br />A few days later the big bear reappeared. Being concerned for the horse, Mr. Ikeda rounded up some volunteers and decided to chase the bear away for good. The men positioned themselves for a kill shot and fired shots striking the bear. The bear fled and the men went to bed for the night to allow the bear to die. <br />In the morning, they resumed tracking the bear and followed the blood trail for sometime before a snowstorm set in. The bear was headed toward a nearby mountain and the men assumed that that would be the last they heard from him, since they had given him plenty of reason to avoid further contact with humans. <br />On December 9th of the same year, the Ota family was enjoying basic farm chores around mid morning. The family matriarch, Abe Mayu, was watching an infant named Mikio. They were enjoying the warmth of the fire when the injured and hungry brown bear knocked down the door and growled and pawed at them. The bear backed Mayu across the room and reached into her arms and bit the head of the baby killing her instantly. <br />Mayu fought with all of her might, throwing firewood, and just about anything else she could get her hands on, at the beast. She was obviously no match for the giant brown bear as it simply knocked her down and tore her to pieces in her own home. Mayu was dragged from the house into the nearby forest. It was reported that the floor of the home was covered in her blood.<br />A 30 man search party was organized on the following day. They had no sooner entered the forest before running into the brown bear. The bear was clearly guarding a food cache from them. Five of the volunteers fired at the giant before the bear could be driven from the scene. The men found Mayu’s remains. All that was left of her was her head and portions of her lower body. The bear had consumed the rest of her corpse overnight. <br />Amongst the villagers the obvious concern was that the bear would now think of people as a food source. They mustered a hunting party of 50 farmers to rid their village of this bear once and for all. The rallying point was the Ota farmhouse. <br />The bear appeared, as expected, at around 8 PM but the hunting party was in such disarray that only a single shot was fired before the bear escaped. The party immediately left the neighboring Miyouke homestead and started following the bear tracks downstream in the dark of night. <br />The Miyouke matriarch, Yayo, was preparing a meal while the village men were chasing the bear. She held her son, Umekichi, in her arms while she worked. Yayo was startled by a noise outside and before she could check it out, the giant bear crashed through a window and into her house. As chaos ensued in the home, the contents of the meal she was preparing spilled onto the fire extinguishing it, and the oil lamp for lighting was put out as well. The house was dark and Yayo’s sons were seeking her protection. She tripped over them in confusion. The bear immediately began biting and clawing Yayo and her son. <br />Odo was the only man who was left at the Miyouke home to protect them. Odo burst into the room and the bear immediately redirected its rage at him. This allowed Yayo and her sons to beat a hasty escape. Odo hid behind furniture but the bear raked him with its claws. Others in the house were not so lucky. The Saito family was seeking shelter with Yayo and her children. The bear killed the fourth Saito boy and bit his older brother. During this frenzied attack the bear also mauled and killed the 3rd oldest son of the Miyouke clan, Kinzo. The Saito family matriarch, Take was with child. She begged the bear to kill her but leave her baby unharmed. The bear killed and ate parts of her but left her baby, which was later pulled from her womb alive, but died shortly after. <br /> <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/08/03/the-sankebetsu-brown-bear-incident-of-1915-was-the-worst-bear-attack-in-japanese-history/">https://www.thevintagenews.com/2017/08/03/the-sankebetsu-brown-bear-incident-of-1915-was-the-worst-bear-attack-in-japanese-history/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.history.com/news/deadliest-bear-attacks-grizzly">https://www.history.com/news/deadliest-bear-attacks-grizzly</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankebetsu_brown_bear_incident">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sankebetsu_brown_bear_incident</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://darktales.blog/2019/09/09/the-sankebetsu-brown-bear-incident/">https://darktales.blog/2019/09/09/the-sankebetsu-brown-bear-incident/</a><br /><br />Music: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bensound.com">https://www.bensound.com</a>{% endraw %}
