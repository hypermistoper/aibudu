{% raw %}Here is my parody of Let it Go from Frozen, with words and video mash up by me and brilliant singing by the lovely Sarah Brown.<br /><br />This song is about farts! I am feeling hungry tonight, got a hankering for greens. I've had my peas and brussels sprouts; and my favourite, I've had beans!<br /><br />See the live version here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9mCEjRpw_Is">https://youtu.be/9mCEjRpw_Is</a> (for now anyway){% endraw %}
