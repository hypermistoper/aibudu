{% raw %}This video will show you How to Extend a Concrete slab, outlining all of the lessons learned along the way. Sometimes your projects are successful and other times you LEARN. I made so many mistakes during this project, and I learned a lot for next time. Hopefully, this video will help you to avoid some of the pitfalls I fell into while attempting to extend my own concrete slab. <br /><br />For more detailed information on extending a concrete patio, Check out my blog post: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://atimprovements.com/concrete-slab-extensions-diy-guide/">https://atimprovements.com/concrete-slab-extensions-diy-guide/</a><br /><br />Project Summary:<br />Last Summer, I took on the project of extending the concrete slab in my backyard. The slab was in complete disrepair and I wanted to restore and extend the slab so that my deck could bear on it. The steps we took to complete this project are listed below: <br /><br />1. We excavated the additional length for the slab. We dug down approximately 8-10 inches - allowing ~4 inches for the stone sub-base and 4-6 inches for the concrete slab. <br />2. We cleaned the existing slab and used a bonding agent to bond the new 2&quot; concrete &quot;topper&quot; layer to the existing slab. <br />3.  We embedded rebar into the existing slab to strengthen the joint between the existing slab and the new slab. We also used wire mesh to reinforce the new slab. <br />4. We finished the concrete using a hand trowel. <br />5. We applied a concrete topper layer to improve the surface of the Concrete Slab. <br /><br />Overall, here are (what I believe) the main lessons learned. <br />1. This was a big project and my inexperience hurt the project big time. I should have consulted a professional before starting on this project. <br />2. I should have demolished the existing slab and started from scratch. <br />3. I should have used Crusher Run sub-base instead of 57 stone. <br />4. I should have purchased or rented the required tools (bull float, etc.)<br />5. I probably should had the concrete delivered by truck, but it cost a minimum of $1,200 - which would have tripled the project cost. <br />6. I should have put a control joint in the slab. So far, however, no cracks. <br /><br />Please let me know what else I did wrong, because I am sure that I made more mistakes than I even realize.<br /><br />This is episode 2 in my “Backyard Transformation Series”!
