{% raw %}This video is the first in a series describing some loans that are known in the industry as Non-QM.  This means they do not fall under the Dodd-Frank definitions of a Qualifying Mortgage where certain debt to income ratios must be met and income must be documented a certain way.  This first video describes what is known as a Debt Service Cover Ratio loan.  Commercial properties are evaluated similarly.  These properties cannot be owner-occupied, which means there must be an expectation for rental income.  The appraiser determines the rental income who completes 2 additional forms (for an additional fee).  Form 1007 and Form 216 determine first, what the comparable rental income would be from the property, and second, what the operating expenses would be based on the age and condition of the home.  Some programs allow a debt service ratio of 1 to 1!  This means that if the mortgage payment on the new home would be $1,500/month and the comparable rents are at least equal to that, or $1,500/month - the bank will approve the loan!<br /><br />The borrower does not have to provide any income or employment documentation, but they have to have better than average credit and a 20% down payment.  In this case, we ARE verifying income, but it is income from the property and not the borrower.  There will be more to come in this series so stay tuned.{% endraw %}
