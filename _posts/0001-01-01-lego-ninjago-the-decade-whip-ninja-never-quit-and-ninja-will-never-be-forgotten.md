{% raw %}Ninja never quit and Ninja will never be forgotten.<br /><br />As we start this year, we wanted to pay tribute to this amazing video from Spinjitzu Master Falcon, who continues to put such passion into his video for the Fold/Ninjago Community. Here's a note from him:<br /><br />&quot;I just wanted to say thank you guys for all the support you've given me throughout 2021. I know I haven't done many stop motion videos this year as much as I would have liked, but Tournament of Despair should be out by next year. It's just taking a really long time to animate, but I want it to be amazing for you guys. But don't worry, more animations and music videos will be coming out next year, so stay tuned. I chose to use The Wicked Whip as the song choice because I wanted to capture Ninjago at its core. From dragons to snakes, from mechs to martial arts. Everything that makes Ninjago what it is. Essentially, I wanted to show the insanity that is Ninjago. With that being said, Go, Ninja, GO! And a Happy New Year.

Celebrating 122 Million views, The Fold are responsible for the massively popular LEGO Ninjago theme song &quot;The Weekend Whip&quot; and at the height of their game in 2021! Starting out on Tooth &amp; Nail Records, the group spun a failed 2009 album tour into a comical commentary on the current state of the music business with it‚Äôs viral smash hit ‚ÄúEvery Band in the USA.‚Äù (YouTube). From then on, the band decided to just be REAL w their fans. Now surpassing 150,000 subscribers, they are very in tune with their niche fanbase, many of which discovered the band through their Lego Ninjago' hit entitled &quot;The Weekend Whip&quot;, and working to help them discover the bounty of music The Fold has built since starting out in 2006. They continue to leverage their unique brand of heart-forward pop music on their upcoming full-length album already hitting the digital platforms with their first single &quot;Young &amp; Free&quot; (December 2020).<br /><br />MORE FOLD VIDEOS<br />Morro Strikes | Ghost Whip! ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/35mhaAf">https://bit.ly/35mhaAf</a><br />Shintaro Dungeon Whip | Cole's Lament ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2XsP1mZ">https://bit.ly/2XsP1mZ</a><br />Shintaro Dungeon Whip | Cole's Victory ‚ñ∫‚ñ∫‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/39iKbhw">https://bit.ly/39iKbhw</a><br />Christmas Whip | Official Music Video ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/38ytRdD">https://bit.ly/38ytRdD</a><br />21st Century Ninja | Official Music Video ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3nv0ayj">https://bit.ly/3nv0ayj</a><br /><br />Credits:<br />@Spinjitzu Master Falcon <br />Thanks guys, couldn't do it without you! üôèüèª<br /><br />#TheFold #TheFoldMusic #Ninjago‚Äã‚Äã #DecadeOfSpinjitzu‚Äã #LegoNinjago #WeeklyWhip #WeekendWhip #LEGO{% endraw %}
