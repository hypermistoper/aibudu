{% raw %}Today we venture to a place in Pattaya I've never been before, in search of a free stage show.  We check-in to a local hotel and try some local food before setting out in BoyzTown for the evening and taking in a spectacular show with top notch performers, making this a must see while in Pattaya.<br /><br />#Pattaya #Thailand #Rides4Kickz #PattayaThailand{% endraw %}
