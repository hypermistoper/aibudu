{% raw %}Pompeii was destroyed by a volcano in 79 AD, but has much to tell us today. Who is Our Lady of China and why do we need to know?

Chris Alar answers these questions and more.  <br /><br />Support Our Ministries: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thedivinemercy.org/donation">https://www.thedivinemercy.org/donation</a><br /><br />To access our weekly podcast, go to your preferred podcasting platform and search: Explaining the Faith<br />or visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thedivinemercy.org/podcasts">https://www.thedivinemercy.org/podcasts</a>{% endraw %}
