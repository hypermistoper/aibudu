{% raw %}I got a hold of some of the most intelligent minds in the game to put together a training regimen for me to use throughout the week. The results and effectiveness of it were far better than I could have expected. Every single day, I showed up and played to the best of my ability.<br /><br />My Links<br />‣ Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/32Yp5zb">https://discord.gg/32Yp5zb</a><br />‣ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/WaytonPilkin">https://twitter.com/WaytonPilkin</a><br />‣ Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/wayton">https://www.twitch.tv/wayton</a><br />‣ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/waytonpilkin">https://www.instagram.com/waytonpilkin</a><br />‣ TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@waytonpilkin">https://www.tiktok.com/@waytonpilkin</a><br /><br />Gregan: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Gregan_Mike">https://www.youtube.com/c/Gregan_Mike</a><br />FlowState: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/FlowStateGG">https://www.youtube.com/c/FlowStateGG</a><br />Shock: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ShockRL">https://www.youtube.com/c/ShockRL</a><br /><br />Rocket League pros are far better than you can imagine. The skill gap between a pro player and a top 1% player like myself is ginormous. This week, I tried out a professional level training regimen to help me perform to the best of my ability every single day. It was a total success. I was shocked by how much of a difference a solid daily warmup routine can make in your gameplay. Everything you do from the moment you wake up plays into your performance way more than you'd think.<br /><br />Production music from Epidemicsound.com<br /><br />Use Creator Code: WAYTON<br />Thanks to Epic Games and Psyonix for the creator code.<br /><br />:){% endraw %}
