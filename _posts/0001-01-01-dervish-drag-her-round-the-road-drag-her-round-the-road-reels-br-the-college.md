{% raw %}DRAG HER ROUND THE ROAD (REELS)<br />The College Groves: This tune is closely associated with accordion player, Joe Burke. It's also known as The New Demense.<br />Launching the Boat: This tune Shane Mitchell picked up from fiddler Martin McGinley.<br />The Milliner's Daughter: This very old tune is linked with the playing of another legendary box player, the late Joe Cooley.<br />Drag Her Round the Road: A fierce name for a piece of music! We wondered if this tune was also written by the composer of another strongly-titled tune we played - I Buried My Wife and Danced On Top of Her!{% endraw %}
