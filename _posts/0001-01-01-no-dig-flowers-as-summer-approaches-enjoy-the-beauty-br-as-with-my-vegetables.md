{% raw %}Enjoy the beauty!<br />As with my vegetables, I grow flowers using the no dig method of no soil disturbance, and a 2cm dressing of compost on top, less than an inch. The compost is anything decomposed and could even be animal manure, or leaf mould, or homemade compost or compost you buy. <br /><br />The flowers I'm showing you are Escholzia or Californian poppy, Phacelia tanacetifolia or phacelia, annual poppy, red Antirrhinum majus or snapdragon from Bingenheim Seeds, Palaver orientale or Oriental poppy which is 5-6 years old and I don't remember it's name, and Tagetes spatula or dwarf French marigold in the tunnel, from home saved seeds.<br /><br />Read more about no dig in any of my books and on my website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://charlesdowding.co.uk">https://charlesdowding.co.uk</a><br /><br />We published a video about June flowers at Homeacres in 2019 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f00IZ547PxE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f00IZ547PxE</a><br />And about flowers with the vegetables in 2017 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFT4O51DuQY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFT4O51DuQY</a><br /><br />Filmed by Nicola Smith 30th May 2022.<br />Homeacres is a maritime temperate climate, zone 8 but cool summers.{% endraw %}
