WHAT’S WITH YOUR ACCENT?<br />We're Dom &amp; Marie, a French Canadian couple who love Nutella toast and live in a van. Marie is the brain (Ph.D student) and Dom's the dreamer (Creative director). We have spent the last 2 years travelling around North America in our Promaster 136'' named Vanessa. In 2020, after a 12-month trip that was cut short because of Covid, we decided to sell our van to start a new project: a BIGGER van.<br /><br />Our goal is to inspire others to start #vanlife​​ and to help build their very own home on wheels while living and enjoying a balanced online and offline life.{% endraw %}
