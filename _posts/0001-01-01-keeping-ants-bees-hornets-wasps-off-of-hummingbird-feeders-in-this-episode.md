{% raw %}In this episode I show you how to repel insects from the hummingbird feeders.<br />There is nothing more annoying than to see your feeders inundated with everything trying to get at the sugar water except for the hummingbirds for which you placed it.<br />While hummingbirds are bigger than bees, hornets and wasps, one sting and the hummer is certainly issued a death certificate, so they (hummingbirds) will give the stinging insect a wide birth.<br /><br />To find out where I buy things visit our Website<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://CougarRidgeRanch.com/where-to-buy-it/">https://CougarRidgeRanch.com/where-to-buy-it/</a><br /><br />At Cougar Ridge Ranch we have a LOT of hummingbirds from May to September.<br />When I say a LOT, I mean in the neighborhood of 200-500 at any given moment. <br />Experts have come to watch and count and they have estimated up to a few thousand during the peak season<br /><br />It's really hard to tell as they are always coming and going. We've watched males perching in the same place in a tree and they visit the feeder to feed about every 4-12 minutes depending on their energy expenditures. When not disturbed, every station of every feeder is always maxed out busy.<br />The area that the ranch is located is the summer nesting grounds for 4 types of hummingbirds.<br />Rufus, Broad-tail, Black Chinned and Calliope<br />At the last of the video notice the two 1.5 gallon jugs.<br />These and three more are used every other day to fill the feeders.<br />In 2019 we used 20 - 25lb bags of sugar just feeding the hummingbirds. If you do the math, that is 500 pounds of sugar.<br />We feed 4-5 gallons of nectar every two days from Mid July thru the first quarter of August when the large groups just vanish leaving 5-10 stragglers, usually females with young still not ready to follow the migration to Mexico<br />Brad's favorite hummingbird feeders are the largest made by DrJBs.com. They have very wide mouths for each filling, come apart very nicely for cleaning and hold a lot of nectar.<br />We have eight(8) of them and each hold 1/2 gallon of nectar.<br />We also have 14 other feeders that are smaller, from just under 1/2 gallon down to 1 quart each.<br />The males show up late April, the females show up mid May and we see babies about the first week in June.<br />From June through August the numbers grow daily. In the house behind the feeders it sounds like a beehive all day from sun up to sun down.<br />We have feeders with 4, 6, 8, and 10 feeding stations and in the evening just before sunset, and in the morning just before sun up, every station on every feeder is full and with another bird perched or flying waiting, many times Un-Patiently for its drink.<br /><br />To repel insects from the hummingbird feeders simply wipe Tee Tree Oil on each feeding station. The bees, hornets and wasps don't like it at all and will crawl all around it but will not try to drink from a station with it.<br /><br />Ants are not repelled so easily so we spray the top of each feeder with Permethrin<br />As the ants crawl down onto the feeder they come in contact with the Permethrin and will die within seconds.<br /><br />Watch my other videos on Permethrin<br />MY 5 FAVORITE INSECT KILLERS<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/9X6vEdQt3qc">https://youtu.be/9X6vEdQt3qc</a><br />KILL ANY INSECT THAT TOUCHES THIS<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/pVndhssiYlk">https://youtu.be/pVndhssiYlk</a><br />KILLING AIRBORNE PESTS<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/e-_Bi7dJQcU">https://youtu.be/e-_Bi7dJQcU</a><br />CLOTHING TO DIE FOR, KILLING INSECTS ON CONTACT plus<br />Turn your camping gear into instant insect killers too.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/4yEohIIe8zY">https://youtu.be/4yEohIIe8zY</a><br /><br />If you have a serious ant problem see our other video &quot;No More Hornets, Wasps or Ants&quot; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/6wElK5Jbr18">https://youtu.be/6wElK5Jbr18</a> and Brad will teach you how to get rid of their entire colony in 10-14 days.<br /><br />Permethrin is a natural insecticide that comes from the Painted Daisy flower.<br />It comes in a water soluble oil concentrate and in aerosol spray commonly called Dairy Aerosol.<br />It is deadly to any insect that touches it, it can kill for up to 30 days.<br />It is safe to use around all food and is NON-Toxic to mammals or birds, it IS also Toxic to fish.<br />It is the ONLY approved &quot;pesticide&quot; for use in dairy milking parlors and bakery's with open food in California.<br /><br />Subscribe to my channel here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CougarRidgeRanch?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/c/CougarRidgeRanch?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />My Social Links: <br />facebook.com/CougarRidgeRanch <br />facebook.com/BradWardle <br />twitter.com/BWardleCW<br />instagram.com/CaptainWingnut <br /><br />As Always:<br />This is what &quot;I do&quot;, it's up to you to ALWAYS use your own research &amp; more importantly...common sense.<br />I welcome  your comments &amp; questions and I do my best to answer as many as I physically can<br />If you decide to post a comment, be nice &amp; post an educated, intelligent comment<br />If YouTube doesn't, I may delete and mute/block any inappropriate, rude, mean, frivolous, un-intelligent (stupid) or irrelevant posts or posters{% endraw %}
