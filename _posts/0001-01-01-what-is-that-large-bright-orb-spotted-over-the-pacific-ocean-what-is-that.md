{% raw %}What is that Large, Bright Orb Spotted over the Pacific Ocean?<br /><br /><br />A mysterious large white light/orb was recorded hovering over the Pacific Ocean not seeming to move for nearly 4 minutes then vanishes into thin air, just disappeared! It was a continuous energy, did not blink.<br /><br />Newport, Oregon / Pacific Ocean.<br /><br />(I noticed on the clock at 3:39 just before the video ended and it vanishes.<br /><br /> I SAW A STREAK IN THE RIGHT HAND SECTION OF THE VIDEO! <br />What was that? Is a comet, meteorite or possibly an asteroid going to hit the ocean on the west coast? God keeps showing me something is coming to the west coast and he has shown other prophetic servants as well!)<br /><br />Video Credits: Permission MrMBB333<br /><br />Thank you for sharing your dreams and visions which helps to confirm something is coming!
