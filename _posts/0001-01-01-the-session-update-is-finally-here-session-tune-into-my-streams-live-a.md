{% raw %}TUNE INTO MY STREAMS LIVE!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitch.tv/garrettginnerlive">http://www.twitch.tv/garrettginnerlive</a><br />ㅤ<br />ㅤ THE SESSION UPDATE IS FINALLY HERE! The Session update that we've all been waiting for is FINALLY HERE! The new update includes a lot of stuff, but the biggest (and most important in my opinion) is the HUGE revamp to the Session replay editor. It pretty much combines the Skater XL replay editor with the Skate 3 replay editor and makes one of the best skateboarding game replay editors I've ever seen. Now don't get me wrong, Session is still a work in progress and it still has a long ways to go, but this is a HUGE step in the right direction.<br /><br /><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.falkinco.com">http://www.falkinco.com</a><br />@garrettginner on all socials<br />Gaming insta: @garrettginnergaming <br /><br />DISCORD:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/V7ZReJX">https://discord.gg/V7ZReJX</a><br /><br />Intro done by (show him some love, he makes dope beats too): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvNY4R4Fwfg_M-giZh10czg?view_as=subscriber">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvNY4R4Fwfg_M-giZh10czg?view_as=subscriber</a><br /><br />Outro song: Picture This - KDG <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/track/7cGZ45DO1qJEbfvYfAYQR8?si=Qqk8rYvbSb2ghcWuaU400A">https://open.spotify.com/track/7cGZ45DO1qJEbfvYfAYQR8?si=Qqk8rYvbSb2ghcWuaU400A</a><br /><br />Oh, you're still reading the description? That's kinda weird. I guess I'll tell you a bit about myself. My name is Garrett Ginner, I like skateboarding, playing video games, and having fun. I have my main channel where I post vlogs and that kinda stuff, and I decided to start this channel because I've always had a love for playing video games. Now, I'm not actually good at any video games, so I spend a lot of my time playing action games like Skater XL, Descenders, Beam NG, Skate 3, etc. but I'm always looking for new games to play. Ok I really don't know what to type here so I'm just gonna stop. Bye now.<br /><br />#garrettginnergaming #gaming #session #skaterxl #sessionupdate #sessionvsskaterxl{% endraw %}
