{% raw %}How much do you *really* understand about how the internet works? <br /><br />If you're calling up your son or daughter, niece or nephew when your tech breaks, then this is the video for you! In this workshop with Nez Technologics, founder Joe-Eillot Nez explains exactly what a router and a modem do, what WiFi is in its basic form, and how you can use Hotspot tethering.  Learn what data speeds and data sizes are and how they play a role in broadband and also discover the pros and cons of the multiple ways we can connect to the internet (DSL, Coax, Cellular, Satellite, and Fiber). Use all of this new knowledge to build your understanding of the current state of broadband on Navajoland and what we can expect on the reservation in regards to internet deployment over the next two years.{% endraw %}
