{% raw %}The geo detective series continues with this corker sent in by Aksel, who along with the rest of his family would love to know where this picture of his grandmother was taken. All we know is that she was holidaying in the united states, and with limited information in the image, I had a feeling this one might be a slog. I wasn't wrong..<br /><br />Big shout out to editor Joe who did a cracking job with this on his debut.{% endraw %}
