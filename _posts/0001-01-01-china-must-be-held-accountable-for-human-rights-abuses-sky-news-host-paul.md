{% raw %}Sky News host Paul Murray says one of the “absolute disgraces” of the 21st century is how China is treating their Uighur population.<br /><br />“They must be held accountable for that behaviour,” Mr Murray said.<br /><br />“Yet the world keeps rewarding China with its business and with events like the Summer and Winter Olympics. <br /><br />“They are a disgrace. Not the people - the government of China is a disgrace.”{% endraw %}
