Here is where you can find them: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Spickles8/status/1473822892215443465">https://twitter.com/Spickles8/status/1473822892215443465</a><br />--<br />Music used:<br />Clock Tower - Marvel Vs Capcom 2<br />Halland Dalarna (minecraft dungeons) - Smash Ultimate<br />Bury the Light - Devil May Cry 5<br />Party in the Clouds - Hey Ice King! Why'd You Steal Our Garbage<br />Among Us Medley by Kibo~panpan<br />Attack of the Killer Queen - Deltarune<br />Jambastion Adventure - Kirby Star Allies<br />Kurikinton FATAL FURY 2 (Remix) - Smash Bros Ultimate<br />Mute City - Mario Kart 8<br />Annoying Dog - Undertale<br />Dance of the Decorous - Crypt of the Necrodancer<br />Flying Battery Act 1 - Sonic Mania<br />Fire Emblem Three Houses Main Theme - Smash Ultimate<br />Interrogation Room - Persona 5<br />–<br />And here it is, the custom stage mode that basically allows you to play on ultra melee turbo mode deluxe<br /><br />It’s super fun, yet very broken for some characters lol; basically all Fire emblem characters with the nair that turns around (chrom, lucina, roy and marth) are broken af and basically instantly banned<br /><br />The moves that are already fast and abusable become 10x more oppressive in this mode, while moves that are slow literally can’t even come out lol; however it does make aerials with fast start up and high endlag more safe at least!! Definitely recommend trying it lol it’s super fun<br /><br />#tcnick3 #smashultimate #smashbrosultimate{% endraw %}
