{% raw %}The typical cataract has a diameter of about 10 mm and that has to come through the capsulorhexis and the pupil during cataract surgery. We break the cataract nucleus into pieces to aid in this, but having a smaller pupil makes the surgery significantly more challenging. If we can achieve about a 5 mm pupil and a 5 mm capsulorhexis, the surgery will be much smoother, safer for the patient, and less stressful for the surgeon. But do you need to spend the $125 (USD) or more for a single-use pupil expansion ring that has its own set of issues? Or must we use iris hooks which require extra incisions into the eye?<br /><br />There is a way: pupil stretching using instruments that you already have on your tray. While there are instruments that are specifically designed for this purpose such as the 2, 3, and 4-prong pupil dilators made by Beehler and Moria, I prefer to simply use two choppers.{% endraw %}
