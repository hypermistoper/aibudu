{% raw %}The guys are back with a special edition of Vibe with FIVE.  This week, we take a look at what went wrong for United at Goodison Park.  We talk the pending appointment of Erik ten Hag as United manager.  We reflect on the epic title race clash between City and Liverpool at the Etihad.  What a game.  The guys discuss if United v Arsenal or City v Liverpool is the greatest rivalry in EPL history.  Following the debate, we have a special guest.  We sit down with Kieran Richardson! We talk his rise as a young player through West Ham, to United, Sunderland with Roy Keane, and how he’s taking over the luxury watch industry!  A jam packed, amazing episode of Vibe with FIVE.<br /><br />0:00; Coming Up…<br />1:26; SOKIN AD<br />2:34; Intro<br />3:49; Everton v Man United<br />8:23; When will United next win the title?<br />23:41; Man City v Liverpool<br />34:03; Who’s winning the league?<br />34:57; Southampton v Chelsea<br />35:41; Aston Villa v Tottenham<br />39:02; Leicester v Crystal Palace<br />39:14; Arsenal v Brighton<br />39:54; Is City &amp; Liverpool a rivalry?<br />42:08; Premier League Results<br />42:30; Fan Questions!<br />46:53; Ballers &amp; Watches<br />49:23; Kieran on his move to Man United<br />57:22; Rio on Kieran’s best abilities<br />1:00:57; Learning on Loan<br />1:03:36; Fake Media Stories<br />1:07:57; Kieran on his England call up<br />1:08:55; Rio &amp; Kieran on United tours<br />1:10:28; Kieran on his move to Sunderland<br />1:19:03; Why Kieran didn’t announce his retirement<br />1:20:48; Ballers &amp; Watches Teaser<br />1:21:40; Kieran on his Clients<br />1:23:31; Wynts Freestyle<br />1:24:05; Outro<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/15QO9WE">http://bit.ly/15QO9WE</a><br /><br />FIVE UK IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/fiveuk">https://www.instagram.com/fiveuk</a><br />FIVE UK TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FIVEUK">https://twitter.com/FIVEUK</a><br /><br />Rio Ferdinand Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/rioferdy5">https://www.instagram.com/rioferdy5</a><br />Rio Ferdinand Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/rioferdy5">https://twitter.com/rioferdy5</a><br /><br />Kieran Richardson - Broad Talks Youtube Channel<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCilSQYZc6vR-y0TiHnZb9Xw/featured">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCilSQYZc6vR-y0TiHnZb9Xw/featured</a><br /><br />Kieran Richardson - Broad Walk Group Instagram <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/broadwalk/">https://www.instagram.com/broadwalk/</a><br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://broadwalkgroup.com/">https://broadwalkgroup.com/</a><br /><br />SPONSORED BY SOKIN <br />OPEN A FREE ACCOUNT AND START YOUR SOKIN JOURNEY TODAY: www.sokin.com<br /><br /><br />Say goodbye to expensive hidden-fees and hefty currency exchange markups and say hello to Sokin, a safe, convenient and easy way to send money abroad.<br /><br /><br />For a no-contract, fixed monthly fee (£9.99/€9.99), you get unlimited money transfers and cost-effective currency exchange in 38 currencies to over 200 countries* via our free, easy-to-use app, wherever you are in the world.<br /><br /><br />From going to the shops, to withdrawing cash from an ATM, our eco-friendly Sokin cards (UK-only) can be used for your day-to-day requirements. Our cards are also accepted worldwide; ideal for all your holiday payment needs.<br /><br /><br />So, what are you waiting for? Download the Sokin app and register for your FREE global currency account to enjoy unlimited, commission-free, hassle-free global payments!  Available on iOS and Android.<br /><br />#RioFerdinand #FIVE{% endraw %}
