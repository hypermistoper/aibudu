{% raw %}Some narcissistic people want you to leave and they push you away on purpose. Some narcissistic people are cowardly and want actually leave you alone, but they will treat you badly enough that pretty much forces you to be the one that discards them. <br />Welcome my channel! If this is your first time seeing my face or hearing my voice, my name is Lee and I am a self aware narcissist. I have narcissistic personality disorder  ( NPD ) and I've been in therapy for my personality disorder since 2017 and it has definitely changed my life because without it, I would have lost everything. <br /><br />The point of these videos is to help bring awareness from the other side of the narcissistic *buse spectrum. All my videos give perspective on why many narcissists do what they do and the possible different reasons behind them. The victims and survivors get validation and the Narcissists (those that are willing) get to see that you can get help and that you are not alone. <br /><br />1 on 1's and all my links - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://beacons.page/mentalhealness">https://beacons.page/mentalhealness</a> <br /><br />You can find me on -<br /><br />Tiktok MentalHealness - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@mentalhealness?lang=en">https://www.tiktok.com/@mentalhealness?lang=en</a><br /><br />Insta- Mentalhealnesss - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mentalhealnesss/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/mentalhealnesss/?hl=en</a><br /><br />Facebook - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/MentalHealness85">https://www.facebook.com/MentalHealness85</a><br /><br />Click the BEACON up top for direct links.
