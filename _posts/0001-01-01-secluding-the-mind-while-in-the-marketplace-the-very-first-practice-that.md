{% raw %}The very first practice that everyone who takes up meditation is the &quot;seclusion of the mind&quot;. You must retreat from the &quot;noise&quot; of daily life, sit down in a quiet space, and begin to be mindful of your inner experiences.  Once your mindfulness is established through seclusion in a quite place, then you will need to learn how to create that same &quot;seclusion&quot; while still in the marketplace.<br />Join Miles in his meditation membership program the &quot;Meditation Discovery Cycle&quot;.
