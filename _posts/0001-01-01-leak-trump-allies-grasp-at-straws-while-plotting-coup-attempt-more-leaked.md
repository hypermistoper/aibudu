{% raw %}More leaked texts from Trump allies reveal just how far some Republicans were willing to go to keep Trump in power as Sen. Mike Lee and Rep. Chip Roy reportedly warned Mark Meadows about the consequences of attempting to overthrow the election. Once staunch supporters of the overthrow effort, Lee and Roy seemingly backpedaled as January 6th drew near, with both getting cold feet over how the insurrection attempt would effectively destroy our country‚Äôs government for good. John Iadarola, Francesca Fiorentini, and Farron Cousins discuss on The Young Turks.

Mike Lee of Utah and GOP Rep. Chip Roy of Texas to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. The text exchanges show that both members of Congress initially supported legal challenges to the election but ultimately came to sour on the effort and the tactics deployed by Trump and his team.<br /><br />‚ÄúWe‚Äôre driving a stake in the heart of the federal republic,‚Äù Roy texted Meadows on January 1. That text was first released in December by the House select committee and described as being written by a House Freedom Caucus member. Roy‚Äôs authorship has not been previously reported.<br /><br />When situated in the overall timeline of events between the election and January 6, the series of texts from Lee and Roy provide new details about how two Trump allies went from fierce advocates of the former President‚Äôs push to overturn Joe Biden‚Äôs win to disheartened bystanders. By January 3, Lee was texting Meadows that the effort ‚Äúcould all backfire badly.‚Äù&quot;<br /><br />*** <br /><br />The largest online progressive news show in the world.
