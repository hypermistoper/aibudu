{% raw %}Thanks for Your support and Love. <br />A tire plug is a piece of leather coated with a rubber compound placed into the hole and plugs on the inside of the tire. A patch is a strip of rubber with a sticky back that is placed on the damaged part of the tire to prevent air from escaping.<br /><br />Tire Repair Process<br />Remove tire from the rim.<br />Thorough inspection of both the inside and outside of the tire. ...<br />Once deemed repairable, trim the puncture area of damaged cables to clean and stabilize the area.<br />From the inside out, pull a rubber stem through the puncture area sealing off the inside of the tire.<br /><br />Patches are better than plugs for bigger holes, holes closer to but not the sidewall and holes that aren't completely straight. Note that if you're looking to do tire sidewall repair, a patch will usually not cut it and you'll likely want to replace the tire. Don't patch the tire if it's near the sidewall.<br /><br />Amazing Technique of Repairing Hard Impact Sidewall Truck Tire | How to Vulcanize Truck Tire<br /><br />If the tire has two punctures, getting a tire repaired may still be an option as long as the punctures are at least 16 inches apart and the maximum number of repairs does not exceed a total of 2 in the tire. Any more punctures than that, and you should consider getting a new tire.<br /><br />As long as you notice the puncture or leak in time and don't continue to drive on a flat, then the patched tire will function as well as your other tires on the road.<br /><br />The most common vulcanizing method is to treat natural rubber with sulfur, which causes a chemical reaction that softens the touching materials (such as a patch and a tire) and binds them together, increasing the rubber's rigidity and durability.<br />To treat (rubber) with sulfur and heat, thereby imparting strength, greater elasticity, durability, etc. to subject (a substance other than rubber) to some analogous process, as to harden it.<br /><br />#PakistaniTrucks{% endraw %}
