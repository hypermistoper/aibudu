{% raw %}The Futurama episode The Prisoner of Benda features a machine that allows two people to switch minds. The problem is that two bodies can only switch minds once.  Fry and Co. goes wild on the mind switching machine and have to resort to some serious math to get back into their own bodies. Our mission in this video is to give a crystal clear explanation of the Futurama theorem. <br /><br />As an added bonus there is also some Stargate mind switching action towards the end of the video.<br /><br />(added 15 August 2015) We just posted a follow up video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/w0mxdo5ur_A">https://youtu.be/w0mxdo5ur_A</a><br /><br />Enjoy :){% endraw %}
