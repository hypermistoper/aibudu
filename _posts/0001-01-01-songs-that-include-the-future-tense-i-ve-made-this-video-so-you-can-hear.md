{% raw %}I've made this video so you can hear the future tense in songs. <br />It's very handy to learn the different future tenses.<br />But I don't own the videos of the videoclip.<br /><br />The songs I've used are:<br />- I will always love you <br />- Live my life<br />- I won't give up<br />- Next to me<br />- Coming home<br />- Train leaves here this morning<br />- Santa Claus is coming to town<br /><br />Enjoy!{% endraw %}
