{% raw %}Watch the brand new #trailer for #NextDoor starring Daniel Brühl. Exclusively on Curzon Home Cinema Friday 01 Oct.<br /><br />Brühl plays Daniel, a popular actor. He’s getting ready to fly off for a casting call on a superhero movie (Brühl is a Marvel regular) but opts to have a final few drinks in his local bar. It’s a mistake, as he soon finds himself in a confrontation with Bruno (Peter Kurth), a local who is in the mood to dampen Daniel’s day. At first, Daniel attempts to throw Bruno with his charm. But when he sees the middle-aged, former East German is having none of it, Daniel’s patience begins to wear thin.{% endraw %}
