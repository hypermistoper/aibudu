{% raw %}Cutefish is an upcoming desktop environment that's going to be radically different from anything you've experienced till now. Stunning looks, modern design, and intuitiveness that's basically instinct, drive the development of this new and premium interface.<br />Â <br />I've installed the beta version of Cutefish and the way it feels to use this interface has left me very impressed. The idea behind this project is to provide a high-quality interface for Linux newcomers, that is easy to navigate, equipped with all the tools needed for everyday usage but leaves out the complex things which might overwhelm the users. Simplicity is the prime driver here. And I believe Cutefish is going to be noteworthy when it ultimately rolls out the stable release.<br /><br />Support Me on Patreon:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/linuxtex">https://www.patreon.com/linuxtex</a><br /><br />Connect With Me on Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/aquilroshan/">https://www.instagram.com/aquilroshan/</a><br /><br />Download CutefishOS:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.cutefishos.com/">https://en.cutefishos.com/</a><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />0:00 Intro<br />0:55 User Interface<br />3:21 Cloudfish Apps<br />5:00 Performance<br />6:24 Installation<br />7:44 Conclusion{% endraw %}
