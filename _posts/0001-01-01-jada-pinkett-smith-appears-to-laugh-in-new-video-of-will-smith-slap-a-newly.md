{% raw %}A newly surfaced video seemingly shows Jada Pinkett Smith laughing after her husband Will Smith smacked Chris Rock during the 2022 Oscars over a joke about her hair. In the clip, which was filmed by an audience member sitting behind her and later shared on TikTok, shows Jada, who has been open about her alopecia diagnosis, bending over in a motion that suggests she was laughing as Will returned to his seat following the slap. NBC News has reached out to the Smiths for comment.{% endraw %}
