{% raw %}The story behind the Gold medals and World Records: Nils van der Poel &quot;came out of nowhere&quot; to dominate speed skating's 5000m and 10000m during the 20-21 and 21-22 seasons.  Like most &quot;out of nowhere&quot;  stories, the real path to ultimate success was much longer and far windier.  Here I talk with both Nils and his 3-time Olympian coach Johan RÃ¶jler about wanting to be a great athlete already at age 8, the costs of that ambition, and how coach and athlete carved out a demanding but sustainable balance in both his training and his life to rewrite the record books in these events, and reinvigorate the conversation about endurance training best practice.{% endraw %}
