{% raw %}&quot;But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him.&quot; -Hebrews 11:6<br /><br />How in heck did I end up with a foreign car? Trust me when I say I'm beyond excited to feature some lovely JDM, even though this one is down on its luck tremendously. Think it'll run after being neglected for 15 years?<br /><br />MERCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dylanmccool.bigcartel.com">https://dylanmccool.bigcartel.com</a><br />Instagram: @dylanmccool<br /><br />Junkyard Digs: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS87-wYrvmexsLkBj0jhrnQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCS87-wYrvmexsLkBj0jhrnQ</a><br /><br />Send me something!<br />Dylan McCool<br />PO Box 398<br />Hazel Green, AL 35750<br /><br />SHARE YOUR PROJECT:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/593980851453429/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/593980851453429/</a><br /><br />Like my Facebook page! www.facebook.com/dylanmccool1970<br /><br />#mccoolauto #abandoned #datsun{% endraw %}
