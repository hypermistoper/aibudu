{% raw %}Learning how a fairy does ART üßö‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è<br /><br />LET'S BE FRIENDS -- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ">https://goo.gl/a7ctjJ</a><br /><br />HEY EVERYBODY!! My marker flowers are growing, I have been waiting for this time for so long! Marker flowers only grow on Fairy Island during a certain time of year.. I am so excited! While I was picking all my favorite colors of markers, the Pirate Dad saw me from the top of his ship and thought I was trying to steal his treasure! I asked him if he wanted to come down and help me do fairy art! At first he thought I was tricking, like I set up a trap! When he came down from his ship we both picked markers together and I told him about a SUPER SECRET part of the island that only fairies know about... &quot;Creative Cave&quot;. Me and my fairy friends found the cave a long time ago, it's hidden inside the lava volcano on Pirate Island! If you push a lava button on the side there is a secret door that let's you into the cave. So today we are gonna do art! It's a Fairy Adley and Pirate Dad art day! We made lots of fun crafts like Treasure Maps, Animals, and even decorated the stink pirate's treasure chest! <br /><br /> my last video: ADLEY SURPRiSES for YOU ‚ù§Ô∏è Valentines Delivery from Mailman dad! my morning routine and heart merch<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qOJhp01rfc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qOJhp01rfc</a><br /><br />my dad's last video: Living at PiRATE iSLAND with ADLEY!!
