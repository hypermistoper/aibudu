{% raw %}In Spain we do have turkey for Christmas as well. In my family we prepare it in this really different and very special way and of all the turkeys I have tried in my life I can assure you this is the best by far! We Botox de turkey with brandy and we massage the turkey after some yoga exercises. When I say that something is the best and special is for a reason. Be prepared for a very unique Christmas turkey recipe with all the trimmings.<br /><br />If you have enjoyed the video please give me a thumbs up and subscribe to the channel, I will be posting more and more recipes every week, and let me know in the comments box below your opinions, any doubts you may have or which other recipes would you like me to cook. <br /><br />If you live in the UK you can order my favorite artisan Spanish Ingredients which I use on the videos from my ONLINE DELI <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thespanishchef.com/shop">https://www.thespanishchef.com/shop</a>  at the best prices and get them delivered to your door.<br /><br />If you want the full recipe go to my website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thespanishchef.com/recipes">https://www.thespanishchef.com/recipes</a> <br /><br />Alternatively, you can find this recipe and many others in my 2 bestselling books: <br /><br />TAPAS REVOLUTION <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0091951259/ref=cm_sw_r_wa_api_fabc_401RN9CBQZKSTYW4XJTB">https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0091951259/ref=cm_sw_r_wa_api_fabc_401RN9CBQZKSTYW4XJTB</a><br /><br />SPANISH MADE SIMPLE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1787137201/ref=cm_sw_r_wa_api_fabc_0KK9YKQ0XYGE8G4JQ8F5">https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1787137201/ref=cm_sw_r_wa_api_fabc_0KK9YKQ0XYGE8G4JQ8F5</a><br /><br />If you would like to try my food in the flesh I would be delighted to welcome you to any of my TAPAS REVOLUTION restaurants across the UK, please check out our locations and don’t forget to make a reservation <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tapasrevolution.com/find-us">https://www.tapasrevolution.com/find-us</a><br /><br /><br />To FOLLOW ME on social media I leave you a few links below: <br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/omarallibhoy">https://www.instagram.com/omarallibhoy</a> <br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://m.facebook.com/OmarAllibhoyChef/">https://m.facebook.com/OmarAllibhoyChef/</a> <br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/OmarAllibhoy">http://twitter.com/OmarAllibhoy</a> <br /><br />EDITED MY MATHROBINSON<br />@_mathrobinson<br /><br />INTRO MUSIC by UN TÍO GRANDE, check him out!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://m.youtube.com/channel/UC1QS7N">https://m.youtube.com/channel/UC1QS7N</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/untiogrande/">https://www.instagram.com/untiogrande/</a> <br /><br />Gracias amigos, <br /><br />Omar Allibhoy | The Spanish Chef xx{% endraw %}
