{% raw %}In this video I mowed the lawn for the first time this year. this was a lot of fun for me because I never mow on hills and it was a cool change of pace. I am so excited to get back to mowing. I just spend 2 weeks down at my mom and dads house to do crazy power washing and spend a little time with them before my season really starts. While I was there I cleaned right around 20 filthy properties so if you enjoy clean ups and dirty powerwashing please subscribe it really goes along ways to helping the channel out. Thank you so much for spending a little time with me today as I clean the property up.{% endraw %}
