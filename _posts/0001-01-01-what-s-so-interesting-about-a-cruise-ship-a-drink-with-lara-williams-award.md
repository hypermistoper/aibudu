{% raw %}Award winning author Lara Williams chats to Idler editor Tom Hodgkinson about her new novel, 'The Odyssey'.<br /><br />The Odyssey is a wickedly funny takedown of modern capitalism and our anxious, ill-fated quests for something to believe in. And, as its title suggests, it is a voyage that will eventually lead its unlikely heroine all the way home.

Supper Club won the Guardian ‘Not the Booker’ Prize, was named as a Book of the Year 2019 by TIME and Vogue, and has been translated into six languages. Lara Williams lives in Manchester, teaches Creative Writing at the Manchester Writing School and is a contributor to the Guardian, Independent, Times Literary Supplement, Vice, Dazed and others.
