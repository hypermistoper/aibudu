Despite having incredibly uncontroversial content, she's managed to find herself on the political TikTok battlefield every couple of months for the last three years. It began with simple complaints about hate comments, and has since escalated to the point where OnlyJayus cannot even make a simple joke without being cancelled, along the way having beefed with creators like Acrello, AuntKaren0, PapaGut, and TheJonathanMoss. This video will cover that transition, and in the process, explain how OnlyJayus became TikTok's most hated creator.<br /><br />This is, How OnlyJayus Became TikTok’s Most Hated Creator.<br /><br />Thank you guys for watching, like and sub if you enjoyed, SunnyV2 XO ❤<br /><br />This video was heavily inspired by Bills &quot;The Downfall Of OnlyJayus: The Most Hated Content Creator On TikTok!&quot;, big thanks to him, you can watch his version here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2bonyhe0A8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2bonyhe0A8</a>{% endraw %}
