{% raw %}Today we’re going to be talking about the advantages of being an entrepreneur. Let’s face it. Being an entrepreneur is super underrated. It’s one of the most fulfilling things that one can experience. Obviously, at this point, you may be benchmarking, like against pros and cons, and whether to understand if this is something you may want to take on or not. In today’s video, we’re going to provide you with some insights so that you’re able to decide whether or not making that leap of faith makes sense for you.<br /><br />RESOURCES &amp; LINKS: <br />____________________________________________<br /><br />Fundraising training: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://alejandrocremades.com/fundraising-training">https://alejandrocremades.com/fundraising-training</a><br /><br />Pitch deck template: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://alejandrocremades.com/silicon-valley-legend-creates-pitch-deck-template-for-entrepreneurs">https://alejandrocremades.com/silicon-valley-legend-creates-pitch-deck-template-for-entrepreneurs</a><br /><br />Article on the advantages of being an entrepreneur: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://alejandrocremades.com/the-advantages-of-being-an-entrepreneur">https://alejandrocremades.com/the-advantages-of-being-an-entrepreneur</a><br /><br />____________________________________________<br /><br />The first thing is that you are the master of your own destiny. Now, you don’t have a boss; you don’t have a corporation that may decide to fire you the next day. <br /><br />It is also the sanest and safest path. Obviously, being an entrepreneur is not easy. It’s full of ups and downs. It’s a super risky scenario, but also anything that has to do with business is risky as well. As I said earlier, you can be in a job in a corporation, and they can fire you at any point. <br /><br />You live and die with no regrets. I can’t stress enough how one of the biggest questions or the biggest regrets that people have is the “What if?” What if I had done this. What if I had done that. That is one of the biggest regrets when you’re coming to the final days in your life.<br /><br />So, really being an entrepreneur and taking that leap of faith is going to be super fulfilling in that regard where you’re not going to have “What ifs?” You actually saw that idea. You saw that opportunity. You were excited. You were passionate about that specific problem that you wanted to address, to resolve, to bring a solution to market, and there are going to be no regrets when you get to those years because you can surely bet that you lived your life the way that you wanted to live it and that you had no “What ifs?” <br /><br />Being an entrepreneur, you can also make your own decisions and do it better. You can also use data to iterate, to see what’s working, what’s not working. Obviously, those business plans bringing to market; it’s not going to work anymore. <br /><br />You can use a pitch deck, just like the pitch deck template that you can see below, to develop your story, to see what the customers are saying, what potential employees or potential investors so that you continue to iterate. But with data, you’re going to be able to develop that story, that story that you’re going to be using in order to create that possibility, that possibility around the universe that you’re creating of customers, employees, or investors to continue pushing things forward.<br /><br />Then forget about the peer pressure. Here as an entrepreneur, you’re going to have that opportunity to develop the future that you want to see, to put that gap that you’re seeing in the market, in that future that perhaps you’re seeing in front of you because at the end of the day when you become an entrepreneur is because you are seeing a problem that is there in the marketplace, and that you develop a solution to address what is happening in the market.<br /><br />Then also, as an entrepreneur, you have the possibility of building a legacy, creating something that is generating not only great wealth for your business, but also, when you die, you’re remembered. And that is one of the biggest things because being part of this world and putting a dent in it and doing it in a way in which people are going to remember you is super, super powerful.<br /><br />You can also teach your kids to do the same because by your kids looking at you, seeing how you’re executing. I’ve got to tell you that some of the best entrepreneurs that I have interviewed in the DealMakers podcast, where I have interviewed super successful entrepreneurs, their parents were also entrepreneurs. They were able to see the ups, the downs, to see how they embrace the journey and how fulfilling the highs are. So being an entrepreneur, you’re going to be able to teach your kids that they can also create the future that they want to grow into.<br /><br />Also, as an entrepreneur, you have the opportunity to make a difference to others. You can empower other entrepreneurs once you’ve come across, and you’ve really experienced that journey. <br /><br />► If you need help with your fundraising efforts check out our fundraising training @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://alejandrocremades.com/fundraising-training">https://alejandrocremades.com/fundraising-training</a><br /><br />►Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT_SVcatqpxC2vBpyF92imA?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT_SVcatqpxC2vBpyF92imA?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />►Find me on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT_S...">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT_S...</a><br />►On Linkedin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/acremades">https://www.linkedin.com/in/acremades</a>{% endraw %}
