{% raw %}THE HOMEOWNER WANTED ME TO MATCH THEIR PRICE | THAT‚ÄôS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN!<br /><br />We have been in business almost 11 yrs and I would like to say this is the first time a homeowner has asked us to match the competitions price but its definitely not. If you‚Äôre new to this industry you might fall for this. But as your business grows and you deal with more and more homeowners you learn some tricks of the trade. I would suggest to stick to your prices. Just know this runs the risk of losing a customer. We are ok with that and understand as a business the consequences of our actions. THIS IS WHY WE DON'T MATCH PRICES. REAL LIFE EXAMPLE! 9 yrs ago I 3 customers all on the same block with very similar size yards. They were all $40 mows. One customer told me that he got a cheaper estimate and that if I didn't match the $30 estimate I would lose him as a customer. So I lowered the price, I didn't want to lose a customer. well not even 3 days later the other two customers called wanting me to lower their prices now because the other guy told them he got a cheaper rate. I told them no and they weren‚Äôt happy at all but kept me mowing. I immediately called the other customer back and told him his rate was back to $40 and if that wasn‚Äôt ok! he should go with the guy. Well he didn't get mowed for a few weeks but then eventually he found someone else to mow.  That was the day I learned not to lower my prices. It never ends well.<br /><br />Coffee cups and other great SLC gift ideas.üëáüèª<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://slcmerch.myshopify.com/">https://slcmerch.myshopify.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ebay.com/str/teamspencershop">https://www.ebay.com/str/teamspencershop</a><br /><br />üü¢ LMN SOFTWARE LINK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://share.golmn.com/spencersVIP">https://share.golmn.com/spencersVIP</a><br /><br />CODE SPENCER SAVES 10%üëáüèª<br />DARWINS GRIP BALLARD LINK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ballard-inc.com/product/darwins-grip-trimmer-handle/">https://www.ballard-inc.com/product/darwins-grip-trimmer-handle/</a><br /><br />MOWER STRAPS CARGO BUCKLES HERE - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3m3XFEa">https://amzn.to/3m3XFEa</a><br /><br />CODE: SPENCER SAVES YOU üí∞<br />ISOTUNES HEARING PROTECTION: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://isotunes.com/products/isotunes-free-aware">https://isotunes.com/products/isotunes-free-aware</a><br /><br />TRAILER JACK ATTACHMENT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/377ugFi">https://amzn.to/377ugFi</a><br /><br />üì™ WANT TO SEND US MAIL ? <br />SPENCER LAWN CARE <br />P.O.
