{% raw %}Yesterday was the sentencing of Kimberly Potter over the shooting death of Duante Wright. This was the “Taser! Taser! Taser!” shooting in which Potter mistakenly drew her Glock 17 pistol instead of her intended Taser and shot and killed Duante Wright as he violent fought lawful arrest against three officers while attempting to speed off in his car.  A jury misinformed on the relevant law would find Potter guilty of manslaughter as charged.<br /><br /><br /><br />Ultimately, Judge Regina Chu sentenced Potter to an effective 14 months in prison, where she will be kept largely isolation from the general prison population.  Potter was facing a guideline sentence of some 7 years, which could have been greatly extended if Judge Chu had sought to apply the aggravating factors sought by the State prosecutors.<br /><br /><br /><br />The best that can be said for the sentencing is that it moderately mitigates an ongoing travesty of injustice, because Kimberly Potter committed no crime, and ought to have been convicted of nothing whatever.<br /><br />#duantewright #kimpotter #kimberlypotter #tasertasertaser #taser{% endraw %}
