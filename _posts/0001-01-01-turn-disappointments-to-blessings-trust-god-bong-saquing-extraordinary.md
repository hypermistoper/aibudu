{% raw %}God allowed circumstances to work in such a way that Moses can be “homeschooled” by his own mother! Hebrews 11:23-24 The faith of Moses’ parents enabled them to keep him safe—in the arms of the Egyptian princess! Yet, Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh’s daughter –– he knew who he was. While people knew him to be a prince of Egypt, for Moses, his identity was never in question. However, Moses used his own ways to try to rescue his people from their taskmasters. He killed an Egyptian to save an Israelite slave. But Moses’ way of delivering Israel couldn’t “hold water” – it had to be God’s way. He had to learn this through brokenness – as a fugitive running away from the consequences of the grave sin he committed.{% endraw %}
