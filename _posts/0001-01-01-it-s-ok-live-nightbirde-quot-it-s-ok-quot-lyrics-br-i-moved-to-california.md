{% raw %}&quot; It's OK&quot; Lyrics:<br />I moved to California in the summer time<br />I changed my name thinking that it would change my mind<br />I thought that all my problems they would stay behind<br />I was a stick of dynamite and it was just a matter of time, yeah<br />All day, all night, now I can't hide<br />Said I knew myself but I guess I lied<br />It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay<br />If you're lost, we're all a little lost and it's alright<br />It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay<br />If you're lost, we're all a little lost and it's alright<br />It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright<br />I wrote a hundred pages but I burned them all<br />(Yeah, I burned them all)<br />I drove through yellow lights and don't look back at all<br />I don't look back at all<br />Yeah, you can call me reckless, I'm a cannonball (uh, I'm a cannonball)<br />Don't know why I take the tightrope and cry when I fall<br />All day, all night, now I can't hide<br />Said I knew what I wanted but I guess I lied<br />It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay<br />If you're lost, we're all a little lost and it's alright<br />It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay<br />If you're lost, we're all a little lost and it's alright<br />It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright<br />It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright<br />Oh-oh-oh-oh, it's alright<br />Oh-oh-oh-oh, it's alright<br />Oh-oh-oh-oh, it's alright<br />Oh-oh-oh-oh, it's alright<br />To be lost sometimes<br />It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay<br />If you're lost, we're all a little lost and it's alright<br />It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay<br />If you're lost, we're all a little lost and it's alright<br />It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay<br />If you're lost, we're all a little lost and it's alright<br />It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay<br />If you're lost, we're all a little lost and it's alright<br />It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay<br />If you're lost, we're all a little lost and it's alright<br /><br />Written by: Nightbirde <br />Original Production by: Geoff Duncan <br />Live by: Maple House Sessions<br />As seen on America's Got Talent.
