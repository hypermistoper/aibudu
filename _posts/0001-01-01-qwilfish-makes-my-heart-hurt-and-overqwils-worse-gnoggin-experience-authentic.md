It's more likely than you think! Because in Pokemon Legends Arceus Game Freak gave us Hisuian Qwilfish and a Qwilfish evolution named Overqwil! It's a BIIIIIG poisonous fish, and it's a dark-type pokemon now? Why is that? Why is it poison-type too? And why is it in Hisui of all places? And come to think of it, just how poisonous is Qwilfish? How could a Qwilfish kill you? Would it be a near-death experience? or would it be overkill?<br /><br />Help keep the channel alive!<br />Patreon   ‚û§   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/Gnoggin">http://www.patreon.com/Gnoggin</a><br />MERCH!  ‚û§   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gnoggin.net/">https://www.gnoggin.net/</a><br /><br />Socials:<br />Twitter    ‚û§   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/Lockstin">http://twitter.com/Lockstin</a><br />Instagram ‚û§ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/zmJDxr">https://goo.gl/zmJDxr</a><br /><br />Additional Credits:<br />Thumbnail art commissioned from: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Giodude1580">https://twitter.com/Giodude1580</a><br /><br />#qwilfish #overqwill #PokemonLegendsArceus<br /><br />Chapters<br />00:00 A video about Qwilfish<br />00:34 We don't talk about Qwilfish<br />01:40 Etymology<br />02:22 Sponsored by Sakuraco<br />03:27 Shibirefugu<br />05:00 The Fugu Pokemon<br />11:40 How Overqwil is OverKILL<br />15:50 Hisuian Qwilfish going extinct<br />16:39 Ebisu!
