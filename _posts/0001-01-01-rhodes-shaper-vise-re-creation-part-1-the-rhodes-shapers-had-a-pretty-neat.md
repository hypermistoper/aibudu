{% raw %}The Rhodes Shapers had a pretty neat little vise that came with them 100 years ago, but unfortunately, mine was missing when I got the machine.  Chirpy from @Chirpy's Tinkerings sent me drawings for one, so I figured I'd make my own version of it. This project ended up being much more involved than I anticipated, so here's part 1 of the build.{% endraw %}
