{% raw %}This is a second video of the suspended slab construction process series. We are 'jumping' on the decking and setting out the slab, marking the lines and staking out the points for all items.<br />As good civil engineers we are ready now and have all the below⬇️⬇️<br />At this point we should have all information in our Total Station (EDM). If we are using a robotic total station that would be DXF / CAD drawing and if we have TS06 (2 men EDM) we should have a points in for stakeout and I would recommend using a local grid system for all setting out with TS06. Remember to have a folder with all drawings with you all the time!– Ga, sections, details, M&amp;E etc. <br />When taking our EDM on top to set it, we need to have a look at the core to slab connection detail. We have to check if anything is missing and how it looks, as CF guys are already working there (they’re the first to jump there when it’s ready). <br />Setting our EDM using a monopod like Survipod, or survipod boltfix. We have the targets ready before and and this point we just want to make sure the resection is good and the error minimal. <br />Setting all the ‘soffit items’ first, especially if there are some soffit halfens, or plates (not really in resi blocks). Then we are marking the balconies to let the guys start installing the thermal break, slab edge and also marking the boxes and fire collar position at this point. When the EDM is set I also recommend to spot check the soffit level as now we can see what we got. <br />Keep checking and provide information all the time! Some items might be ready for you to inspect also, but more about this in the next video 😊 <br />Survipod products: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://survipod.com">https://survipod.com</a><br /><br />0:00 intro<br />0:12 Drawing to EDM<br />1:45 Setting up the Total Station<br />3:30 Slab setting out / marking<br />6:50 All good engineer needs<br />7:44 Join the community!<br /><br />JOIN the best engineering community 👍👍👍SUBSCRIBE NOW!!!👍👍👍<br />leave the THUMBS UP!!! and follow the LinkedIn page 😁<br /><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/siteng">https://www.linkedin.com/company/siteng</a><br />Ko-fi: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/siteng">https://ko-fi.com/siteng</a><br />#CivilEngineer#Construction#SettingOut{% endraw %}
