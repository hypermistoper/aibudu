If you wish to use it an awake method, you still can, just bypass a few affirmations or use your own! (Longer version available with just the music)<br /><br />Method credits go to Sunni (I cannot find a link to properly credit this person, if any of you guys know, please let me know and I will include it here.)<br /><br />This method works in 2 parts, you can use the first part as little dr exercises during your day, where you would emulate and feel like you are in your dr for a few minutes. (Kind of like reality checks for lucid dreaming)<br /><br />PS: I apologise for the stuffed nose, the cold is getting the best of me. Sorry!{% endraw %}
