Through the use of the tumescent technique, a patient's fatty tissue is injected with a large amount of fluid that makes it &quot;tumescent,&quot; which means &quot;swollen and firm.&quot;  This allows fat cells to be literally &quot;vacuumed&quot; out of the body. During this interactive liposuction procedure, you will mark the target area and numb the incision areas. Then you will inject the tumescent fluid into the target area before using a cannula to suction out the fat deposits through each tiny incision. You will also learn about liposuction recovery and the importance of lifestyle changes moving forward. The patient is ready, so go ahead and scrub in!{% endraw %}
