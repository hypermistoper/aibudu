For over three decades his innovative and real-world selling strategies have helped train sales leaders all around the world. Jeff’s unique approach to sales is informed by understanding the psychology of why people buy. Once you understand why people buy you can reverse engineer your sales style to meet the needs of the customer.<br /><br />Unlike some sales trainers, Jeff teachers his sales professionals to abandon scripted sales presentations, obnoxious closing lines and other antiquated “used car salesman” techniques in order to make meaningful, emotion-centered connections. Unsurprisingly, these sales strategies really work: last year, Jeff’s residential real estates sales training clients sold over $25 billion in residential real estate. If you are a sales manager or executive looking for ways to increase profits, better train your sales team or simply just “level up” in your current market, Jeff’s leadership training methods are going to get you there. <br /><br />LEARN MORE. <br />EARN MORE. <br />ENJOY YOUR LIFE MORE!<br /><br />- - - - <br /><br />QUICK LINKS:<br /><br />Want free video training each week? <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://jeffshore.com/">http://jeffshore.com/</a> <br /><br />Want to close more sales?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://jeffshore.com/closing-2-0-book/">http://jeffshore.com/closing-2-0-book/</a> <br /><br />Want to get inside your buyer’s mind?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://jeffshore.com/podcast">http://jeffshore.com/podcast</a> <br /><br />Want to become a “Market Proof” residential real estate sales company?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://jeffshore.com/summit">http://jeffshore.com/summit</a><br /><br />Want to improve your residential real estate conversions? <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://jeffshore.com/42fa">http://jeffshore.com/42fa</a> <br /><br />FOLLOW JEFF SHORE ONLINE:<br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://jeffshore.com">http://jeffshore.com</a> <br />Podcast : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://jeffshore.com/podcast/">https://jeffshore.com/podcast/</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/JeffShoreCommunity/">https://www.facebook.com/JeffShoreCommunity/</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/jeffshore">https://twitter.com/jeffshore</a> <br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://linkedin.com/in/jeffshore">http://linkedin.com/in/jeffshore</a>{% endraw %}
