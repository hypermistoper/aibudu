{% raw %}Fed up with sweeping up sawdust after a woodworking project? Then you need a dust collector! But don’t make one of those flimsy, plastic bucket versions! Go for an open-top steel drum like me! This step-by-step how-to video may be just what you need to put an end to collapsing dust collectors for good. <br /><br />In total I spent £59.47 buying the components and tools to build my sturdy open-top steel dust collector. <br /><br />The free items from my spare parts stash included: <br /> • 1m length of PVCu solvent weld white waste pipe (40mm diameter); and<br /> • various connecting tubes from previous dust collector build.<br /><br />The parts I needed to buy included:<br /> • 25 litre open top storage drum (£28.99 inc P&amp;P);<br /> • 90° PVCu solvent weld bend, white 40mm (78p);<br /> • 135° PVCu solvent weld bend, white 40mm (78p);<br /> • 3 x PVCu solvent weld straight coupling, white 40mm (£2.34); <br /> • HSS step drill bit, 4mm-42mm (£21.59); and<br /> • Draper grinding point set (£4.99).{% endraw %}
