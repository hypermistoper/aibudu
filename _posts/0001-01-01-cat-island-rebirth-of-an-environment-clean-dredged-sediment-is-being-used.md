{% raw %}Clean dredged sediment is being used to restore Cat Island in Green Bay. Triple benefits of the project are an improved shipping lane, lower cost storage of dredged material, and habitat restoration for many species including the endangered piping plover.  Please note that the island is currently closed to the public during construction and for the protection of the plover and other sensitive species.{% endraw %}
