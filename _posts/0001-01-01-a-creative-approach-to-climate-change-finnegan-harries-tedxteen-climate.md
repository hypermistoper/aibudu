{% raw %}Climate change is a fact. Calling all creatives. Finnegan Harries is a British designer and an architect-in-training at Parsons School of Design.<br /><br />In 2011, he founded the popular YouTube blog JacksGap with his twin brother Jack Harries. The blog has more than 4.1 million subscribers and 200 million views. The brothers have used their influence on YouTube and social media to drive dialogue around social and environmental challenges such as mental health and climate change.<br /><br />In 2015, Finn moved from London to New York to pursue a degree in architecture at Parsons School of Design. He will graduate in 2018. Finn also sits on the Executive Board of an American 501(c)(3) non-profit called The School Fund, where he advises on design and digital strategy. The School Fund provides scholarships to ambitious students in developing countries by crowdfunding what is needed and distributing grants through local partners in the countries where they work. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
