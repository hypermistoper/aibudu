{% raw %}This Should Have Anyone Who Preps Concerned<br />We prepare for any dangers or crisis scenarios that may exist and are aware of many all around the world. But, apparently most are right here in the USA.<br /><br />Preppers are an interesting group of people. At the end of the day, most of us just want to be left alone, operate freely and become as self sustaining as possible. Unfortunately, we also have a healthy skepticism of the world. By anticipating danger, we have learned to look ahead and speculate in order to create contingencies for any SHTF event that might happen. But, some might find that skepticism to be unacceptable.<br /><br />For more information on SHTF prepping, please visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.MagicPrepper.com">https://www.MagicPrepper.com</a><br /><br />Invader Coffee is what I'll be drinking in the apocalypse.
