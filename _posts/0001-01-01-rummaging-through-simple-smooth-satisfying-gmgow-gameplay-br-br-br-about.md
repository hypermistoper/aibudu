{% raw %}Simple, Smooth, Satisfying GMGoW+ Gameplay<br /><br /><br />About:<br />I play on the PS5 and have logged hundreds of hours performing Yggdrasil Dew runs to permanently increase Kratos' stats. This has given me access to tons of gear and experience - allowing me to learn the game intimately. My goal is to present the &quot;canon&quot; version of Kratos who can easily navigate the game's hardest difficulty of Give Me God of War (GMGoW).<br /><br /><br />Q&amp;A:<br />Q: What system do you play on?<br />A: PS5<br /><br />Q: How many hours have you played<br />A: 600+<br /><br />Q: How do you do the shield slam?<br />A: Horn of Heimdall Talisman<br /><br />Q: How do you rapid punch?<br />A: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/81qvEZIGyQQ">https://youtu.be/81qvEZIGyQQ</a><br /><br />Q: What is a Dew Run?<br />A: There are 12 Yggdrasil Dew in God of War that permanently boost your stats. The second time the water drops in the Lake of Nine is when you can collect all the Dew. The idea is that you play up until that point, collect the Dew and start a New Game+ (rinse and repeat). Dew runs take ~2-3 hours.<br /><br />Q: Why do you play so much<br />A: I simply love the game<br /><br /><br />Stat Caps:<br />Strength: ~450<br />Runic: ~250-300<br />Defense: Unsure but seems to scale well 500+<br />Vitality: No cap - 2 Vitality = 1 HP. After ~330 Vitality, Kratos will no longer stagger from being hit by ANY attack.<br />Luck: Unsure but I saw usefulness 300+<br />Cooldown: Hard cap 332<br /><br /><br />Additional Content:<br />My favorite build overview: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/EbqiCEiAzS0">https://youtu.be/EbqiCEiAzS0</a><br /><br />Sigrun World Record (current): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/CPK_6yQJlJk">https://youtu.be/CPK_6yQJlJk</a><br /><br />Sigrun World Record build breakdown: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/2c5w0WtCbgc">https://youtu.be/2c5w0WtCbgc</a><br /><br />My brother's GMGoW channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/user/MusclesMcMassive10">https://youtube.com/user/MusclesMcMassive10</a>{% endraw %}
