Being able to give your full attention to what matters in the moment is necessary whether your focus is work or involves being present in a conversation. Amishi Jha  is a professor of psychology at University of Miami and author of the new book, Peak Mind: Find Your Focus, Own Your Attention, Invest 12 Minutes a Day. She is unpacking why your wandering mind isn’t as big a problem as you think, how memories are formed and stories are ultimately created and stitched together to create our version of reality.

There's no point of that. The point of memory is to support our actions in the future.” [20:14]<br /><br />“My caution regarding stories is in our drive, in our desire to make something have meaning, [..] I may lose some aspect of what is useful and what is true.” [29:58]<br /><br />“When we take an observational stance, we can actually see the structure of the story, and that is very powerful.” [38:57]<br /><br />“In your pocket at all times, is the ability to let it go.” Tom Bilyeu [57:02]<br /><br />“Unless we are actively keeping the contents of our conscious experience, refreshed and rewritten moment by moment, they will fade away.” [58:36]<br /><br />Follow Amishi Jha: <br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amishi.com/">https://amishi.com/</a> <br />YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/AmishiPJha">https://www.youtube.com/user/AmishiPJha</a>  <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/amishijha">https://twitter.com/amishijha</a>  <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/amishipjha/">https://www.instagram.com/amishipjha/</a> <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/amishi.jha">https://www.facebook.com/amishi.jha</a>{% endraw %}
