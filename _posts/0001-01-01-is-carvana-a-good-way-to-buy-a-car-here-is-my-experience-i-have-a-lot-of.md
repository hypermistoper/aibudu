{% raw %}I have a lot of experience buying cars, more so than the average American. This video is part of a playlist on car buying tips. Recently (4 months ago from this post) we purchased a Ford Escape using Carvana. I was neither for Carvana going into it, nor against them. This video is my experience. It was very convenient and an overall good experience. <br /><br />If you decide to go with Carvana and need a referral link to get the Carvana gift worth between $200-$300 feel free to use my referral link below.<br />www.carvana.com/referrals/matthew-martz{% endraw %}
