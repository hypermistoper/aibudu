{% raw %}We moved to Germany from the USA in February of 2021, and our first time to go back was 10 months later, for Christmas! I honestly didn't think we'd notice many differences before we arrived, but I was wrong! We began to notice things right away that we'd forgotten about while living in Germany. We kept a list while there for two weeks, and sat down to record it for you all - 20 things in total, and we could've done more! There were many little things that by themselves aren't a big deal, but added up, they equal culture shocks. So here's our list of things we missed about Germany while in the USA, and things that were strange for us.<br /><br />This has been a much-requested video since we've returned - hope it meets your expectations and you enjoy it!<br /><br />//VIDEOS MENTIONED IN THIS VIDEO//<br />Surprising German Culture Shocks as Americans (Things You Haven't Heard Before) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YdeJwxMLGs&amp;t=164s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YdeJwxMLGs&amp;t=164s</a><br />German Math and Engineering - How Engineers are Made Here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OE5RBYzErk&amp;t=65s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-OE5RBYzErk&amp;t=65s</a><br />How Germany Makes it Easy to Get Outside and Be Active - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVkmge4PbkI&amp;t=411s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVkmge4PbkI&amp;t=411s</a><br />What's the DM Hype in Germany All About?
