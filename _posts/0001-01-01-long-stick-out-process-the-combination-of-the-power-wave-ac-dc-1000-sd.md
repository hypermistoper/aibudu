{% raw %}The combination of the Power Wave速 AC/DC 1000速 SD Inverter technology with the addition of an extension to the welding torch enables the long stick out process (LSO). The LSO relates to a physical principle which, by pre-heating the wire, improves the fusion of the filler metal and increases the deposit rate without changing the welding current or the travel speed.<br /><br /><br />Long stick out process can also be used with multiple arc procedure in order to get the optimum output from your Power Wave速 AC/DC 1000速 SD investment.{% endraw %}
