{% raw %}Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again sung by Sierra Boggess as Christine, followed by herself and Ramin Karimloo in a powerful rendition of the Phantom of the Opera title song. This performance of Phantom of the Opera is also available separately on this channel.<br /><br /><br /><br />You can briefly see Sir Andrew Lloyd-Webber in the audience between the two songs - I am sure he approved of this performance. Play it loud!<br /><br /><br /><br />Performed at the Royal Albert Hall on 2nd October 2012 at the Classic BRIT Awards and broadcast on ITV1 HD on 7 October 2012.{% endraw %}
