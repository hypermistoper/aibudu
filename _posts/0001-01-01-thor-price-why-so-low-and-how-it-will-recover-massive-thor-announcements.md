I compare it to POWER nodes which is another great passive income stream.<br /><br />Welcome to the channel! I want to be earning a living from passive income and micro caps by the end of 2022. I will share my learnings, failures and successes.<br /><br />Follow me on twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/danotworld">https://twitter.com/danotworld</a><br /><br />Disclaimer - This is not financial advice and I'm not a financial advisor.
