{% raw %}Another thing to keep in mind is that since Chill Clip's requirement to only proc when you have at least 50% of your magazine, mag perks specifically &quot;Enhanced Battery&quot; will increase the number of bullets in the mag from 7 to 8 increasing the Chill Clip up time from 4 bullets to 5 bullets (because it rounds up).<br /><br />I wanted to say more about this fusion but just wanted to keep the video short and focused on the perk showcased, since it's a playlist weapon it does have 12 perks in each of the trait columns, making it extremely hard to get this exact roll.<br /><br />Most overlays in this videos are from these sources;<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://d2gunsmith.com/">https://d2gunsmith.com/</a> &amp; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.light.gg/">https://www.light.gg/</a><br /><br />Hoped this video helps!
