You might have noticed a kind of duopoly in the market when it comes to high performance and gaming computers. You have either an Intel processor, or an AMD one. That’s because Intel was the one to develop the original X86 instruction set Architecture. Later on Intel and AMD agreed to have a cross license that’s royalty free. That’s because While AMD had an X86 license, they greatly improved on it building X86-64 .Recently, they introduced their 1 billion dollar fund for innovation in the manufacturing space, and within this initiative, X86 is about to get a new life. <br /><br />See, they want RISC V and ARM innovations and want it to work with their CPU’s. Theres a heavy focus on chiplet here, but within that, we have bob brennan , the vice president of customer solutions engineering at Intel's Foundry Services saying “ We have what we call a multi ISA strategy. That's the first time in Intel's history we'll license x86 soft cores and hard cores to customers who would like to develop chips.” For reference, a soft cores license.. Keep it in your pants, but the soft cores are essentially a sort of emulation…<br /><br />Moving on but sticking with intel, their GPU’s are apparently in trouble ? So, within the past year, we’ve seen a lot of rumors praising the Alchemist architecture. According to moores law is dead, their GPU’s would have RTX 3070 ti levels of performance which is impressive to say the least, the drivers would apparently be ok too. But recently, other people with connections in the industry are saying something different. First, we have not an apple fan over on twitter who’s been sitting on some info for some time. He said that the top of the line ARC gpu is about as fast as a 5700 XT.<br /><br />————————————————<br />———————————————— <br />About Boot Sequence:<br />Snows and the rest of the Boot Sequence team are here to bring you the latest breaking Tech News.
