{% raw %}My eBook and Training Program: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebioneer.com/product/superfunctional/">https://www.thebioneer.com/product/superfunctional/</a><br /><br />My print book: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebioneer.com/product/functional-training-and-beyond/">https://www.thebioneer.com/product/functional-training-and-beyond/</a><br /><br />The post and full program: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebioneer.com/bulletproofing-workout/">https://www.thebioneer.com/bulletproofing-workout/</a><br /><br />I designed this bulletproofing workout for myself to help prevent injuries before they happen - by strengthening weaker areas, enforcing good habits, and enhancing mobility.<br /><br />We have a tendency to wait until we injure something to then start performing rehab and prehab movements to &quot;fix&quot; the problem. As they say: prevention is better than cure! By incorporating bulletproofing exercises into a full bulletproofing workout, we can minimize the risk of injuries occurring in the first place.<br /><br />An added benefit: strengthening weaker areas also enhances performance by increasing stability and generally enhancing strength.<br /><br />I'd love to hear your top bulletproofing exercises in the comments below!<br /><br />Timestamps, because I love ya:<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />01:17 - Hindu Squats<br />03:31 - Gamma Cast<br />05:20 - Kettlebell Ballistic Row<br />07:18 - Bodyweight Good Morning<br />09:11 - Tibia Raise<br />11:06 - Bodyweight Row<br />12:33 - Sumo Squat + Leg Lift<br />14:57 - Camel Pose<br />15:25 - Hangs<br />16:44 - Wrist Curls<br /><br /><br />The website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thebioneer.com​​">https://www.thebioneer.com​​</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/thebioneer​​">https://www.facebook.com/thebioneer​​</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thebioneer​​">https://www.patreon.com/thebioneer​​</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thebioneer​​">https://www.instagram.com/thebioneer​​</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/thebioneer">https://www.twitter.com/thebioneer</a>{% endraw %}
