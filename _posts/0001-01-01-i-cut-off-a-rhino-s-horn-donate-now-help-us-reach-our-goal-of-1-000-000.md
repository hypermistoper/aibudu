Poaching, habitat loss, and genetic fragmentation have collectively pushed rhino populations to the brink of extinction. Illegal and deadly horn poaching is far and wide the greatest threat to rhinos. To deter this gruesome practice often calls for extreme measures… like chainsawing off a rhino’s horn.  <br /><br />This is the reality of the fight to save rhinos. <br /><br />In this episode, Coyote’s on-location at the Kariega Game Reserve shadowing the incredible Dr. William Fowlds as he conducts two important veterinary rhino procedures. It’s a race against the clock to protect these vanishing giants before they’re lost forever. <br /><br />We have a plan to put things back on track. Brave Wilderness is partnering with Kariega Game Reserve, Global Conservation Force and Bear Grylls to Save The Horns.  <br /><br />Learn more at savethehorns.com <br /><br />A massive thank you to Kariega Game Reserve, Dr. William Fowlds, Global Conservation Force, and to YOU for doing your part. <br /><br /><br />PLEASE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REENACT OR RECREATE ANY EVENTS OR SCENES  FROM OUR VIDEOS.
