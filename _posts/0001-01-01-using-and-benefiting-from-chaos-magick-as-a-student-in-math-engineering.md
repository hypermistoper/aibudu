{% raw %}In this voiceover, I'm answering a subscriber question regarding how students can benefit from using Chaos Magick. Specifically, the original question requested a short listing of books on a recommendation regarding University studies involving Math and Engineering.<br /><br />Here, I detail 4 books in particular: Sigils of Power and Transformation by Adam Blackthorne; The 72 Angels of Magick by Damon Brand; Success Magick by Damon Brand and Magickal Divinity by Damon Brand. In regards to The 72 Angels of Magick, I do provide a short list of angels that can be invoked by a student to assist them in learning subject information; memory retention; improving test and exam performance and  other areas. <br /><br />People with an interest in other areas, such as Art, Music, Writing, etc, there is an additional video that covers these specific areas.{% endraw %}
