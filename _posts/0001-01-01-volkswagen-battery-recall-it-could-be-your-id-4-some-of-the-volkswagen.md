{% raw %}SOME of the Volkswagen ID 4's are being Recalled due to High Voltage Battery Issues. LG, the battery manufacturer, has corrected the issue but 351 ID 4 from 2021 were affected by the issue. Volkswagen will be notifying Owners and Dealerships on May 13, 2022 about the Battery Recall. Volkswagen has not yet provided a remedy for the issue but we will soon know if the battery requires replacement.<br /><br />Link to Recall Notice:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2021/VOLKSWAGEN/ID.4/SUV/RWD#recalls">https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2021/VOLKSWAGEN/ID.4/SUV/RWD#recalls</a><br /><br />JK EV 20k miles review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/tvIPBZ2EQhQ">https://youtu.be/tvIPBZ2EQhQ</a><br />JK EV Trip to Disney Battery Issue: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/pOw71h-6hyk">https://youtu.be/pOw71h-6hyk</a><br /><br />As an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.<br /><br />Link for Tesla to J1772 Charging adapter:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Kek9wh">https://amzn.to/3Kek9wh</a><br /><br />Link for J1772 to Tesla Charging Adapter:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3xWbAnn">https://amzn.to/3xWbAnn</a>{% endraw %}
