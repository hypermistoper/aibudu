{% raw %}What happens when people complain that a game is too difficult and people say it's just impossible to beat the AI? Well it sounds like it's time for a pro exploiter in the form of me the Spiffing Brit to reveal the best strategy in the form of video game glitches and bugs that break the Ballance of the game and turn an impossible game into a walk in the park. Today we are playing heroes hour which is one of my favourite games and as always I like a challenge so we are playing on hardcore+ with all the advanced difficulty settings also turned up to impossible game levels! <br /><br />so it's time for me to flex my exploit skills and break the game with infinite money, infinite money and infinite skills. My power is unstoppable and I will defeat this impossible challenge with all of my cheats and tips and tricks that exist for us exploiters! <br /><br />What you have seen here today is part of a fantastic perfectly balanced series on youtube where I go from game to game and break them with wacky exploits to gain things like unlimited gold. If you enjoyed this then be sure to check out more. The style is similar to RT game and callmekevin in parts. A large influence on this series has come from Valefisk and The Killian Experience. <br /><br /><br />Join this channel to get access to perks:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRHXUZ0BxbkU2MYZgsuFgkQ/join</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing">https://www.patreon.com/Spiffing</a><br />Twitter: @thespiffingbrit<br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/spiffing">https://discord.gg/spiffing</a><br /><br />00:00 - INTRODUCING...
