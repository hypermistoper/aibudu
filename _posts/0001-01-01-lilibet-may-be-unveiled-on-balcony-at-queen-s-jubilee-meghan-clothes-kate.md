{% raw %}ðŸ’  Today we will have a chinwag about the Royal Easter Fashion Parade, Meg's bizarre wardrobe, Invictus PR success, and the distressing news regarding Harkle invitation to the Royal Balcony for the unveiling of Lilibet.<br /><br />ðŸ’– My Tip Jar for those who have kindly asked: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/theriverbank">https://www.paypal.me/theriverbank</a> (click the link and select 'Send')<br /><br />ðŸ’  DISCLAIMER: The River Show is presented as lighthearted entertainment with genuine opinion pieces and a dash of comedy, parody and a sprinkling of theatre. Commentary is offered in the style of conjecture and gossip, with the viewer encouraged to take all views and opinions expressed with a pinch of salt and use their own discretion.  I'm not a royal expert, and am not here to educate you. I'm here to shoot the breeze, have a giggle and sip the tea. Thanks for your company and I hope you enjoy the show.<br /><br />ðŸ’   I don't use social media including Instagram, Facebook or Twitter and I don't accept gifts, emails or post.  Thank you for your understanding.{% endraw %}
