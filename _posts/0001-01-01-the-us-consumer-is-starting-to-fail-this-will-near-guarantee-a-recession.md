SCHEDULE YOUR FREE PORTFOLIO REVIEW with Wealthion's endorsed financial advisors at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wealthion.com">https://www.wealthion.com</a><br /><br />Right now, the world’s focus is on how hot inflation is running right now. And that’s completely understandable. <br /><br />But in terms of where we should be placing our concern, we may be getting distracted from the true threat. Which, hard as it may be to believe right now, is much more on the deflationary side of things.<br /><br />If you’ve watched the recent videos on this channel, you’ve heard many of our recent expert interview guests paint the picture of the many storm clouds gathering on the macroeconomic horizon.<br /><br />But there’s a concept you haven’t heard them mention yet, called “debt saturation”.<br /><br />I was first introduced to this concept over a decade ago by my good friend Charles Hugh Smith who runs the excellent website OfTwoMinds.com. Debt saturation was a significant factor in triggering the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, and now once again, it looks poised to potentially pull today’s economy into recession within the year ahead.<br /><br />I recorded this video to explain its importance.<br />_________<br /><br />At Wealthion, we show you how to protect and build your wealth by learning from the world’s top experts on finance and money. Each week we add new videos that provide you with access to the foremost specialists in investing, economics, the stock market, real estate and personal finance.<br /><br />We offer exceptional interviews and explainer videos that dive deep into the trends driving today's markets, the economy, and your own net worth. We give you strategies for financial security, practical answers to questions like “how to grow my investments?”, and effective solutions for wealth building tailored to 'regular' investors just like you.<br /><br />There’s no doubt that it's a very challenging time right now for the average investor. Above and beyond the recent economic impacts of COVID, the new era of record low interest rates, runaway US debt and US deficits, and trillions of dollars in monetary and fiscal stimulus stimulus has changed the rules of investing by dangerously distorting the Dow index, the S&amp;P 500, and nearly all other asset prices. Can prices keep rising, or is there a painful reckoning ahead? <br /><br />Let us help you prepare your portfolio just in case the future brings one or more of the following: inflation, deflation, a bull market, a bear market, a market correction, a stock market crash, a real estate bubble, a real estate crash, an economic boom, a recession, a depression, or another global financial crisis.<br /><br />Put the wisdom from the money &amp; markets experts we feature on Wealthion into action by scheduling a free consultation with Wealthion’s endorsed financial advisors, who will work with you to determine the right next steps for you to take in building your wealth.<br /><br />SCHEDULE YOUR FREE WEALTH CONSULTATION with Wealthion's endorsed financial advisors here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.wealthion.com/">https://www.wealthion.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to our YouTube channel <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKMeK-HGHfUFFArZ91rzv5A?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKMeK-HGHfUFFArZ91rzv5A?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Follow Adam on Twitter <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/menlobear">https://twitter.com/menlobear</a><br /><br />Follow us on Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Wealthion-109680281218040">https://www.facebook.com/Wealthion-109680281218040</a><br /><br />#inflation #recession #debt<br />____________________________________<br />IMPORTANT NOTE: The information and opinions offered in this video by Wealthion or its interview guests are for educational purposes ONLY and should NOT be construed as personal financial advice.
