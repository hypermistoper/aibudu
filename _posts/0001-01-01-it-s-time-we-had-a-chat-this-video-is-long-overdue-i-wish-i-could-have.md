{% raw %}This video is long overdue, I wish I could have filmed this sooner but for reasons out of my control I needed to wait for the right time to share this... They say that when one door closes another opens and I have learnt so much about myself and business in this process and now that I can look back on this situation, I know that I made the right decision even though I knew it would be a difficult process. I am sad that I had to let go of things but this is the best possible outcome given the circumstances and I am so happy that I have complete control over my companies again so that I can focus on what I am passionate about, creating! It was important for me to be as honest and open as I can with you guys about the decisions that were made. If you have any questions or things you might need help with please feel free to comment, email or DM me and I will answer and try to help as best I can! Thank you for being on this journey with me, Love Jess x<br /><br />üîî DON'T FORGET to Subscribe &amp; hit that bell icon to get a notification when I upload ü•∞ <br /><br />SHOP MY GYMSHARK FITS: <br />ü¶à  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gym.sh/Shop-Jessica-Olie">https://gym.sh/Shop-Jessica-Olie</a> <br /><br />FOLLOW ME:<br />‚ù§Ô∏è INSTAGRAM - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/jessicaolie/">https://www.instagram.com/jessicaolie/</a><br />‚ù§Ô∏è TIKTOK - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMLjhEgnB/">https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMLjhEgnB/</a><br /><br />Love Jess{% endraw %}
