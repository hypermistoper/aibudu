{% raw %}r/place has once again proved that anything is possible when redditors collaborate to build something creative. <br /><br />Watching r/place unfold in real time was incredible, but seeing it again as a timelapse is even better. Catch up on the moments you missed while you were asleep or offline, which for some of you were few and far between.<br /><br />Thank you to everyone who came, collaborated, and dropped a pixel (or a hundred). Maybe the real art was the friends we made along the way.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://reddit.app.link/wX0mhGPe9ob">https://reddit.app.link/wX0mhGPe9ob</a>{% endraw %}
