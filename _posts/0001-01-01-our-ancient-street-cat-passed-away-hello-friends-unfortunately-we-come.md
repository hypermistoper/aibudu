{% raw %}Hello friends! Unfortunately, we come bearing some sad news - our ancient ex-street-cat Crusty passed away a little while ago at the ripe old age of 21.  So we decided to make a little memorial video for him here, as a celebration of his long, dusty life and how much he impacted ours. We met him back in 2015 on the streets, he was there when we started our channel - he judged my ugly clothing and lounged in a giant beanbag - and when we moved across the country, he came too. Tyler &amp; I loved him like crazy, and we're gonna miss him like crazy - and we know that a lot of you guys will too.<br /><br />A huge thanks to Shelby &amp; Sandy for the really sick art piece - you can check them out here! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shelbyandsandy/">https://www.instagram.com/shelbyandsandy/</a><br /><br />MUSIC<br />Via AudioNetwork<br /><br />PRODUCED &amp; EDITED by<br />Safiya Nygaard<br />Tyler Williams<br />Hannah Bruce<br /><br />GFX by Dayana Espinoza{% endraw %}
