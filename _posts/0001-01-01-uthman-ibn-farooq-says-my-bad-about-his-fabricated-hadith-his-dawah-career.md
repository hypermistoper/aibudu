Daughter ofChrist reveals that the text is just an edited version of an answer on the Islamqa website!<br /><br />Uthman's Full 'My Bad' Response: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOIpGEF5cw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbOIpGEF5cw</a><br />Qortoby 3:45 Source:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://quran.ksu.edu.sa/tafseer/qortobi/sura3-aya45.html">http://quran.ksu.edu.sa/tafseer/qortobi/sura3-aya45.html</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://islamqa.info/en/answers/247475/what-is-the-name-of-eesa-peace-be-upon-him-in-the-books-of-the-jews-why-is-it-different-from-the-name-mentioned-in-the-quran">https://islamqa.info/en/answers/247475/what-is-the-name-of-eesa-peace-be-upon-him-in-the-books-of-the-jews-why-is-it-different-from-the-name-mentioned-in-the-quran</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/247475/اسم-عيسى-عليه-السلام-في-لغة-بني-اسراىيل">https://islamqa.info/ar/answers/247475/اسم-عيسى-عليه-السلام-في-لغة-بني-اسراىيل</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Contact us via Skype: DCCI Ministries <br />Email us: info@dcciministries.com <br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/dcciministries?lang=en">https://twitter.com/dcciministries?lang=en</a><br />Follow us on our blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dcciministries.com">https://www.dcciministries.com</a><br />Follow us on Rumble <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rumble.com/user/DCCIMinistries">https://rumble.com/user/DCCIMinistries</a><br />If you would like to invite us to speak in your church or university, with training and debating help kindly email info@dcciministries.com <br />To support the work of DCCI Ministries <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/dcciministries2019?locale.x=en_GB">https://paypal.me/dcciministries2019?locale.x=en_GB</a><br /><br />DCCI Ministries seek to preach the Gospel to Muslims using apologetics and polemics. <br />Like the Apostle Paul, &quot;we do not use deception, nor do we distort the Word of God&quot; (2 Cor 4:2). Rather &quot;we demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God.&quot; Our motivation is love for Muslims to bring them to repentance and faith in Christ for eternal life.<br /><br />*Disclaimer- Speakers Corner, London UK, is a unique place in the world for freedom of Speech.
