{% raw %}The whole system is an abomination . It used to be that the Fed was there for short term liquidity issues because banks lend long term and borrow short term. THEN, the Fed started micromanaging the economy and the stock market. Then they became the liquidity spigot for Wall Street. QE to save the system, in 2009. QE to save the all time highs in the stock market , in 2019 and record employment . Same medicine for diametrically opposite conditions. Now, how can that be? The Central Bankers have disallowed the cycles that flush these excesses, and now the Fed is confounded by the mess they have created. The system requires constant expansion&quot;, so it warrants constant QE. The Fed is trying to keep all charts running low left to upper right and its effing ridiculous. They have created a beast they cant handle. More QE will only lead to a bigger crash down the road and $20 Big Macs. If we don't, then the compounding interest on the debt will get us, you can't fight the math in the end. There is no rescue; they have been re-animating the corpse for 10 years. the liquidity and fiat flows are all that is left;but the $120 Billion a night is not providing enough 'free money' in the system. The FED will try to keep on proping up the markets by printing more money until they break the workers with inflation, then there will be a collapse much worse than the great depression that will bring in the mark of the beast. Cash and gold my friends. Welcome to The Atlantis Report. I bet the FED and Trump will do anything and everything in their power to prevent the stock market from crashing before the election, even to the extend of going full Zero Interest Rates ;plus QE; plus REPO ;plus Helicopter Money; plus Whatever as soon as the crisis arrives. But remember , Printing will work until it doesn't. History is filled with lurid examples. When it doesn't work will be decided by many unusual factors already in play. Never before has the world had to contend with derivative markets - unregulated. This system was wired to 'pull it' decades ago. Pain, lots of it then a new system minus the banks. This is the game we are in: The Debt must ever expand or the whole system implodes. Interest, my friends, is ever eating up the dollars that were created by debt. If the debt is to be paid, then more must be created constantly to keep enough &quot;money&quot; in the system to pay the interest. When we can't pay the interest, it's game over. Money is DEBT. In our world since 1913. Never forget that. Today there is too much debt out there and these crooked banksters are lining up to see whom daddy FED will let live by handing them some fake money to keep their Ponzi afloat. Like shale oil, where they have loaned more &quot;money&quot; than there is oil in the ground. Who was the irresponsible one? Who should pay? the banks. They can go bankrupt;just like the rest of us can and do. JP Morgan added 11 trillion in derivatives to there books in the last couple of months, wonder how that will shake out. Who simply can't go whining to the Fed for a bailout. Derivative bursts can't be plugged up. Bring all down. It looks the fed is being gamed by JP Morgan at the expense of the other banks. In every case JP Morgan makes out like the bandit it is. The FED Prints new and the American Public is on the hook again for another round of QE. The Fox, Main Stream Media will play it up nicely. The FED has no problems but they want to get ahead of China creating problems in the Banking system, in case they hack into our system we need Ample supply of Cash on hand says Steve Mnuchin and Jay Powell. &quot;it will be a great christmas for all americans, we just have to watch out for the bad guys, the ones stealing intellectual property&quot; Is it not that they are all so big now ; that the amount of Free Cash in the system just is NOT ENOUGH for play dates . Once you start QE you cannot stop it. Trying the pullback that Bernanke Promised in 2012 was a joke that lasted 8 months and died in December. They have been trying to play catchup ever since. But T-bills did nothing and here we are. A year or 3 behind what should have been QE forever (just to maintain). <br /><br /><br />For the full transcript go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://financearmageddon.blogspot.com">https://financearmageddon.blogspot.com</a><br />ðŸ‘‰ Donate to help The Channel:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/vqbgwld">https://tinyurl.com/vqbgwld</a><br />ðŸ‘‰ Amazon Affiliate Links : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/sqwekhd">https://tinyurl.com/sqwekhd</a><br /> Support the channel by clicking here before you start shopping on Amazon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/sqwekhd">https://tinyurl.com/sqwekhd</a> (heck, even bookmark it for future use if you're feeling extra generous). <br />Thank you to all my loyal fans i love each and everyone one of you Please **like and subscribe**  <br />ðŸ‘‰ Follow us on Facebook : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/theatlantisr...">https://www.facebook.com/theatlantisr...</a><br /><br />and on twitter : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/atlantis_report">https://twitter.com/atlantis_report</a><br />This presentation contains images that were used under a Creative Commons License.
