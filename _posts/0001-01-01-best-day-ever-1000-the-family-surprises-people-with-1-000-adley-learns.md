{% raw %}we really appreciate everyone who enjoys these memories with our family!! THANKS!<br />JOIN THE FAM!! --- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://goo.gl/rfgp8V">http://goo.gl/rfgp8V</a><br /><br />Best Helping Day Ever 1000<br /><br />WELCOME TO BEST DAY EVER 1000!! It blows my mind that we’ve had that many and we don’t plan on stopping anytime soon. So to celebrate, we’re doing things a little different. We didn’t want today to just be about us, we want to help people have the Best Day Ever too! Jenny and I came up with an idea that includes Adley and Niko and will be tons of family fun! What we want to do is get $1000 out of the bank and use it to help others have the best day ever!!<br /><br />So it’s off to the store to buy supplies, we need to get stuff so we can leave notes to people as we go. While we’re there, Adley has the great idea of getting toys and coloring books we can give to kids! But it doesn’t stop there. We hide money in books, boxes of diapers, and we pay for the groceries of a stranger! It’s so much fun and it’s actually a really good opportunity to teach Adley about serving other people. On our way out of the store,  Adley and I put quarters in every candy and toy machine, so when little kids come up they can have an awesome little surprise to make their day! And we actually get to see the result cause shortly after we leave, a little boy walks over to the machine and is so happy!!<br /><br />It’s then off to lunch and while we’re in the drive thru, we pay for the people’s food that are behind us. Really wish we could have seen their reactions, I’m sure they would have been priceless. As we head back home where Adley, mom, and dad start leaving presents on people's porches. <br /><br />But best day ever 1000 wouldn’t be complete without the Spacestation and the crew!! So Jenny and I come up with a little game inspired by our old channel “Spacestation Stuff” so we can play a new game with the crew and say thank you to them and help them have the best day ever!! We have tons of fun with the guys and think back on some of our memories of the vlog, before Jenny and I are back on the road.<br /><br />Our last stop is to a place that helps people who have lost their homes or who are struggling to get their first homes, it’s a good cause and we decide to send it and give them the rest of our money!<br /><br />What an amazing journey this has been. All the crazy adventures we’ve had since we started this vlog. All the amazing people we’ve met through doing this, and I’m talking about people like you! We would be nothing without you guys!! So thank you so much for watching!! We love sharing our lives with you and hope that we can help you have the best day ever every single day!!<br /><br />\\\\<br />Watch Adley's last video:HOW TO FIX A BIKE!!
