{% raw %}Yesterday at cup of the day we played a type of map that we haven't had in a very long time actually. I'm speaking about a so-called &quot;Nascar&quot; map in Trackmania. Before you may wonder: No, it's not like an irl Nascar map, woukd be a little bit too boring I guess. Nonetheless there are certain parallels between the Trackmania Nascar and the real life Nascar.<br />In Trackmania, Nascar maps have a very high average speed and are fully based on tarmac, mostly on the normal roads. These type of maps are all about having perfect racing lines all the way through the map, quite a bit like Formula1 but with only fast turns and no stuff like hairpines. Nonetheless there occasionally still are slides on the map, similar to those that you can find on speedtech. <br />Although the maps in general are extremely simple, the gaps usually still are quite big because you can risk so ridiculously much. And that's also exactly the reason why I absolutely love these type of maps, super glad to have one again!<br /><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/granadyy">https://www.twitch.tv/granadyy</a><br />Main Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GranaDy">https://www.youtube.com/c/GranaDy</a><br />Clips Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzpaOq5_NbX5KnkIEByiggA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzpaOq5_NbX5KnkIEByiggA</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/GranaDyy">https://twitter.com/GranaDyy</a><br />Discord Server: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/Q25bJnUDxb">https://discord.gg/Q25bJnUDxb</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/granadytm/">https://www.instagram.com/granadytm/</a><br />_____________________________________________________________________<br /><br />Useful links:<br />-Ranking for Cup of the Day: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/cotd_ranking">http://bit.ly/cotd_ranking</a><br />-Openplanet: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://openplanet.nl/">https://openplanet.nl/</a><br />-Openplanet Dashboard Plugin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://openplanet.nl/files/103">https://openplanet.nl/files/103</a><br />-Support me: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/GranaDy">https://www.paypal.me/GranaDy</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!{% endraw %}
