On your journey of figuring out how to lose weight there's a good chance you're using a body weight scale  (weight scale) to track your progress.<br /><br />And if you're using a weight loss scale you've probably wondered, &quot;Why does my weight fluctuate?,&quot; &quot;Why does my weight go up and down?,&quot; &quot;Why is my weight fluctuating?&quot; or any other question having to do with weight fluctuations. Weight fluctuation on the scale is incredibly common and normal, in this video I even show you what my scale weight has been doing recently. But even though they're normal, they can still be annoying and confusing.<br /><br />As a weight loss coach I see so many women being misled by the number on the scale so in this video we're going to talk about how to understand the number that shows up on the scale &amp; put it into context, explain why the scale isn't budging (even if you are losing body fat), and I give some recommendations for affordable scales (hint: they are not smart scales).<br /><br />Scales mentioned:<br />*Amazon Basics Scale: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ejYKE6">https://amzn.to/3ejYKE6</a><br />*WW26 Scale: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3gvlcN8">https://amzn.to/3gvlcN8</a><br />*EatSmart Scale: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2PgaSO0">https://amzn.to/2PgaSO0</a><br /><br />*These are affiliate links which earn me a small commission on your purchase.
