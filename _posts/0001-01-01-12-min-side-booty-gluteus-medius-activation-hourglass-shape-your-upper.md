{% raw %}Oh gosh - I was shaking haha ♥︎ a fireeeee Booty Activation Routine - especially for the Gluteus Medius! <br /><br />What’s the Gluteus Medius? <br />Our butt consists out of 3 muscles. And if you want to make the Kardashian’s envy your booty, we gotta work on all of them :D The gluteus medius helps to create an hourglass figure &amp; make your hips rounder - at the top side part. It’s the muscle you touch when you run your hands down the sides of your back.<br /><br />▸ without squats, lunges or jumps <br />▸ floor only, low impact, knee friendly <br />▸ for round hips &amp; a full top booty <br /><br />For this workout, I find the MIND MUSCLE CONNECTION extra important! It helps to:<br />#1 - Keep your leg super straight <br />#2 - Don’t lift it to the front. You will work the front of your hips instead. If it’s difficult to follow for you, try to lift it a biiiit backwards.  <br />#3 - Do all the lifts sloooow, never swing! <br />#4 - Touch your upper booty &amp; make sure the muscle is working. <br /><br />__<br /><br />Adding a resistance band is definitely helpful to put more focus on the booty. I can especially recommend it, if you want to target the sides of your butt. In case you don't have a booty band yet - don't worry! You can still do this workout :)<br /><br />If you need breaks - TAKE THEM! Don't worry too much about that. You will improve over time :) The video is in full length which means you can just follow whatever I’m doing 30s for each exercise. <br /><br />__<br /><br />➞ my Pam App ♥︎ Free workout plans (11 versions, different fitness levels), lot of recipes &amp; tips: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pam-app.de/app">https://www.pam-app.de/app</a><br /><br />▸ 2 of those FREE WORKOUT PLANS are on my Instagram Channel. <br />Lose Weight &amp; Focus on a Bubble Butt.
