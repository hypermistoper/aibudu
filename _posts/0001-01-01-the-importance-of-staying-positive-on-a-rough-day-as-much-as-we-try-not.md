{% raw %}As much as we try, not every day is fantastic. That is life. Rough days are normal for everyone. Our goal is to stay positive on the days that are not so great. Are we successful every time we try? Nope. But, today was a great example of making a long rough day not so bad. I can think of so many ways this day could have went downhill, but it didn't. #weefam #autism<br /><br />Like this video?
