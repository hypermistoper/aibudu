Damaged proteins can cause a lot of problems throughout the body and can also make you look old. <br /><br />A big cause of damaged proteins is AGEs (advanced glycation end products). To get rid of AGEs, you need to get your body into a condition called autophagy. Autophagy recycles old damaged proteins to make new ones. This is essential to help you look younger. <br /><br />The best way to get into autophagy is by doing intermittent fasting. If you're already doing intermittent fasting, you can also try OMAD (one meal a day). If you're experienced with OMAD, you could try dry OMAD. <br /><br />Additional ways to look younger:<br /> • Get plenty of sun or infrared light <br /> • Support your liver <br /> • Support bile production <br /> • Consume enough fat in your diet <br /> • Consume plenty of vegetables and have them with fat (like olive oil) <br /> • Support your antioxidant networks (by doing exercise and fasting) <br /> • Don't consume sugar or refined carbs <br /> • Stop smoking <br /> • Work hard to counter stress  <br /> • Make sure you consume a moderate amount of high-quality protein <br /> • Support your microbiome <br /><br />Follow Me On Social Media:<br />Facebook:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/FB-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/FB-DrBerg</a><br />Instagram:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/IG-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/IG-DrBerg</a><br />Anchor:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Anchor-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/Anchor-DrBerg</a><br />TikTok:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/TikTok-DrBerg">https://bit.ly/TikTok-DrBerg</a><br /><br />ADD YOUR SUCCESS STORY HERE:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description">https://www.drberg.com/add-client-success-story?utm_source=youtube&amp;utm_medium=description</a><br /><br />FREE COURSE➜ ➜ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse">http://bit.ly/BulletproofImmuneSystemCourse</a><br /><br />Talk to a Dr. Berg Keto Consultant today and get the help you need on your journey.
