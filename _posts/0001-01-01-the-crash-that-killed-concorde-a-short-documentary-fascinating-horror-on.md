{% raw %}On the 25th of July, 2000, Air France Flight 4590 from Paris to New York took flight. The plane was a Concorde airliner – a supersonic jet that, in the years prior, had achieved almost worldwide fame by offering incredibly swift, luxurious and timely transatlantic flights. The distinctive aircraft had come to be a symbol of wealth and success, luxury and ambition… but on this particular day Concorde would stand for something else. It would be the beginning of the end for Concorde, and the end of everything for every single person on board Flight 4590.<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:52 - Background<br />04:23 - The Crash<br />07:49 - The Aftermath<br /><br />I tell the true stories behind some of history's greatest disasters... but without sensationalism or disturbing imagery.
