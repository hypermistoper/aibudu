{% raw %}To be any good at the game of golf you must have the ability to coach yourself. Great golfers are able to feel what they are doing wrong in their golf swing and make quick improvements out on the golf course.<br /><br />It's this self reliance that makes them so consistent.<br /><br />When you are out playing golf there is no one telling you what to do. If you come up against a problem you need a way to solve it. In todays golf lesson which you can access here, I want to show you how you too can make swing improvements quickly.<br /><br />Everyone has the ability to learn golf quicker. Unfortunately with so much information out there on how to swing a golf club, are heads have often become muddled with so many swing thoughts, we have lost the ability to fully experience and feel our golf swings.<br /><br />What you're about to learn might surprise you but what I can guarantee is it really does work. It's the corner stone of my entire golf coaching philosophy <br /><br />I wish I knew this when I first started playing golf as a beginner golfer.<br /><br />►Become a FREE SUBSCRIBER to DANNY MAUDE now <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/subdannymaudegolf">http://bit.ly/subdannymaudegolf</a><br /><br />PRACTICE PLAN<br />Here's the practice plan and summary of this weeks lesson<br />⛳️ Released on Monday 28th<br />#simplegolftips #subscribe #dannymaudegolf<br /><br />Join his facebook Community here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/dannymaudefan">https://www.facebook.com/dannymaudefan</a><br /><br />WATCH NEXT<br />○ Golf Swing Made Simple - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/-SwO_RUwieE">https://youtu.be/-SwO_RUwieE</a><br />○ Hit the Golf Ball First - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/N7EJ12GSCPI">https://youtu.be/N7EJ12GSCPI</a><br />○ The Perfect Takeaway Drill - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/wqhXzwiFCJY">https://youtu.be/wqhXzwiFCJY</a><br />○ Best Rotational Drills  - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/GXX61LiW0Qg">https://youtu.be/GXX61LiW0Qg</a><br />○ Simplest Short Game Technique - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/HxvAJNqdxOU">https://youtu.be/HxvAJNqdxOU</a><br /><br />COME SAY HI!<br />○ Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dannymaude.com">https://dannymaude.com</a><br />○ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dannymaude">https://www.instagram.com/dannymaude</a><br />○ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/dannymaudefan">https://www.facebook.com/dannymaudefan</a><br />○ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitter.com/dannymaude">https://www.twitter.com/dannymaude</a><br /><br />BOOK A GOLF LESSON<br />▶EMAIL: support@dannymaude.com<br />▶ Visit My Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dannymaude.com">https://dannymaude.com</a><br /><br />FREE TRAINING TO IMPROVE YOUR GAME<br />▶Add 25 yard driver course: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dannymaude.com/opt-in">https://www.dannymaude.com/opt-in</a><br />▶Join my weekly newsletter -<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dannymaude.com/p/newsletter-sign-up">https://dannymaude.com/p/newsletter-sign-up</a><br />▶ Join My YouTube Channel for Free - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSwdmDQhAi_-ICkAvNBLEBw?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSwdmDQhAi_-ICkAvNBLEBw?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />TRAINING AID I RECOMMEND - THE ORANGE WHIP<br />▶GOLFERS FROM THE US wanting to learn more about this weeks training aid just click the link below.  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://orangewhipgolf.com/discount/dannym?redirect=%2Fcollections%2Fall-products">https://orangewhipgolf.com/discount/dannym?redirect=%2Fcollections%2Fall-products</a><br />If you decide to purchase this will give you US $10 dollars off.  <br /><br />▶FOR ALL GOLFERS IN EUROPE - visit perfectmygolf.co.uk and use the discount code DANNY<br />#golftips #driverswingtips #dannymaudegolf<br /><br />-----------------------<br />ABOUT DANNY<br />-----------------------<br />Thanks for stopping by.  I created this website as a resource just for you to support you on your golfing journey as I know how tricky learning this game can be…to say the least!<br /><br />I personally found learning the game too long and difficult in the early days. I read all the books, watched all the videos but my game was not improving. Then after studying various forms of neuro science, motor learning, psychology and personal development in less than two years I went from struggling golfer to the final stage of the Open Championship.<br /><br />On YouTube and my personal website (www.dannymaude.com) I will bring you the most up to date training, training that is getting tangible results for my clients right now.  I don’t know where you are in your golfing journey, you could be just starting out or maybe your body isn’t as flexible as it once was or you’ve got ambitions to slash your handicap.  Wherever you are I’ve created a place here you can learn, share your ideas, ask questions and get all the support you need to enjoy this great game.<br /><br />Be prepared though. If its a quick fix you are after Im not your man. Here I will give you step-by-step advice that you can take straight to the practice ground and apply to the course but it will require you to get stuck in, screw up…a lot, practice some more and then watch those scores tumble<br /><br />I’ve had the pleasure of coaching thousands of students all around the world and if you are up for the challenge and are ready to get in the game…LETS GO TO WORK!<br /><br />This golf lesson provides a couple of wonderful drills to help you hit your driver straight.If you are a beginner golfer and are looking for some golf driver tips that are simple and easy to do then you are going to love this.<br /><br />I will show you the golf swing slow motion so that you can see what you need to do to improve.<br /><br />We look at 3 things:<br /><br />1. How to stop slicing your driver<br />2. How to swing more in to out or how to swing more inside out<br />3, How to get the correct impact position with driver<br /><br />and I hope to do all this with simple golf tips so you can create an effortless golf swing{% endraw %}
