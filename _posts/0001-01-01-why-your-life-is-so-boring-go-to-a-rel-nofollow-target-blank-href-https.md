Thanks to Squarespace for sponsoring this video ðŸ¤˜<br /><br />Letâ€™s face it. Your life is boring as f*ck. And hereâ€™s the biggest reason why... you havenâ€™t taken enough risks. Whether youâ€™re thinking about starting a YouTube channel, asking out that cute stranger across the bar, or moving across the world to your dream city, itâ€™s scary to take a leap into the unknown.<br /><br />But if you want to live a life filled with purpose, adventure and happiness, youâ€™re going to have to get really comfortable being uncomfortable. So in this video I talk about how you can push yourself further, take the right kind of risks and consistently embrace uncertainty in a way that feels right for you.<br /><br />Hi there ðŸ‘‹ If you're new to my video's my name is Matt D'Avella.
