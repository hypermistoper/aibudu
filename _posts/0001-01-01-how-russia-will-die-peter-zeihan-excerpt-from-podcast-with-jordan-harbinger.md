{% raw %}Excerpt from Podcast with Jordan Harbinger.<br />Listen to full interview...<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jordanharbinger.com/peter-zeihan-why-the-world-should-care-about-ukraine/">https://www.jordanharbinger.com/peter-zeihan-why-the-world-should-care-about-ukraine/</a><br /><br />On this episode, we discuss the developing situation with Peter Zeihan, a geopolitical strategist and author of The Absent Superpower, The Accidental Superpower, Disunited Nations, and the upcoming The End of the World is Just the Beginning: Mapping the Collapse of Globalization. <br /><br />Here, we examine how the current Russia-Ukraine conflict became a “now or never” option for Putin, the downsides for Russia if it “wins” and what we expect its next steps to be, what NATO is doing to avoid turning this into a nuclear-escalated World War III, why Putin’s actions leading up to this point in time don’t bode well for Russia in any scenario, and what a country like China with expansionist goals of its own might take away from Russia’s hard-earned lessons.{% endraw %}
