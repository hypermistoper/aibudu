{% raw %}Tank Master Yi continues to go on unpunished. But in all seriousness, I do actually really like this build especially into all AD comps. Its super fun and super good. I really recommend going tank in at least a few of your games. I'm going way more often than I thought.<br /><br />Enjoy full unedited games?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/cowsepgaming">https://youtube.com/cowsepgaming</a><br />Enjoy shorts?<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxBlVT-9_RnME_DMQ6ZU_KQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxBlVT-9_RnME_DMQ6ZU_KQ</a><br /><br />Cowsep lives in Korea and was an English teacher for 2 years.
