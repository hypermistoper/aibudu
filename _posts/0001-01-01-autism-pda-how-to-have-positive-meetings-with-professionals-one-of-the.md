{% raw %}One of the biggest challenges parents and carers face before, during, and after autism and PDA (Pathological Demand Avoidance), ADHD, Sensory Processing Disorder, and other neurodivergent diagnosis, is forging positive relationships with professionals. The diagnosis process, in particular, involves extensive interactions with professionals - from teachers, sencos, psychs to CAMHS, SALT (speech and language) and GPs. But often issues such as parent blame, lack of knowledge and understanding (issues such as masking) and a perceived apethy in a system stretched to its limits, can leave parents and carers feeling beaten and resentful. <br /><br />In this episode I look at the ways in which I've had to amend my approach when dealing with professionals in order to achieve positive results and gain the much needed support for my daughter's neurodivergence.<br /><br />LINKS <br />Why do we have to reach crisis to get support? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/dsedWPgtH_g">https://youtu.be/dsedWPgtH_g</a><br />Parent Blame <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/uHQCJRZNntw">https://youtu.be/uHQCJRZNntw</a><br />Masking <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/MTkZz5TWop8">https://youtu.be/MTkZz5TWop8</a><br /><br />#autism #PDA #diagnosis<br /><br />Connect with me on Social Media:<br />UK Autism Spectrum Parents Support Group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/ukaspsg/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/ukaspsg/</a><br />Twitter @pdadaduk <br />Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://m.facebook.com/PDADadUK/">https://m.facebook.com/PDADadUK/</a><br /><br />Watch My Recent Videos: <br />Across the Neurodivide Playlist <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdw7tvgLcirozLzv1GpyPychKl7rUJ1dg">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdw7tvgLcirozLzv1GpyPychKl7rUJ1dg</a><br />Tantrum or Meltdown? - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/NvkBnLmzg-g">https://youtu.be/NvkBnLmzg-g</a><br />Autism and PDA (Pathological Demand Avoidance) Life Hacks - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/NvkBnLmzg-g">https://youtu.be/NvkBnLmzg-g</a><br />Understand the role of dopamine in Autism and Pathological Demand Avoidance <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/R7EjyySdE6Y">https://youtu.be/R7EjyySdE6Y</a><br /><br />You may have heard of Autism, Pathological Demand Avoidance, and other associated neurodiversities, but do you actually understand what they are, and more importantly, WHO they are?<br />Autism., Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA), and other neurodiversities are, while widely known, sadly misunderstood. The purpose of this channel is to raise both autism acceptance and awareness by helping to educate with understanding and looking at all facets of autism such as Sensory Processing Disorder (SPD), ADHD, Mental Health, and other related topics.<br />I am a father to a beautiful autistic and Pathological Demand Avoidance (PDA) daughter. My channel is very personal and I'm very open about both the joys and challenges of life with a neurodiverse family and parenting Autism and Pathological Demand Avoidance. Thank you for watching!{% endraw %}
