{% raw %}Is conflict in the workplace inevitable? Yes. But should we be trying to avoid and resolve all conflict? No!<br /><br /><br /><br />Conflict comes from our differences in what we believe, how we think, and how we feel. It comes from differences in how we view ourselves and how we view the world.<br /><br /><br /><br />Healthy conflict is the &quot;secret sauce&quot; to making an exceptional company. Healthy conflict leads to great dialogue, new thinking, and better financial results.<br /><br /><br /><br />Unhealthy conflict leads to anger, bullying, disconnect, and silence. It leads to poor retention, burnout, and doing things &quot;the way they've always been done&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><br />So how do we make the transformation from unhealthy to healthy conflict and leverage conflict to our advantage?<br /><br /><br /><br />Join retired Chairman of Microsoft Europe / Olympic mental coach Jan Mühlfeit and top-rated CEO / Executive Coach Lisa Christen as they share their science-based approaches to making conflict a great tool for success in your team.<br /><br />See less{% endraw %}
