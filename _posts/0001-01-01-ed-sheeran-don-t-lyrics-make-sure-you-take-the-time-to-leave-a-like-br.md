{% raw %}Make sure you take the time to leave a like!<br /><br />Comment on what lyric video i should do!<br /><br />Ah lahmlahlah<br />Ah lahmlahlah<br /><br />[Verse 1:]<br />I met this girl late last year<br />She said, &quot;Don't you worry if I disappear.&quot;<br />I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake<br />I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait<br />But then I jump right in<br />A week later returned<br />I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn<br />But I gave her my time for two or three nights<br />Then I put it on pause 'til the moment was right<br />I went away for months until our paths crossed again<br />She told me, &quot;I was never looking for a friend.&quot;<br />Maybe you could swing by my room around 10:00<br />Baby, bring a lemon and a bottle of gin<br />We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM<br />Baby, if you wanted me then you should've just said<br />She's singing<br />Ah lahmlahlah<br /><br />[Chorus:]<br />Don't fuck with my love<br />That heart is so cold<br />All over my home<br />I don't wanna know that babe<br />Ah lahmlahlah<br />Don't fuck with my love<br />I told her she knows<br />Take aim and reload<br />I don't wanna know that babe<br />Ah lahmlahlah<br /><br />[Verse 2:]<br />For a couple weeks I<br />Only wanna see her<br />We drink away the days with a take-away pizza<br />Before a text message was the only way to reach her<br />Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her<br />Singing out Aretha<br />All over the track like a feature<br />And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either<br />But me and her we make money the same way<br />Four cities, two planes the same day<br />And those shows have never been what it's about<br />But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out<br />I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch<br />But we should get on a plane<br />Or we'll be missing it now<br />Wish I'd have written it down<br />The way that things played out<br />When she was kissing him<br />How? I was confused about<br />She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing<br />Ah lahmlahlah<br /><br />[Chorus:]<br />Don't fuck with my love<br />That heart is so cold<br />All over my home<br />I don't wanna know that babe<br />Ah lahmlahlah<br />Don't fuck with my love<br />I told her she knows<br />Take aim and reload<br />I don't wanna know that babe<br />Ah lahmlahlah<br /><br />[Verse 3:]<br />[Knock knock knock] on my hotel door<br />I don't even know if she knows what for<br />She was crying on my shoulder<br />I already told ya<br />Trust and respect is what we do this for<br />I never intended to be next<br />But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all<br />And I never saw him as a threat<br />Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course<br />It's not like we were both on tour<br />We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor<br />And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment<br />But it was never just fun and I thought you were different<br />This is not the way you realize what you wanted<br />It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest<br />All this time God knows I'm singing<br />Ah lahmlahlah<br /><br />[Chorus 2x:]<br />Don't fuck with my love<br />That heart is so cold<br />All over my home<br />I don't wanna know that babe<br />Ah lahmlahlah<br />Don't fuck with my love<br />I told her she knows<br />Take aim and reload<br />I don't wanna know that babe<br />Ah lahmlahlah<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE!{% endraw %}
