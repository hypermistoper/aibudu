No matter the depictions, the stories all tell of an advanced people that guided humanity into civilization. We see signs of their influence with the spontaneous rise of agriculture, architecture, and animal husbandry. As we examine the clues left behind, we see signs of these people in South America, New Zealand, and Egypt.<br /><br />&quot;WHAT IS GAIA?&quot; - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gaia.com/phenomena_mag">https://www.gaia.com/phenomena_mag</a> - follow the link to explore the largest resource of consciousness expanding video library in the world, featuring Topics that Go Beyond the Mainstream Media<br /><br /> &quot;WHAT KIND OF MOVIES DOES GAIA HAVE?&quot; - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gaia.com/phenomena_films">https://www.gaia.com/phenomena_films</a> - follow the link to fuel your spiritual conscious evolution with spiritual films and documentaries on Gaia<br /><br /> &quot;WHAT KIND OF TV SHOWS DOES GAIA HAVE?&quot; - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gaia.com/phenomena_tv">https://www.gaia.com/phenomena_tv</a> - follow the link to explore over 8,000+ Videos: Original Series, Films, Documentaries and Yoga Classes<br /><br />All content on this channel is licensed, and or produced by Zohar Entertainment Group/Awakening Expo/Phenomena Magazine{% endraw %}
