{% raw %}Shorting an assets is the most RISKY endeavor in the financial world because you are subjecting yourself to UNLIMITED LOSSES! You can not only lose your investment but EVERYTHING YOU HAVE IN LIFE AND MORE! That's because every short has a legal obligation to buy that short back in the future no matter what the price! Shorting should be banned from all markets...but it's not. Imagine how the Bank of America silver traders and risk department are feeling with a 800M+ ounces silver short position and NO SELLERS at ANY PRICE to close out their trade! BofA's Silver Short will be the TRIGGER for Mass Financial Destruction!{% endraw %}
