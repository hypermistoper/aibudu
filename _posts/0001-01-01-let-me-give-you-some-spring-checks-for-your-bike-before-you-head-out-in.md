{% raw %}In this short, I'm giving you a brief list of checks to make on your bike before you take your bike out for the first time after it's been locked away in the garage for the last several months.<br />They are, Brakes, Tyres, Chain, Electrics (inc lights), General Damage, then take it easily on your first ride until your skills return.{% endraw %}
