{% raw %}In this video I wanted to show how America's founding fathers might have looked in real life. I used my own artistic interpretations for each of the renderings. Everything is just my opinion. I sued After Effects, Photoshop, and Cinema 4d to transform and add animations to the new renderings. Of course all the renderings are just my own opinion.<br /><br />In this video we have: George Washington, John Adams, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, Benjamin Franklin, James Monroe, John Jay, and Samuel Adams<br /><br />See George Washington when he was younger: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/EI5qDafHunY">https://youtu.be/EI5qDafHunY</a><br />MARTHA WASHINGTON'S VIDEO:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/rV0LVwc2nZM">https://youtu.be/rV0LVwc2nZM</a><br /><br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br />Subscribe for more recreations!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLkN9aa7m2J4PKtSTs4DrlQ">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLkN9aa7m2J4PKtSTs4DrlQ</a><br /><br /><br />#MortalFaces  #GeorgeWashington #FoundingFathers{% endraw %}
