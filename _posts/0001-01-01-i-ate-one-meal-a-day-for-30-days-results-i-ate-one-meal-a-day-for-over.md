{% raw %}I ate one meal a day for over 30 days so here are my results. Learn what to expect with an omad diet meal plan. Eating one meal a day is a form of intermittent fasting for weight loss.

Would you lose weight and more specifically would you lose body fat or would you lose muscle mass? Or maybe your body would go into starvation mode and cause you to gain weight rather than lose it due to a slower metabolism? Well that's exactly what we're going to drive into in today's video. I've been eating one meal a day not every day but almost everyday for about 2 years now. And it's worked really well for me, so today I'd like to let you guys know what results you can expect if you stick to only one meal day for the next 30 days. Even though I've had quite a bit of experience with the one meal a day diet myself I'm going to be sharing scientific studies and evidence that will help you see both the pros and the cons of this diet approach. First I want to go over the proper way to set up this diet plan for yourself because there's not an abundance of information out there on the one meal a day diet like there is on shorter fasting protocols like intermittent fasting. So a lot of people that try to stick to this diet plan mess it up from the very get go and turn it into more of a warrior diet. And the warrior diet is great, but that's not what we're going for here. You see the warrior diet is a different form of fasting where you fast for 20 hours of the day and you give yourself a four hour feeding window for eating. If you don't set limits to the amount of time you spend eating you easily can drag out your one single meal into a buffet that lasts for hours. So it's very important that you understand that one meal a day is also a 23/1 fasting to feeding split. Meaning you only give yourself a 1 hour feeding window usually during the same time every day and you have to spend the other 23 hours of the day fasting. If it isn't already obvious OMad or the one meal a day diet helps you create a calorie deficit without really thinking about restricting calories. When you're only eating once a day especially when you do it the right way and limit it to under an hour, you can only fit so much into your stomach before your full. So really we're limiting calories by decreasing meal frequency. Which immediately can be a red flag for those people that believe that your metabolism slows down when you decrease meal frequency. However, numerous studies have proven this to be a myth. One study called &quot;meal frequency and energy balance&quot; combined and examined research from a bunch of different studies on the topic of meal frequency. And the researchers found that a nibbling pattern of eating or eating more frequently didn't present any advantage as far as the metabolic rate was concerned. So your metabolism is not going to automatically slow down from eating only one meal a day for 30 days. If you have the same amount of calories in that one meal as you would in 6 meals then your metabolism should remain the same in both situations. So does that mean that the &quot;starvation mode&quot; that we've all been warned about is a big phony scam? Well turns out it's actually not, it's actually called adaptive thermogenesis and it's a very real response that your body has. In response to a decrease in energy intake your body will decrease energy expenditure in an effort to avoid starvation. However adaptive thermogenesis will occur based on the total amount of energy or calories coming in. As long as you don't fast for over 48 hours It doesn't matter...<br /><br />Research:<br />Meal frequency does not accelerate or slow your metabolism:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9155494">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9155494</a>   <br /><br />Effects of meal frequency on weight loss and body composition (meta-analysis):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26024494">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26024494</a><br /><br />3 meals per day vs 6 meals a day does not effect weight loss:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19943985">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19943985</a><br /><br />Resting Metabolism Increase from Short term fasting: ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10837292 <br /><br />Metabolic response to a 48 hour starvation:<br />ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2405717<br /><br />One meal a day vs three meals per day for 6 months:<br />ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2121099/<br />ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2645638/{% endraw %}
