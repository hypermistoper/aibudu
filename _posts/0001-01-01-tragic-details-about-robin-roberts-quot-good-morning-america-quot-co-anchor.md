{% raw %}&quot;Good Morning America&quot; co-anchor Robin Roberts has made no secret of her personal struggles over the years. She has endured two different types of cancer very publicly, and shared her grief about the deaths of her parents with the world. It's hard to forget when she cried on-air when Hurricane Katrina hit her hometown.<br /><br />Roberts' openness to share these tragedies, as well as her joys, has created a connection with audiences few other TV news personalities have. Yet she hasn't been entirely public with everything, including some behind-the-scenes conflicts at ABC, one even with an on-air colleague. These are tragic details about Robin Roberts.<br /><br />#RobinRoberts #Anchor #TVNews<br /><br />Cancer diagnosis | 0:00<br />Devastating news | 1:23<br />Tragic death of mother | 2:46<br />Faced racism at work | 3:51<br />Beef with George Stephanopoulos? | 4:57<br />Father's sudden death | 6:10<br />Hometown's destruction | 7:11<br />Unfulfilled dreams | 8:24<br /><br />Read Full Article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.nickiswift.com/759416/tragic-details-about-robin-roberts/">https://www.nickiswift.com/759416/tragic-details-about-robin-roberts/</a>{% endraw %}
