{% raw %}Leave no Trace or Minimal Impact Bushwalking and Hiking, is all about leaving our wonderful natural places in the best way we can when spending time in the bush. Taking all our rubbish with us is just the beginning and the great news is that all these concepts of minimal impact are super easy to follow. It means that we are leaving our national parks the way we'd like to find them and helping to protect them from further damage. In this short video, I run through not just the physical tips of what to do but also think about some of the other ways we can minimise our impact both socially, culturally and continue to love these wild places for a very long time to come.<br />#Leavenotrace #lnt #hiking #MinimalImpactBushwalking #bushwalking<br /><br />ðŸ”´  SUBSCRIBEâ–¸ Don't miss out on fresh videos! â–¸ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=Lotsafreshair">https://youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=Lotsafreshair</a><br /><br />ðŸ“¸  INSTAGRAMâ–¸ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lotsafreshair/">https://www.instagram.com/lotsafreshair/</a><br />ðŸ–¼  FACEBOOKâ–¸ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/lotsafreshair">https://www.facebook.com/lotsafreshair</a><br /><br />PLEASE SUPPORT MY CHANNEL and buy me a coffee!<br />â˜•  KO-FIâ–¸ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/lotsafreshair">https://ko-fi.com/lotsafreshair</a><br /><br />ðŸ“š  buy HOW TO NAVIGATE - The art of traditional map and compass navigation in an Australian contextâ–¸ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lotsafreshair.com/2021/01/30/how-to-navigate/">https://lotsafreshair.com/2021/01/30/how-to-navigate/</a><br /><br />ðŸ“¥ GET YOUR FREE PACKING LIST DOWNLOADS AND LOADS OF HIKING RESOURCES<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://lotsafreshair.com/">https://lotsafreshair.com/</a><br /><br />About Caroâ–¸<br />I grew up in Sydney, Australia in a family that never went camping or on outdoor adventures. So it came as a surprise to discover hiking and camping in my mid 20â€™s and it fast became somewhat of an obsession.<br /><br />Since then, Iâ€™ve become a leader with the Sydney Bush Walkers Club, Search Manager with NSW SES Bush Search and Rescue (responsible for the Blue Mountains region), navigation teacher and author of 'How to Navigate - The art of traditional map and compass navigation in an Australian context.'<br /><br />I'm passionate about connecting people to wild places in meaningful ways.<br /><br />Apart from sharing tips here on my YouTube channel, my website and socials, you can find me as a regular contributor to Wild Magazine, Great Walks Magazines and other outdoors press. You might even catch me live on ABC radio Weekends with Simon Marnie and appearing as a speaker and workshop host at events such as Bushwalking Australia Conferences, ProBlogger, ORIC (Outdoor Recreation Industry) Conference, SheWentWild or the Womenâ€™s Adventure Summit. I am a member of the ASTW (Australian Society of Travel Writers) and you can also find me on TravMedia.<br /><br />I am a brand ambassador for Macpac and some of the links within my site are affiliates. This means that I may earn a small commission from what you may purchase, whilst you pay no more. A nice win-win way of supporting my work that I really appreciate. Thanks! <br /><br />Brands may buy my time, but they can't buy my opinion.{% endraw %}
