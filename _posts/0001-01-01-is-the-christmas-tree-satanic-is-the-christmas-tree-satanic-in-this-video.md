{% raw %}Is the Christmas Tree Satanic? - In this video I address the question of whether the modern day Christmas Tree is a symbol meant to glorify Satan. Primarily I rely on the Bible as a tool to interpret the symbol that is the Christmas Tree. I also provide several historical observations as I go to help bolster my case. Ultimately, it's between each individual person and God whether they choose to use a Christmas Tree or not. However, I do hope this video will help the individual make an educated and Biblical decision in the matter.<br /><br />Become a Patron of Theophilus Most Excellent here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheophilusMostExcellent">https://www.patreon.com/TheophilusMostExcellent</a><br /><br />As a side note, I encourage my Christian brothers who are interested to examine my Playlists section here on YouTube:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClh6ABQPVkU3N1fD7jb_6yA/playlists">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClh6ABQPVkU3N1fD7jb_6yA/playlists</a><br /><br />I have put together a lot of good material for the believing Christian, esp. the newborn Christian, categorizing it all the best I could. There is quite a lot of good material available, ranging from apologetics, which is reasons for faith and answers to difficulties regarding faith, to Biblical teaching, to in-depth examinations of various other worldviews, as well as videos exposing satanic teachings/teachers, occultism, New World Order/Illuminati type things and many many others.<br /><br />I hope the video edifies and builds up the Church of Christ.

I love all of you very much and I hope you're blessed in the Lord.<br /><br />Godspeed,<br />Theophilus<br /><br />Music Credits:<br />Jingle Bells Calm by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a> <br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100187">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100187</a> <br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a> <br /><br />Mermaid by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</a> <br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100671">http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100671</a> <br />Artist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://incompetech.com/">http://incompetech.com/</a>{% endraw %}
