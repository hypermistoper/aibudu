{% raw %}Our methods and practices move us closer toward rebirth and enlightenment. Ram Dass stresses that a yogi has to become vulnerable to find patience and joy on the road to higher consciousness. They must let go of the external noise to return to a childlike state. “The desire to rush enlightenment is a desire you have to give up”. When a being reaches enlightenment, all of the social forms and mind trips it has used in the past become archaic. Though it may seem frightening, enlightened beings often have much less to communicate about, as the material world has fallen away.  Enlightened yogis realize that other beings are not defined by their differences, but rather by their similarities in the divine mother.{% endraw %}
