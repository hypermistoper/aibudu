Not exercising your brain <br />The way you live can actually have a huge impact on your brain health.<br /><br />2. Poor diet <br />You literally lose everything when your memory goes. Dementia can interfere with your decision-making, thinking, and social abilities too.<br /><br />3. Not getting enough sleep <br />When was the last time you clocked a good 8-9 hours of sleep and woke up feeling refreshed? Deep sleep can be the ultimate power cleanse for your brain.<br /><br />4. Leading a sedentary life <br />Are you one of those people who won't run until they're being chased? Chances are you might develop a higher risk of dementia. It may start with simple things like forgetting where you put your keys and advance to a degree where you no longer recognize your loved ones.<br /><br />5. You had a brain injury in your past <br />Any head injury in the past should be thoroughly checked. If you are prone to injuries, get your house re-furnished.<br /><br />6. You are drinking too much of alcohol <br />Are you heading out for a cocktail party tonight? Just hear us out before you go all out on the booze.<br /><br />7. You are socially isolated <br />Humans are social animals and being around your people can put you in a better mood. Some socially engaging activities can also support brain health. <br /><br />8. Youâ€™re Not Visiting a Doctor or taking care of yourself. <br />Thereâ€™s a lot to know when it comes to dementia, and we donâ€™t have it totally figured out yet. But one proactive way you can stay ahead of it is if youâ€™re going to the doctor when you need to and staying up with all your medication and health needs. <br /><br />For more information, please watch the video until the very end.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Subscribe to Bestie : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/tUqro6">https://goo.gl/tUqro6</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/">https://www.facebook.com/bestieinc/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/bestiehealth/">https://www.instagram.com/bestiehealth/</a>{% endraw %}
