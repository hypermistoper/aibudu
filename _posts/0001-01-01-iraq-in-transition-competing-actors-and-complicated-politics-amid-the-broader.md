{% raw %}Amid the broader challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Iraq is seeking to establish a new government. The recently appointed Prime Minister, Mustafa al-Khadimi, faces a litany of domestic issues ranging from a serious economic downturn; on-going protests about endemic corruption; and broader concerns about the latent Islamic State threat.<br /><br />To discuss these issues, the Foreign Policy Research Institute and the DT Institute are hosting a virtual Iraq briefing with Dr. Renad Mansour, a senior research fellow, and project director of the Iraq Initiative at Chatham House, and Ms. Inna Rudolf, a Research Fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR).<br /><br />The panel will be jointly moderated by Dr. Aaron Stein, Director of FPRIâ€™s Middle East Program, and Mr. John DeBlasio, the Chairman of DT Global and DT Institute.{% endraw %}
