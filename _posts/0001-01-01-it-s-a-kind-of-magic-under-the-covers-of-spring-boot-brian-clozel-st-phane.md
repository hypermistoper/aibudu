{% raw %}One of Spring Boot's most powerful features is its auto-configuration. This magic is key to the convention-over-configuration approach that has brought a huge boost in productivity to Java developers. But is it really magic? We don't think so.<br /><br />In this session we'll take a look under the covers of Spring Boot. You'll learn about auto-configuration and the conditional configuration model that powers it, helping you to be even more productive when writing Spring Boot applications.<br /><br />Brian Clozel, Spring Team Member,  Pivotal<br />Stéphane Nicoll, Spring Developer, Pivotal<br />Filmed at SpringOne Platform 2017{% endraw %}
