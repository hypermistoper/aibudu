{% raw %}For copyright matters, please contact us at: official.lt1y@gmail.com<br /><br />Most of us can’t live without their mobile phones. Majority of the population have it with them 24/7. Nowadays, you can not only communicate using them, but you can now also take videos, photos, and more! Phone’s can pretty much do anything now! Because of this, we can snap a photo or take a video anytime we want and upload it on the internet. We can even stream in real time! There are now countless videos on the internet, and some of them are things that are too bizarre, weird, or terrifying to watch. From levitating girl to Crocodile Close Call, here are 15 times when a phone captured what no one was supposed to see.  <br /><br />~ Top Generality{% endraw %}
