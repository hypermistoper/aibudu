Scientists have been working on solving these mysteries hundred years ago but through the access of telescopes that they had on Earth, Now years later, many space telescopes have been made and launched that have helped the scientists in proving many things those early scientists had theorized Now, with the billion dollar James Webb Space Telescope in space, the astronomers are curious to confirm these theories. One such theory, that is a major part of Physics, the general theory of relativity. But how is James Webb going to solve it? Is it going to prove any specific field? What actually is this theory and why the James webb!<br />Welcome to Cosmos Lab. Your one station for all the news from space. Join us in today’s video to find out about Einstein’s general theory of relativity and will the James Webb Space Telescope be able to prove it.<br />The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has arrived at its final destination after a month-long voyage. Now that the telescope is cooling down and deploying instruments, it won't be long before it begins reporting back with results and intriguing new imagery. NASA's new and enhanced space observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope's replacement, has numerous goals in mind for its mission into space. It will not only be used to learn more about the Milky Way, but it will also look for distant exoplanets and celestial objects, as well as search for signs of dark matter.<br />On Christmas 2021, the infrared space observatory launched from ESA's launch facility in Kourou, French Guiana, aboard an Arianespace Ariane 5 rocket. After launch, it traveled over a million miles (1.5 million kilometers) to its permanent home, a Lagrange point, which is a gravitationally stable location in space. At the second Lagrange point, the James Webb Space Telescope will orbit the sun. L2 is a point in space near Earth that is opposite the sun; this orbit keeps the telescope aligned with Earth as it orbits the sun. Several other space telescopes, like the Herschel Space Telescope and the Planck Space Observatory, have utilized it. Webb may take relatively little fuel to stay in position if it reaches the right zone due to its near-perfect alignment with the sun, Earth, and moon.{% endraw %}
