Earth revolves around the Sun,  and by the way, so do all the other planets in our Solar System - and there's more of them than we all thought.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;This is heresy!  We'll have you hung in chains for this!&quot; the learned gentlemen, noble lords, and clergymen cried.<br /><br />&quot;You have the power to do so, though it's always puzzled me, what force acts on my body to make being hung in chains so painful,&quot; replied the heretic.<br /><br />They all had to wait for Sir Isaac Newton's explanation for that mystery.<br /><br />Eventually, the Church, the scientists, and everyone else agreed, albeit somewhat reluctantly, that the heretic had been right all along.<br /><br />However, a generally unspoken agreement persisted.<br /><br />This was the idea that the human race was superior to all life on Earth, and that Earth was the centre of the Universe.<br /><br />Perhaps not in a literal sense, they thought, conceding a point to the heretic, but metaphorically speaking.<br /><br />This time it was not only the scientists but also the science fiction writers and the general public who argued against this arrogance.<br /><br />&quot;Look,&quot;, they said, &quot;here's us, here's our solar system, and here is our galaxy.  There are billions of stars in each galaxy, and billions of galaxies.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Not only that, but the Universe is expanding, and it's all been going on for a long, long time.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;So if we're here, fannying around with our rudimentary technology after a few thousand years, imagine how far life might have evolved on other planets.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Imagine if another civilisation had managed to work out that war was indeed good for absolutely nothing.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And imagine if they'd also realised that polluting their world and depleting all its natural resources was the quickest way to oblivion.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;And just imagine if they'd managed to crack the conundrum of interstellar travel, and dropped by now and then to see what sort of mess we're making of Planet Earth.&quot;<br /><br />One of Arthur C. Clarke's most frequently repeated quotes, and the third of what's become known as Clarke's three laws, is, &quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&quot;<br /><br />Let's now imagine we've travelled back in time a mere 400 years to Stuart England, carrying with us our smartphones and tablets.<br /><br />We present ourselves to the most open minded and best educated people we can find and try explain how these handheld devices work and what they do.<br /><br />We show them the apps, how to send an email or browse the web, and of course, how to take selfies.<br /><br />Continued in the video...<br /><br />###<br /><br />My Secrets Revealed:<br />I film footage using these products: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/fkbWgN">https://goo.gl/fkbWgN</a><br />I optimise these videos using TubeBuddy: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ow.ly/x7yH30qRlhU">http://ow.ly/x7yH30qRlhU</a><br /><br />Capture video footage on the go with the Osmo Pocket: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ow.ly/xWHM30od87p">http://ow.ly/xWHM30od87p</a><br /><br /><br />Consider leaving a tip: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/redspan">https://paypal.me/redspan</a><br />Bespoke videos made for you: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/22u4R6">https://goo.gl/22u4R6</a><br /><br />My YouTube Channel Information:<br />Subscribe to my channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/FhzGmn">https://goo.gl/FhzGmn</a><br />My most recent upload:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/ujZ7ms">https://goo.gl/ujZ7ms</a><br />My most popular upload: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/ThKf7y">https://goo.gl/ThKf7y</a><br /><br />My Playlists:<br />Flight Training, Private &amp; Commercial Pilot: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/EuD7wt">https://goo.gl/EuD7wt</a><br />Learn To Fly, Get Your Pilot's Licence: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/6Z6h6P">https://goo.gl/6Z6h6P</a><br />General Aviation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/p8MLZY">https://goo.gl/p8MLZY</a><br />Aviation Careers: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/bhZWXL">https://goo.gl/bhZWXL</a><br />Career Training &amp; Business Tools: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rh9P46">https://goo.gl/rh9P46</a><br /><br />My Social Media Links:<br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BensBookmarks">https://twitter.com/BensBookmarks</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ben_lovegrove_aero">https://www.instagram.com/ben_lovegrove_aero</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/redspansolutions/">https://www.facebook.com/redspansolutions/</a><br />Google+: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://google.com/+BenLovegrove">https://google.com/+BenLovegrove</a><br />###<br /><br />Acknowledgements:<br />This presentation contains images that were used under a Creative Commons License.
