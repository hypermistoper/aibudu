{% raw %}It's taken me years to improve my craft of coaching, it's not something that happens overnight or by accident. I never had a mentor to help me with coaching, that was until I signed up for the NCFIT Collective's programming. I evolved into a better coach by reading and watching the briefs everyday (including the days I wasn't coaching), and taking notes of my own and reviewing them the morning of class.<br /><br />Yup it's more work, but man oh man does it show during class. <br /><br />Haven't subscribed? Want to watch our gym go from almost failing to succeeding? We would love to have you along for the ride! <br /><br />Check out our Facebook Page: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/HaywardCrossFit">https://www.facebook.com/HaywardCrossFit</a><br /><br />Instagram:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/crossfit_fairwaypark/">https://www.instagram.com/crossfit_fairwaypark/</a><br /><br />Website:<br />www.FairwayParkCrossFit.com<br /><br />#Fitness #CrossFit #BestHourOfTheirDay #CrossFitAffiliate{% endraw %}
