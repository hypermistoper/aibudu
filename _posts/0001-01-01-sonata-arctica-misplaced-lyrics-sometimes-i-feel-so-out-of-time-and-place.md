{% raw %}Sometimes I feel so out of time and place, trapped in a maze<br />As if I was lost in someone else's life...<br />The values I should keep in high regard don't mean a thing to me<br /><br />Do you ever feel a need to go back in time? A dream of mine...<br />To travel far away and one day steal back my life<br />In the end all I can do is to learn I live in a dreamland<br /><br />This time was not made for me,<br />I have nowhere to land, no place to rest,<br />Like a bird, without a nest, I'm gliding<br />Under the clouds, forevermore<br /><br />How much suffocated anxiety can be held within?<br />I was found guilty to a crime against myself.<br />No need to hear the words again,<br />I live and I'd die for my dreamland<br /><br />This time was not made for me<br />I have nowhere to land, no place to rest,<br />Like a bird, without a nest, I'm gliding<br />Under the clouds, forevermore<br /><br />I'll never have a chance, I can't understand<br />I'm a misplaced man<br />How could this backward land<br />Learn to understand my dance<br />what it's like, when every single smile hurts...<br /><br />I have never felt like home here<br />Always missing something<br />People aren't connecting<br />Am I a misplaced soul?<br /><br />I live in a perfect Hell, I try finding my wishing well<br />when I drop my last tear, I have accepted this life<br /><br />A true saint, that I am not, you have never seen me<br />'Cause I have always been there, standing by your side<br /><br />I'll never have a chance, I can't understand<br />I'm a misplaced man<br />How could this backward land<br />Learn to understand my dance<br />what it's like, when...<br /><br />Every single moment pains me...<br />Never felt like home here<br />I am missing something<br />My soul's in a wrong shell?{% endraw %}
