{% raw %}I don't know how many dirt bikes we have ridden out of the dealership but it never gets old! This 2022 Honda 250 looks so good I want to keep it for myself to ride but I'm going to give it away to you guys! It's always a fun time ripping laps with Medium and Politelli especially when we get 450s and 110s in the same day. Thank you to everyone who watches and supports us we truly appreciate you guys!
