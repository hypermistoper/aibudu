{% raw %}Harvard Lawâ€™s first deafblind graduate, Haben Girma, excelled in large part because people created accessible technology. Haben, who works at Disability Rights Advocates, encourages the development of accessible services and products. Recognized as a Champion of Change by the White House, Haben moves us towards a world where people with disabilities access the same services, on the same devices, and at the same time as non-disabled consumers. Technology designed with accessibility in mind truly transforms the lives of people with disabilities. Through this thoughtful discussion, Haben invites everyone to design products from the ground up with universal access in mind. To learn more about Haben, visit habengirma.com.
