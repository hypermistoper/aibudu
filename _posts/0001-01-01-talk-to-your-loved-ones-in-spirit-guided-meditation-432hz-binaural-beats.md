{% raw %}This Guided Meditation will offer you the support and guidance to talk to your loved ones who are now in spirit by becoming your own medium, receiving messages, blessings, and any gifts they may wish to impart. You will have the opportunity to ask any questions or clear up any misunderstandings you may have had with them prior to their death. The more you practice this guided meditation the easier it will become to establish a connection with those in spirit, giving you an opportunity to release any heavy emotions that may have been a weight on your heart such as sadness, pain, loss, or regret by being a kind and compassionate witness...working with all aspects of your emotions. And when you are ready, release them into the light of love and peace to be transformed and healed. <br /><br />Our minds can understand many things but it is with our hearts that we grieve and work with our grief, feeling that sorrow and ache all the way through our bones to our own spirits. Grieving is a very normal and healthy part of the human experience that holds no frame of time, refuses to be contained and must be invited, honored and allowed a seat at the table in it‚Äôs full expression. Death reveals the meaning of our existence and reminds us of just how precious our life is. Peaceful sleep to follow due to extended audio with 432Hz binaural beats. <br /><br />With any new skill that you are learning, each time you practice your experiences will build on itself bringing about more awareness, insights, understanding and confidence.<br /><br />Peace, Love and Kindest Regards, <br />Connie üíû<br /><br />‚ú® If you enjoyed this audio experience, please consider sharing and liking this video üëçüèº and commenting to let us know.
