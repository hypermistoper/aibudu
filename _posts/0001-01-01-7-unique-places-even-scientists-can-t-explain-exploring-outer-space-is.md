One side has water falling into another body of water, Lake Superior; the other one has water that falls straight into a huge natural hole in the ground. Where does this water lead? No one seems to know!<br />- While today we have machines that can help us lift heavy materials to build giant buildings and monuments, back in the days when Stonehenge was built, no one had access to this type of technology.<br />- In Hessdalen Valley, brightly colored lights appear in the sky in different colors and shapes. For the last 4 decades (and possibly longer!), this phenomenon has continued to puzzle scientists.<br />- Deep in the Amazon rainforests lies a flowing river in the forested region of Mayantuyacu that boasts temperatures so hot that any person or animal that falls into it literally boils alive from the inside out.<br />- Movile Cave, located in Southeastern Romania, remained closed in complete darkness for a whopping 5.5 million years! Scientists carved out an opening to the cave and found that a completely sustained ecosystem was thriving inside!<br />- Circles of Namibia are almost perfect and range anywhere from 10 to 65 ft in diameter. Many scientists have offered up theories as to why these circles appear instead of other more random shapes.<br />- But in Western Venezuela, over the mouth of the Catatumbo River, there’s a lightning storm that seems to be running on Energizer batteries — it just keeps going and going! Once the clock strikes 7 PM, the lightning storm begins and doesn’t relent for another 10 long hours. <br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br /><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Photos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br />East News<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
