{% raw %}In today's video, we are going to ask a very difficult question: “Is it possible that those who operate within healthcare organisations which give honour to the serpent on the pole, the Rod of Asclepius, are among the 'many' who deceive the many by claiming to be 'the Christ?'”<br /><br />Pharmakeia is the use and administration of drugs for the purposes of deceiving people and seducing them into idolatry of other people and of false gods. The ultimate purpose of this form of witchcraft and sorcery is to entice people into worshipping that ancient serpent, Satan. Pharmakeia has, unfortunately, blinded the spiritual eyes of many who declare that Jesus is the Christ, causing them instead, to follow the spirit of antichrist in the endtimes just before His Second Coming .<br /><br />Does the Bible really teach us that God's gives mankind wisdom in order to “save lives.” Does John 3:16 say that 'God so loved the world that He gave mankind wisdom so that those who go to their doctors and obey all of their instructions and who take all of their prescribed drugs should not die but should live to a ripe old age?' Or is this a false gospel leading to a false Cristos operating under an antichrist spirit?{% endraw %}
