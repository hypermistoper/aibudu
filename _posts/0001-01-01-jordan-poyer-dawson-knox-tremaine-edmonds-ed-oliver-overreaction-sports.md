{% raw %}Set your reminders and join Joe Miller for the Overreaction Sports Show as we get into the realities that are coming when we consider who the BILLS can keep and resign in the next couple years and the ones they can't. If you are forced to make a decision between Poyer, Oliver, Knox and Edmunds, who are you choosing? While we have see Beane work magic, baring an overwhelming player decision to not chase the money, the BILLS are assured to lose at least one if not two of these players. So who is it? Who stays? Who has to chase his dreams in another city?<br /><br /><br /><br />Join Joe LIVE at 8pm to find out if he is overreacting or not!<br /><br /><br /><br />Subscribe to the Buffalo Rumblings podcast channel featuring Billieve, Buffalo Rumblings Q&amp;A, Breaking Buffalo Rumblings, Code of Conduct with J.
