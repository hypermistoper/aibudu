{% raw %}IndyCar Gordon - 6.3.22.<br /><br />Neil Oliver attempts to suggest that because in Skara Brae neolithic home is similar to a dwelling near Stonehenge, that a Great British culture, predates the establishment of Scotland and England. <br /><br />Making the facts fit his unionist viewpoint that there always was a &quot;British&quot; culture.<br /><br />One dwelling does not make Britain an entity in the stone age. Even if it did, that would have no bearing on modern political reality.<br /><br />This is similar ideological thinking to what Putin is trying to assert by invading and destroying Ukraine.{% endraw %}
