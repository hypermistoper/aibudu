{% raw %}EMBRACING DIFFERENCES  <br /><br />We may have....<br />different religions, traditions or cultures......<br />diverse languages,  ethnicity or coloured skin, <br />or even varied abilities, <br />personalities and perspectives,<br />but we all belong to one human race. <br /><br />The words above, though inspired by Kofi Annan...<br />but the concept of this short film however that you're watching now, <br />has been entirely created out of my feelings through my personal experiences, <br />and executed with the help of mostly royalty free stock videos available online <br />to which i'm greatly thankful üôè<br />though due to limited time i couldn‚Äôt express and expand my vision the way I really wanted, <br />So all I did was to somehow present ‚Äúdifferences‚Äù in its most creative form with all that i was left with, in approx a week's time...<br />So Would really appreciate your love, support and most importantly your feedback !<br /><br />To know more,<br />Check me out on my social.....<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/gazellivoire">https://www.facebook.com/gazellivoire</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/gazellivoire">http://instagram.com/gazellivoire</a><br /><br />Much Love !<br /><br />#Gazellivoire{% endraw %}
