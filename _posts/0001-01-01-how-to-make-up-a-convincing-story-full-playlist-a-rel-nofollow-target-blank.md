It only takes a few steps to spin a convincing yarn.<br /><br />Step 1: Devise the plot<br />Map out the basic plot before you start to ensure you create a logical story. Make your tale's beginning strong and realistic -- audiences often believe the first messages they encounter.<br /><br />Step 2: Simplify situations<br />Repeat the story's central conflict often to maintain focus -- audiences are more likely to suspend disbelief for a plot they can follow.<br /><br />Step 3: Create characters<br />Create characters that act consistently to help satisfy the expectations you create for the audience. Include a hero with clear motivations whom the audience can easily identify with and root for.<br /><br />Tip<br />Give your hero flaws to make identifying with them even easier -- perfection isn't believable.<br /><br />Step 4: Add details<br />Incorporate details about settings, times, and emotions into your story to create context for the action. Make sure to get specifics right -- it's hard to convince an audience it was a snowing if your story's set in the desert.<br /><br />Step 5: Finish it off<br />Tie up loose ends to leave the audience feeling satisfied -- not only will they be more likely to believe you now, they'll be more inclined to trust you if you need to make up a convincing story in the future.<br /><br />Did You Know?<br />In 1830, Edward Bulwer-Lytton's published the novel Paul Clifford with the famous opening line, &quot;It was a dark and stormy night.&quot;{% endraw %}
