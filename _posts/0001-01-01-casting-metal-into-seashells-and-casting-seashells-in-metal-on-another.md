{% raw %}On another channel, linked below, I saw some interesting experimentation with pouring metal inside seashells to reveal the internal structure.  I thought I might try a bit of this myself, but also in a way that allows me to cast both the inside and outside of the shell form.<br /><br />Here's the video that inspired me: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umef9gU6O5E">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=umef9gU6O5E</a><br /><br />Also, I'm grateful for Robert Tolone's enormous expertise on silicone casting.  Take a look at his channel if you want to see it done properly! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM0fEZEprxY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gM0fEZEprxY</a><br /><br />Part 2 of this series (making something with actual utility) is coming on Friday 15th April...{% endraw %}
