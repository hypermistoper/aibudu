{% raw %}We`ve created this video to show you guys the amazing Daikin HT unit.<br />It`s so stylish and quiet, and looks great in any garden.<br />It`s also registered for RHI payments at 65dc to the radiators system.<br />We`ve also linked the Daikin HT to the Mixergy Hot Water Tank, the Mixergy tank allows any heat pump system to connect through a plate heat exchanger at the bottom of the tank.<br />The customer`s existing Solar PV system sends spare energy through the  Solic PV diverter, and charges the immersion heater at the top of the tank, the built in pump on the Mixergy tank pulls water from the very bottom of the tank, and sprays it over the immersion heater, therefore heating the hot water 5 times faster than a standard hot water cylinder.<br />if you would like more information of both of these products, please visit our website: www.ecobubl.co.uk email: sales@ecobubl.co.uk Tel: 01985 208209{% endraw %}
