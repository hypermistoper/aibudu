{% raw %}On a relative basis, &quot;the U.S. dollar has started to rise, and for various reasons that causes a lot of problems,&quot; asserts Brent Johnson, Santiago Capital Founder, and CEO. He tells our Daniela Cambone that the dollar's trajectory, &quot;will eventually lead to a currency crisis, and we may be in the early stages of that now.&quot; Central banks around the world are in a similar situation to the Bank of Japan by wading pressures from a strong dollar, Johnson states. The BOJ is really stuck, &quot;they need to raise rates in order to protect their currency, but they can't raise rates because then you get a banking system crisis,&quot; he surmises. Johnsons speaks on the impending, &quot;Great Reset,&quot; saying, &quot;whoever is in charge will have the biggest say in what system comes next, but it's still a few years down the road.&quot; He makes a strong case for owning precious metals in this environment, concluding that, &quot;there isn't anything more-long term bullish for gold than a strong dollar.&quot;<br /><br />⭐️ Join Daniela Cambone's exclusive community ➡️  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://danielacambone.com">https://danielacambone.com</a><br /><br />➡️  Follow us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/StansberryResearch">https://www.facebook.com/StansberryResearch</a> <br />➡️  Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/stansberry">https://twitter.com/stansberry</a> <br />➡️  Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/stansberry_research">https://www.instagram.com/stansberry_research</a><br />➡️  Follow us on LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/stanberry-research">https://www.linkedin.com/company/stanberry-research</a><br /><br />Chapters:<br /><br />0:00 Has the 'Dollar Milkshake Theory' begun?<br />2:47 Why does the dollar keep rising?<br />4:46 Will the Fed start doing QE?<br />7:45 The repercussions of a rising dollar<br />9:28 The alternative to the dollar<br />10:37 Possible replacements for the U.S. dollar?<br />12:38 Will the U.S. do everything it can to hold onto its power?<br />15:05 The possibility of de-dollarization<br />17:14 Will there be a new currency system?<br />19:14 Outlook for gold<br />19:54 How does monetary collapse affect the common person?<br />21:41 Have we reached the peak of inflation?{% endraw %}
