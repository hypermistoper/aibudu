Walmart, Target and others all look more or less the same. But there was one retailer in the mid to late 20th century that shook things up a bit. That invested into insane and bizarre architecture for their showrooms and was led by charismatic and innovative family. The BEST Products Company ultimately grew into 200 stores across the country and revenue of over $2 billion. But it all came crashing down in the late 90's and now is more or less forgotten about as truly one of the most unique retailers in history. So join me today as I explore the history of this truly incredible company. <br /><br />Patreon - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/BrightSunFilms">https://www.patreon.com/BrightSunFilms</a><br /><br />Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BrightSunFilms">https://twitter.com/BrightSunFilms</a><br /><br />Jake's Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/datJakeWilliams">https://twitter.com/datJakeWilliams</a><br /><br />Instagram - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightsunfilms">https://www.instagram.com/brightsunfilms</a><br /><br />My documentary - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.closedforstorm.com/">https://www.closedforstorm.com/</a><br /><br />--------------<br /><br />BrightSunFilms 2022<br /><br />Presented in 4K{% endraw %}
