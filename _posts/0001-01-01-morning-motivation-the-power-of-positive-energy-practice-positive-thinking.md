{% raw %}Morning Motivation - The Power Of Positive Energy - Practice Positive Thinking Everyday<br /><br />Featuring Joe Dispenza.<br />Edited by Letâ€™s Inspire.<br /><br />I am a very strong believer in the power of positive energy. I have seen, both in my personal and professional life, that your mind is the most powerful part of your being. The power of positive thinking is the idea that you can change your life by thinking positively about things. Tune up your inner vibrations and start feeling positive energy flow your way.<br /><br />â–ºVideo Credit:<br />Videoblocks<br />Movie Clips Used Under Fair Use<br /><br />ðŸ‘• Unofficial motivational/workout apparel for you: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rb.gy/gsn32c">https://rb.gy/gsn32c</a><br /><br />Try Audible for free to listen to your fav books: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3lNpdNc">https://amzn.to/3lNpdNc</a><br />Check out these motivational books:<br />David Goggins: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Ghqw6K">https://amzn.to/2Ghqw6K</a> (audiobook free with Audible)<br />Jocko Willink: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3gVqs9A">https://amzn.to/3gVqs9A</a> (audiobook free with Audible)<br />Jocko Willink: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Z37pnx">https://amzn.to/2Z37pnx</a> (audiobook free with Audible)<br />Gary John Bishop: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2F3GPnm">https://amzn.to/2F3GPnm</a> (audiobook free with Audible)<br />Mark Manson: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2YXSzP1">https://amzn.to/2YXSzP1</a> (audiobook free with Audible)<br /><br />Thank you for your usual support!<br /><br />â–ºDonâ€™t forget to subscribe to our channel:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/LetsInspire">https://www.youtube.com/c/LetsInspire</a><br /><br />â–ºMusic Credit:<br /><br />Composer: Whitesand (Martynas Lau)<br />Year: 2017<br />Title: Eternity<br /><br />â—‰ Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/martynlaur">https://www.facebook.com/martynlaur</a><br />â—‰ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/otEqJC">https://goo.gl/otEqJC</a> <br />â—‰ Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/JN3LUb">https://goo.gl/JN3LUb</a> (@martynas_lau)<br />â—‰ SoundCloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/martynaslau">https://soundcloud.com/martynaslau</a><br /><br />â–ºVideo footage:<br />All footage licensed under CC-BY 3.0 or from various video and stock footage websites.
