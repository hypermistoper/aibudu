Fruit flies go after anything sugary.<br />- Now, roll a piece of paper to create a funnel shape, and tape it so that it keeps its form. <br />- Stick the narrow end through the top of your base container so that the funnel is resting in the opening. <br />-  Finally, set your fruit fly trap near the infested area – perhaps near your fruit bowl, garbage, or sink. <br />- There's a similar method but with a little less crafting. All you need do is put ripe or rotten fruit in the bottom of a medium or large bowl. <br />- Throw in a sweet liquid as well, maybe soda or syrup.<br />- Cover the bowl as tightly as possible with plastic or Saran wrap. Grab a fork and poke holes around the top of the wrap.<br />- This is the same idea as the funnel method – we’re luring the fruit flies to a bait that they can get to while making it harder for them to escape.<br />- Take 2 medium-sized jars and fill them with fruit rinds and peels. Cover the mouths of your jars with clear stretchy plastic wrap. <br />- Poke a small hole, perhaps with a toothpick, in the middle of the dents; this is where the fruit flies will enter the trap.<br />- When you notice fruit flies in one jar, put it in the freezer. This will freeze the flies and their eggs! <br />- The one sure-fire way to prevent fruit flies in the first place is to store your fruit properly. <br />- Once the fruit is ripe, it’ll last much longer when refrigerated. <br />- Even if your bananas are black on the outside, still try refrigerating them – this may save the tasty inside.<br />- Citrus fruits like oranges and grapefruit stop ripening after they’re picked, so these can stay in the fridge for up to 3 weeks. <br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
