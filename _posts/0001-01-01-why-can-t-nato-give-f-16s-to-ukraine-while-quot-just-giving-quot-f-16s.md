{% raw %}While &quot;just giving&quot; F-16s or other NATO jets to Ukraine may seem simple, there are significant problems associated with this.<br /><br /><br />A jet like the F-16 takes at least 9 months of training.  While a Ukrainian MIG pilot might be able to get an eight hour block of instruction and take off, fly and land, problems come into play when the aircraft enters emergency conditions.  Switches and gauges are also in different positions. <br /><br /><br />Think about how long it takes to get use to a rental car, and now imagine trying to operate that rental in combat.<br /><br /><br />There is also the issue of maintenance.  Am F-16 requires 19 hours of skilled maintenance for every 1 hour of flight.  The aircraft also needs a complex logistical and parts chain.  <br /><br /><br />So giving F-16s or any NATO jet to Ukraine is not technically feasible.<br /><br /><br />References:<br /><br /><br />Training F-16 pilots<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.luke.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/358711/train-f-16-pilots-lukes-mission/">https://www.luke.af.mil/News/Article-Display/Article/358711/train-f-16-pilots-lukes-mission/</a><br /><br /><br />F-16 Maintenance Hours:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/f-16-at-spangdahlem-first-in-europe-to-hit-10-000-flight-hours-1.627241#:~:text=The%20F%2D16%20on%20average,as%20changing%20tires%20and%20oil.">https://www.stripes.com/theaters/europe/f-16-at-spangdahlem-first-in-europe-to-hit-10-000-flight-hours-1.627241#:~:text=The%20F%2D16%20on%20average,as%20changing%20tires%20and%20oil.</a><br /><br /><br />USAF Aircraft Availability On Long Downward Trend, CBO Says<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.airforcemag.com/article/usaf-aircraft-availability-on-long-downward-trend-cbo-says/">https://www.airforcemag.com/article/usaf-aircraft-availability-on-long-downward-trend-cbo-says/</a>{% endraw %}
