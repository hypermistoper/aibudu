Trust me, this stuff is important! <br /><br />Electronic devices typically require either 5 or 3.3 volts, sometimes both. Other common voltage requirements include 6 and 12 volts for motors and displays. Some complex designs (ie. a robot) require several different supplies with different current capabilities.<br /><br />When you build your latest robot or IoT device you’ll need to consider how you'll supply these voltages in the real world. On the workbench you can use a bench power supply if you have one, a USB adapter, or even the USB port on a computer (just like with the Arduino).<br /><br />But when your creation needs to exist on its own with a line-powered or battery power supply you’ll need to figure out how to get all of those voltages delivered to your components, preferably easily and inexpensively.  <br /><br />I have nine, yes nine methods of doing exactly that. Today I’ll show you a number of different voltage regulators and converters ranging from the classic 7805 3-pin voltage regulator to a tiny device that can supply a steady 5 volts even when your battery is about to die.<br /><br />Check out the following Table of Contents to skip ahead to the power supply solution of your choice. Or just sit back and enjoy the show.<br /><br />INTRO<br /><br />00:00 - Introduction<br />03:00 - Breadboard power supply module<br />06:28 - Power Supply Basics<br /><br />LINEAR REGULATORS<br /><br />11:42 - LM7805 - 5 Volt linear regulator<br />14:32 - LM317 - Variable linear regulator<br />17:52 - PSM-165 - 3.3 Volt linear regulator module<br />19:47 - AMS1117 - 5 Volt linear regulator module<br />21:43 - L4931CZ33-AP - 3.3 volt low voltage-drop regulator<br /><br />VOLTAGE CONVERTERS<br /><br />23:51 - Buck Converter Intro<br />24:41 - MINI-360 - Variable buck converter<br />26:46 - Boost Converter Intro<br />27:37 - PSM-205 - USB boost converter<br />29.07 - MT3608 - Variable boost converter<br />31:06- Buck Boost Converter Intro<br />33:06 - S9V11F5 - 5 Volt buck boost converter<br /><br />That last module is the one I was referring to earlier, it really is an amazing device and is perfect for your battery-powered projects.<br /><br />As with all of my videos, there is an article at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://dbot.ws/pwrvolt">https://dbot.ws/pwrvolt</a> where you will find more details regarding all of the voltage regulators, buck converters, boost converters, and buck-boost converters mentioned here.<br /><br />Now go power something up!{% endraw %}
