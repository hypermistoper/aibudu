{% raw %}Microsoft Purview is a comprehensive set of solutions to help govern, protect, and manage your data estate. Hear from Microsoft executives on this new product family and our vision for the future of data governance. Customers previously used Azure Purview for unified data governance and Microsoft 365 Compliance solutions to protect their data and manage risks across their organization. Since data governance and protection are inherently connected business problems, they must be treated in a holistic way. That is why we are extending the Purview name and bringing together data governance capabilities from Data &amp; AI and compliance and risk solutions from Security into one product family, and rebranding to Microsoft Purview.<br /><br />►Learn more about Microsoft Purview at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aka.ms/microsoftpurview">https://aka.ms/microsoftpurview</a><br /><br />► Subscribe to Microsoft Security on YouTube here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aka.ms/SubscribeMicrosoftSecurity">https://aka.ms/SubscribeMicrosoftSecurity</a><br /><br />► Follow us on social: <br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/microsoft-security/">https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/microsoft-security/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/msftsecurity">https://twitter.com/msftsecurity</a><br /><br />► Join our Tech Community: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aka.ms/SecurityTechCommunity">https://aka.ms/SecurityTechCommunity</a><br /><br />► For more about Microsoft Security: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://msft.it/6002T9HQY">https://msft.it/6002T9HQY</a><br /><br />#Microsoft #MicrosoftSecurity{% endraw %}
