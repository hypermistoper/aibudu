My Boyfriend Doesn't Make Time For Me!&quot;<br /><br />Does your boyfriend always seem too busy? Do you feel like an afterthought, like you have to bug him to get him to spend any time with you? I know how you feel.<br /><br />In this video I’ll guide you through a simple Quality Time Diagnostic that will determine if your relationship is in trouble. Then I’ll give you My four-quadrant method to maximizing One-On-One time with any man.<br /><br />I’m Amy North, a relationship coach from the West Coast of Canada. I’m here to tell you how to deal with a problem that I’ve been hearing about more and more lately. It starts with a message I got from one of my fans.<br /><br />Dear Amy. Thank you so much for your help over the years. Thanks to your videos I was able to land a great guy. Or so I thought. <br /><br />We’ve been together for six months now and basically things are getting serious. We just moved in together and at first I was so ecstatic. But since it happened, he hasn’t been spending any time with me. It seems like he always has something better to do and he says that he wants to but it doesn’t feel like he really does. What should I do?<br /><br />Signed,<br />Kailey <br /><br />It’s not the first time I’ve got it and I know it won’t be the last. So I was inspired to make a video for anyone who’s ever felt like Kailey does right now.<br /><br />Here are a few things you need to ask yourself if you aren’t happy with the amount of time your guy spends with you. This diagnostic is based on case studies from hundreds of real relationships that I’ve dealt with in my time as a relationship coach. These are now the first questions I ask any time a client is looking for more quality time in their relationship. Feel free to pause the video if needed and really take your time answering these questions as they’re a vital tool in the process.<br /><br />What are my expectations?<br /><br />How much time would you like to spend together? How often would you like to talk? What are some non-negotiable events or plans that he needs to be there for?<br /><br />I’m not saying your expectations are too high but I do know that it’s important to figure out what you want before you can try to get it. With that in mind, imagine your perfect week. How much time would you two spend together? Do you think this is reasonable to ask for?<br /><br />I think one of the most overlooked parts of relationships is the different expectations we each have and never voice.<br /><br />And more broadly speaking, ask yourself “what do I want from this relationship?” I’ve noticed that a lot of people want their relationship to solve all their problems and to be the main source of happiness in their life. This can put too much pressure on your guy and yourself to be this perfect couple. Closeness will come with time but you also need to make sure you continue to build other relationships and find different sources of happiness. This is the best path forward for yourself and your relationship.<br /><br />2. Is he busy or just not making an effort?<br /><br />If he’s always flaking on plans, never asking you out first, or disappearing for long periods of time then this might be a clear indicator that he’s not making an effort. This could mean that he’s pulling back from the relationship, that he doesn’t want to spend as much time together as you do, or that he’s just not very considerate.<br /><br />If he has a pretty demanding job and plenty of responsibilities and obligations on top of that, then maybe he really is just busy.<br /><br />I’m going to say something controversial here. Does it make a difference whether he’s busy or is not making an effort? Bottom line: if he isn’t there, he isn’t there. <br /><br />I know a lot of girls whose boyfriends or husbands are always busy and can barely make time for them. They all have this time on the horizon that they can finally be together as much as they’d like. Maybe he’s going to be finished this big project at work, the busy season will be over, or he’ll just start finally making time for her.<br /><br />But more often than not, this time never comes. Busy people tend to only get busier. If this is your guy then you need to be realistic about how much you can expect to be together and whether or not you can be happy with that?<br /><br />There are plenty of women who want a guy who is driven and ambitious. These guys can often struggle with priorities and work-life balance. <br />It’s nice when your guy has a reason to leave the house in the morning and a job that he’s passionate about but sometimes it’s not worth the trade off. <br /><br />*** More from Amy North: ***<br />How to Get A Man: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.coachnorth.com">http://www.coachnorth.com</a><br />Love Learnings: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.lovelearnings.com">https://www.lovelearnings.com</a><br />Google+: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://plus.google.com/116823069948654495789">https://plus.google.com/116823069948654495789</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/amy.north.798">https://www.facebook.com/amy.north.798</a>{% endraw %}
