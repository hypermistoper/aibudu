{% raw %}The Vision reveals S.W.O.R.D. director, Tyler Hayward, orders to eliminate Wanda, and when he attempts to kill her, he is foiled by Wanda's created Vision. After an impressive fight across Westview, the two Visions take their battle into a library where Wanda's Vision persuades S.W.O.R.D. Vision by restoring his memories, and the latter departs Westview. <br /><br />I think one of the odd mistakes in this scene is the S.W.O.R.D. Vision braking the window when leaving for nowhere. I think he might forget about his abilities, but why? Another mistake occurres when the RV explodes at 0:31. It blows up right before the white Vision hits it.<br /><br />What do you think of the fight between the Visions? Who is the winner of the conflict between the Vision and S.W.O.R.D. Vision? How do you feel about Wanda's Vision's philosophy? Why did the white Vision break the window at the end of the video? Do you think the white Vision will return? In what movie? When? Did you find other mistakes or plotholes? Do you have any suggestions or ideas? Share your opinion with the world in the comment section below. I put the video in 4K and removed the background music score to help you focus thoroughly on CGI and SFX.<br /><br />0:00 | S.W.O.R.D.
