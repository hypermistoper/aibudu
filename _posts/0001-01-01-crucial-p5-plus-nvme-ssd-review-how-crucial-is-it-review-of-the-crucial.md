If you are a already established data storage media provider or are already an established name in PC components, then that almost certainly means that you either already have or are planning on releasing your own storage. The latest company to introduce a PCIe 4.0 M.2 NVMe SSD is Crucial with their P5 Plus series. Already a big name in memory modules and extending their existing range of Solid State Drives, the Crucial P5 Plus is an unusual competitor to the current growing pack of 7,000MB/s solutions, in that it arrives with a lower 6,600MB/s reported maximum, but with much higher endurance and an in-house designed architecture. For those that aren't aware, Crucial and Micron are effectively one and the same, which means that this SSD arrives from the same house that makes a large proportion of the NAND used in their competitor's hardware, so I have high hopes for how well this device performs, as although they are the first to vouch that their top speed is a pinch lesser than some, they get quite close and do so at a better price point than most. Additionally, the Crucial P5 Plus arrives amidst a deluge of other PCIe4 M.2 NVMe SSDs from the likes of Seagate, MSI, Gigabyte and more, so we need to see what this new SSD brings to the table as it's USP. So, let's take a look and see if the Critical P5 Plus NVMe SSD is a mature storage choice or a little late to the party?
