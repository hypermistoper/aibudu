{% raw %}Elden Ring - Duo Tree Sentinel Boss Fight (No Damage Taken) &amp; Location in Altus Plateau / Duo Tree Sentinel No Damage Boss Fight Guide Melee Only, Solo, No Summons / Tutorial / How To Beat Duo Tree Sentinel Elden Ring.  Just a quick video showing the Duo Tree Sentinel boss fight and location in Elden Ring.  Details below.<br /><br />Seems daunting at first, but if you just wait for the long charge attack you have a lot of safe windows to attack.  When it was just down to the single boss I could've played more aggressively, but I couldn't really remember the phase 2 attack patterns from the start of the game, so I played it safe with baitng the charge attacks still.<br /><br />Game progression:  I'll be progressing through the game naturally, trying to find all the side-dungeons and bosses along the way, and post them as I go.  I won't be farming for levels or materials, but at the same time I won't be actively avoiding them to keep under level either.  There may be some bosses I miss along the way and come back to later, or naturally I might end up stronger for some fights compared to others as I progress.  I'll be uploading all bosses, so some will obviously be a lot easier than others.  The strategies I show will work regardless of level or upgrades though, as shown by all the previous FromSoftware boss fights uploaded on the channel.  Feel free to check those out too!  By this stage, I did end up actively avoiding leveling up for over 50 bosses in total, and I haven't farmed anything in between.<br /><br />Repeat bosses:  There's quite a few repeat bosses in different zones that are essentially the same fight, but I'll still be uploading each individual one to show the location of them.  As I'll eventually have a no damage all bosses compilation, I want to include every single one, even if they are repeats.  It does mean some will appear multiple times without significant differences to them, but I'd rather just have each of them individually on the channel to show the locations, rather than pick or choose a single one to upload and skip the rest.<br /><br />Elden Ring All Bosses No Damage &amp; Full Game Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWOYpP6sq1Fs-XJWHDiOyf5OL8zHpSq1l">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWOYpP6sq1Fs-XJWHDiOyf5OL8zHpSq1l</a><br />All FromSoftware Boss Fights No Damage: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWOYpP6sq1FuJGg6VY-C_VpAbLqH-gxiu">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWOYpP6sq1FuJGg6VY-C_VpAbLqH-gxiu</a><br /><br />PC setup:<br />MSI MPG Z490 Mobo, i9-10900k CPU, MSI RTX 3090 SUPRIM X GPU, 64GB DDR4 3200 C16 Ram, 1TB NVMe M.2 SSD, 8TB HDD<br /><br />==================================================<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/esoterickk?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/esoterickk?sub_confirmation=1</a><br />BECOME A CHANNEL MEMBER HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/esoterickk/join">https://www.youtube.com/esoterickk/join</a><br />Thank you so much for your support!{% endraw %}
