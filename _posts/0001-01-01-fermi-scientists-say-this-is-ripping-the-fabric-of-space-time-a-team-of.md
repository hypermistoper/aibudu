{% raw %}A team of researchers have recently detected massive ripples in the space-time continuum which likely indicate &quot;cataclysmic events&quot; are happening all around us. <br /><br />Our entire universe is one big chaotic sea of ripples in space time otherwise known as gravitational waves. Astronomers and scientists have long believed these waves to originate from orbiting or merging black holes in distant galaxies, and have been desperately trying to observe them for decades now. <br /><br />Now, they might be one step closer and all thanks to a special team of international scientists and a little help from NASA. <br /><br />Welcome to Factnomenal and in today's video we will take a look at how NASAâ€™s FERMI Gamma ray telescope could play a key factor in studying these exotic astrophysical scenarios. <br /><br /><br />Buy us a coffee to show your support!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Factnomenal">https://www.buymeacoffee.com/Factnomenal</a>  <br /><br />DON'T CLICK THIS LINK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tinyurl.com/357shs3j">https://tinyurl.com/357shs3j</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching Factnomenal!<br />ðŸŒŽ Subscribe for more space discoveries, space facts, and space in general!<br />ðŸ”” Hit the bell next to subscribe so you never miss a video!<br /><br /><br />â–º For copyright matters, make sure to send us an email to Adam@trustedmiddle.com<br /><br />#Factnomenal #FERMI #SpaceTime{% endraw %}
