The video shows the city decoration with lighting on  National Day . <br />UAE's National Day  is celebrated on 2 December each year in the United Arab Emirates, and marks the UAE's formal nationalization and the start of the federal unification of the emirates in 1971.  The six emirates (seven in 1972 after Ras Al Khaimah joined) in 1971 which combined to form the modern-day country.<br />Grand celebrations are held across the country to mark the event. Fireworks, car rallies and dance shows are the most common activities.  People  usually dress up in UAE national flag colours and decorate their homes, workplaces, cars and streets to celebrate the day. Palm trees are decorated with lights from the colours of the flag.
