We have a dream to build a self sustainable future and regenerate the land for generations to come. Join us as we learn to build, farm, garden, and care for the animals and land. <br /><br />We live and farm on the land of the Arakwal and Minjungbal people of the Bundjalung Nation and these practices of regenerative living, agriculture and permaculture owe their roots and theories to Indigenous knowledge — they have been practiced by Indigenous People around the world for so many years. We acknowledge the Traditional Custodians of the Country we live on, and recognise their continuing connection to the land and waters. We thank them for protecting this rainforest and its ecosystems since time immemorial.<br /><br />Music:<br />Amarante: “Dancing in the Dying Light (Instrumental)” and “Alone (Instrumental)”<br />Georgina Grimshaw: “Nothing To Hide (Instrumental)”<br />Land of Trees: &quot;From These Ashes (Instrumental)”<br /><br />A big thank you to all of the incredible artists who share their music in each episode!
