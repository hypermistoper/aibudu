{% raw %}Panzerfaust 3 is a shoulder-launched weapon with a fire control launcher unit. It has proved its mettle in the Ukraine.<br /><br />The Panzerfaust 3 has expanded in many variants. One of them is Bunkerfaust, an anti-structure version and is often referred to as Bkf. This weapon is specially designed for urban combat.<br /><br />There is also a Panzerfaust 3-T variant that uses a rocket with a tandem HEAT warhead. And the Panzerfaust 3-IT can beat the newest tanks and is heavily armored with reactive armor. Some sources report that the variant penetrated more than 900 mm of armor, and if valid, the penetration behind the ERA could be around 700 mm.<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />Watch more videos:<br />FGM-148 Javelin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/PWqIXKh6T1c">https://youtu.be/PWqIXKh6T1c</a><br /><br />Support us: <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/usamilitarynews/">https://www.instagram.com/usamilitarynews/</a><br />SUBSCRIBE OF THIS CHANNEL: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ovplYy">http://bit.ly/2ovplYy</a><br /><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: usmilitarynewsofficial@gmail.com{% endraw %}
