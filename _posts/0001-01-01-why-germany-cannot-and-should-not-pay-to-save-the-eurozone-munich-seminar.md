{% raw %}Munich Seminar on 11 June 2018 with Prof. Yanis Varoufakis in the Grosse Aula of the Ludwig-Maximilian University<br />www.ifo.de/w/hR6vuRDF<br /><br />The euro crisis has highlighted the urgent need for reform in the Eurozone. However, approaches to a solution can be divided into two camps. The dissent, primarily between France and Germany, is reflected very clearly in their different attitudes towards fiscal union. While the French strongly support a fiscal union, which necessarily implies fiscal transfers by Germany and other donor countries, Germany absolutely rejects a fiscal union and favours a post-crisis write-off of bad loans instead.<br /><br />In his speech Professor Varoufakis will argue that both visions are flawed and potentially even dangerous. Moreover, the proposal to draft a new constitution for the Eurozone would not represent any real progress in the current political climate. Instead Professor Varoufakis clearly differentiates between the solution to the Eurozone’s structural problems and the zeal and ambitions of the political class.<br />Interview: Why Germany Cannot and Should Not Pay to Save the Eurozone  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/dFCDP0QKwk0">https://youtu.be/dFCDP0QKwk0</a><br />Discussion <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/00BiiamS2f4">https://youtu.be/00BiiamS2f4</a><br /><br />ifo Institut – Leibniz-Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung an der Universität München e.V.{% endraw %}
