{% raw %}This is the new Leica M11 rangefinder flagship camera. Coming off a legacy of over 60 years of Leica M and on the heals of the M10-r - Leica has announced a camera with a 60 megapixel, tri-resolution sensor that is capable of 60mp, 36mp or 18mp with full sensor and 14 bit color readout in both RAW DNG and JPG formats. Using oversampling and pixel binning, lower resolutions give better noise performance at high ISO settings as well as an extra stop of dynamic range. This is one of the more unique cameras in the market right now. While the Sony A1, Canon R3 and Nikon Z9 all go for speed, Leica has given us a traditional photography experience with a very unique sensor with amazing image quality.<br /><br />Current M11 Pricing <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ntt=leica%20m11&amp;N=0&amp;InitialSearch=yes&amp;sts=ma&amp;BI=8986&amp;KBID=10442&amp;SID=DFF">https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ntt=leica%20m11&amp;N=0&amp;InitialSearch=yes&amp;sts=ma&amp;BI=8986&amp;KBID=10442&amp;SID=DFF</a><br />Visoflex 2 (electronic viewfinder) Pricing <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ntt=leica%20visoflex&amp;N=0&amp;InitialSearch=yes&amp;sts=ma&amp;BI=8986&amp;KBID=10442&amp;SID=DFF">https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/search?Ntt=leica%20visoflex&amp;N=0&amp;InitialSearch=yes&amp;sts=ma&amp;BI=8986&amp;KBID=10442&amp;SID=DFF</a><br /><br />Index: <br />Intro/Sample Images 0:00<br />Why how the M11 Different? 0:41<br />Leica M11 Customizable Buttons and Design 1:23<br />How to Customize the Leica M11 Custom Functions 2:04<br />M11 vs M10 Indicator Lights 2:24<br />M11 Baseplate 2:35<br />Battery 3:12<br />Menus in the M11 3:51<br />Battery Life 4:36<br />M11 Silver Vs Black 6:19<br />The New 60 MP BSI Sensor 6:26<br />Low Light Performance 8:43<br />Connecting the M11 to the iPhone 11:41 <br />Leica Visoflex 2 12:25 <br />Electronic Shutter 13:00 <br />Experience with the M11 over 3 weeks 14:18 <br />Image Quality 15:21<br />What about an M11 Monochrom? 16:43<br /><br /><br />More Leica Videos <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU5gSo5hTJo&amp;list=PLGEE7pGLuppSoflSumAKqUeqWpQl_X_w-&amp;ab_channel=TheArtofPhotography">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UU5gSo5hTJo&amp;list=PLGEE7pGLuppSoflSumAKqUeqWpQl_X_w-&amp;ab_channel=TheArtofPhotography</a><br /><br />My Adobe Lightroom and Capture One Presets <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://theartofphotography.tv/presets/">https://theartofphotography.tv/presets/</a><br />Music is from Epidemic Sound <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/v5wWKr">https://goo.gl/v5wWKr</a><br />AoP T-Shirts <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://aop.threadless.com/">https://aop.threadless.com/</a><br />Need a website? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://squarespace.com/aop">http://squarespace.com/aop</a><br /><br />On my channel you will find videos about photography, cinematography, post processing tutorials for Capture One, Lightroom and Photoshop, photo assignments that YOU can participate in, the Artist Series and more.
