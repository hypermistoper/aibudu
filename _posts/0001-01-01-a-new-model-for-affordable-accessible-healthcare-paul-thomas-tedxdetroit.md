Dr Paul Thomas is a Family Medicine doctor in Detroit, delivering affordable, accessible health care in a neighborhood with no other primary care doctors. Completed medical school at Wayne State and residency at Oakwood. On a mission to revolutionize our health care delivery system, one patient at a time.
