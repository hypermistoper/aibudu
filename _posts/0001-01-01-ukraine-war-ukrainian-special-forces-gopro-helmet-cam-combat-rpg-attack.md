{% raw %}A video from the instagram page of an alleged Ukrainian Special Forces operator shows what has to be the first ever released helmet cam GoPro combat video from the war in Ukraine.<br /><br />The video shows two Ukrainian Special Forces Soldiers engaging and destroying a Russian T-72 tank with two accuarte RPG rocket hits.<br /><br />The anti-tank launchers used here are either RPG-22 or RPG-26 launchers.<br /><br />Both are one-shot disposable anti-tank rocket launchers made to disable tanks.<br /><br />Pictures also included on the Instagram post later show the disabled Russian tank with a clearly visible V marking indicating the tank crossed the border from Belarus in to Ukraine.<br /><br />While the exact time and location of this video was not disclosed it is possible that the event could have taken place some days before and the footage was not released earlier because of OpSec reasons.<br /><br />Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ua_reg/">https://www.instagram.com/ua_reg/</a><br /><br />WarLeaks - Military Blog covers events, news, missions &amp; facts from the United States Armed Forces including the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy,  U.S. Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard and more!
