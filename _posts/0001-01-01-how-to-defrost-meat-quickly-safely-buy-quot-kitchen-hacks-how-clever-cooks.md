Need chicken, steak, or pork on the table tonight? This hot test kitchen trick defrosts meat fast &amp; quickly, in minutes—and doesn't risk overcooking it, like the microwave does.<br /><br />We always thaw large cuts (entire roasts and whole birds like chicken and turkey) in the refrigerator, but we also use the quick-thaw method for cuts that are 1 inch thick or less. Simply seal the meat in zipper-lock bags and submerge the bags in very hot (140-degree) water. This way, the meat defrosts quickly and bacterial growth remains in the “safe” range. We’ve found that quick-thawed meat is indistinguishable from meat defrosted in the refrigerator (including chicken breasts, which may turn slightly opaque once thawed).<br /><br />Note on thawing meat: Do NOT simply leave it out on the counter! Frozen meat left on the counter can begin to grow microorganisms in as little as 2 hours.<br /><br />More tips on how to defrost meat: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://cooks.io/2ltp9lH">http://cooks.io/2ltp9lH</a><br /><br />WATCH: Make the Best Steaks By Cooking Frozen Meat (No Thawing!) <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLWsEg1LmaE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLWsEg1LmaE</a><br /><br />WATCH: The Best Way to Sear a Steak <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45Ch3PMDe30">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=45Ch3PMDe30</a><br /><br />ABOUT US: Located in Boston’s Seaport District in the historic Innovation and Design Building, America's Test Kitchen features 15,000 square feet of kitchen space including multiple photography and video studios.
