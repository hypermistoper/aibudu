{% raw %}While on a run recently, I had a great idea of how to display the day and date on a wristwatch, using the Seiko NH36 movement. Normally, the feature is included at the 3:00 position, in a line. Well, why not centrally locate both at the 6:00, making for a symmetric design. The &quot;DAY-T&quot; was born! The day and date are easily viewable through a &quot;T&quot; shaped aperture at the 6:00 position.<br /><br />Additionally, we are checking out a new red dial field watch, as well as reboots of existing DLC field watch designs which sold out quickly the last time we had them.<br /><br />Check out all the Islander field watches at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://longislandwatch.com/shop/?search=islander+automatic+field+watch">https://longislandwatch.com/shop/?search=islander+automatic+field+watch</a><br /><br />Follow us for more.
