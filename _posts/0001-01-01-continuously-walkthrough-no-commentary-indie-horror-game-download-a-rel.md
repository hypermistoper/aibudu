{% raw %}Download: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://gamejolt.com/games/continuously/73730">https://gamejolt.com/games/continuously/73730</a> <br />Game Info: You wake up in an unknown area wondering what is going on. You venture deep into the stairwell and discover that you are beginning in the same place you end. You keep venturing to notice paranormal activities to occur. After a long cycle of loops you discover that a young lady was violently murdered in the floor 2 area. Her story is unveiled the deeper you go in.<br />ContinuousLY is pretty much the second step in regards to Continuous. If you have ever played my game Continuous, then you would know that it revolves around a loop system which repeats the map over and over again but with different scares (A P.T. inspired game).<br />ContinuousLY has the same system but with a new map, new scares, new enemy and twice as long gameplay. ContinuousLY is also using Unity 5 rather than Unity 4 which continuous used.{% endraw %}
