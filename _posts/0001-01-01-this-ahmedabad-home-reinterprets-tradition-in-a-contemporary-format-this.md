{% raw %}This three-bedroom apartment called Samsara, in a building on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, identifies at the very cellular level with its inhabitants, including their inherent love for the antique crafts.<br /><br />Bhoomi Dani and Priyam Shah live in this soothing home with their little child Samayama. According to them, their home “Samsara” is a conscious attempt at building a collective roof, where artisans, textiles, culture and modern ideas coexist. It is their underlying design philosophy that contemporised antique craft-making techniques hailing from the Kutch region, that buoys Vraj:bhoomi and reflects so completely in their home.<br /><br />Click the link here to read more about this lovely home where you'll find tradition, art, craft, and modernity under one roof!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.beautifulhomes.com/living/homes/this-ahmedabad-home-reinterprets-tradition-in-a-contemporary-format.html">https://www.beautifulhomes.com/living/homes/this-ahmedabad-home-reinterprets-tradition-in-a-contemporary-format.html</a><br /><br />For more home tours, house design inspirations and design ideas, check out our social media handles!<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/34s2hwu-bhfacebook">http://bit.ly/34s2hwu-bhfacebook</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/3kybY1T-bh-instagram">http://bit.ly/3kybY1T-bh-instagram</a>{% endraw %}
