{% raw %}How To Identify Male and Female Cannabis Flowers<br /><br />Professor DeBacco<br /><br /><br />Pre-Flowers<br />Growers should first look at the nodes (junction of leaves/branches and the stalks of the plant).<br />Pre-flowers begin to develop 4-6 weeks into the growing cycle at the nodes and during this time growers should be able to identify the gender of the plant as male or female.<br />These are immature flowers and will show the male or female morphology well before they are able to produce viable components for seed production.<br />Removing males at this time will help ensure no chance of accidental pollination will occur.<br />Male pre-flowers: Look for small pollen sacs<br />Female pre-flowers: Look for two stigmas (typically white) <br /><br /><br /><br />Female Plants<br />Females are the plants that will produce the cannabinoids in the greatest concentrations in the flowers.<br />If female plants receive pollen from male plants seeds will be produced which will drastically reduce cannabinoid production.<br />Cannabis is grown via sinsemilla (“seedless”) by removing male pollen producing plants to prevent seed production.<br />This allows for the cannabis plant to focus its energy on cannabinoid production instead of seeds.<br />Female plants will only be pollinated to produce seeds for breeding purposes.<br /><br /><br /><br />Male Plants<br />Male cannabis plants grow pollen sacs instead of buds and are often discarded to avoid female plants from being pollinated.<br />Males are important in the breeding process<br />Pollinating male plants shape, rate of growth, pest and mold resistance, and climate resilience can important for breeding purposes.<br />Male plants can also be used for:<br />Hemp fiber and in some cases concentrate production but concentration is much less than female plants.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Link to Lecture Slides: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AkvMIKQ1mkznvdACs8kh0wtugY1kH76w/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AkvMIKQ1mkznvdACs8kh0wtugY1kH76w/view?usp=sharing</a><br /><br />*Due to the description character limit the full work cited for &quot;How To Identify Male and Female Cannabis Flowers&quot; can be viewed at... <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bNgSYUvqqxdwy_r6k5tVG8kUw2BB9XFZ/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bNgSYUvqqxdwy_r6k5tVG8kUw2BB9XFZ/view?usp=sharing</a>{% endraw %}
