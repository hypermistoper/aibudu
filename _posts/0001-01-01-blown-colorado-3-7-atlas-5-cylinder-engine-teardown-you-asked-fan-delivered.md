{% raw %}Email ALL part requests to Importapartsales@gmail.com.    <br />Huge thanks to Bill, a fan of the channel and a customer for supplying this weeks teardown! He brought this 3.7L 5 cylinder from his 2011 Colorado which he is LS swapping to me as a gift when picking up a 5.3 and associated parts this week. I've had an overwhelming number of requests for a GM Atlas family engine, but its usually not something I run across. This is one of the very few scenarios in which one would make it into the shop so for that I am grateful! The Atlas family of engines are found in the Chevrolet Colorado, GMC Canyon, Hummer H3, Chevrolet trailblazer, GMC Envoy, Buick Rainier, Isuzu Ascender, Saab 9-7x, and Oldsmobile Bravada, starting in 2002. <br /><br />My name is Eric and I own and run a full service auto salvage business called Importapart located in the Saint Louis MO area. Part of our model is dismantling and selling parts from rare and niche market engines. I don't build or rebuild engines, we simply supply hard parts to those that do! <br />Want to see a particular engine torn down? I may have already done one! No really, check out my other videos for the engine you'd like to see! I've made over 70 other teardowns from a Cummins to an LS7, and from Rotary to Ram Ecodiesels. You can expect a new teardown every week!<br />Check them out here  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIYwo7JlrVQVg32JL-r4H7dfMxMqzWlVa">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIYwo7JlrVQVg32JL-r4H7dfMxMqzWlVa</a><br /><br /><br />As always I appreciate all of the comments, feedback and even the criticism. <br />What will I tear apart next week? Just wait and see!<br /> -Eric{% endraw %}
