{% raw %}City to City is an album by Scottish singer-songwriter Gerry Rafferty. It was Rafferty's first solo release in six years - and first release of any kind since 1975 - due to his tenure in the band Stealer's Wheel and subsequent legal proceedings which prevented Rafferty from releasing any new solo recordings for the next three years. The album was strongly received, peaking at #1 in the US and going Platinum[4], as well as reaching #6 in the UK and achieving Gold status. &quot;Baker Street&quot;, &quot;Right Down the Line&quot; and &quot;Home and Dry&quot; were successfully released as singles. &quot;Baker Street&quot; is widely perceived as Rafferty's signature song and by October 2010 had reached 5 million plays on British radio.{% endraw %}
