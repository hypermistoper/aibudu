Ravnsborg will at least temporarily be removed from office pending the historic Supreme Court Senate trial, where it takes a two-thirds majority to convict on impeachment charges. Ravnsborg pleaded no contest last year to a pair of traffic misdemeanors in the crash, including making a non-legal lane change. He has cast Joseph Boever’s demise as a tragic accident. He sent lawmakers a pair of defiant letters urging them to vote against impeachment. “In a few hours, your vote will set a precedent for years to come,” Ravnsborg said in the first of two letters sent Monday night and obtained by the Argus Leader. “No state has ever impeached an elected official for a traffic accident.” The South Dakota Legislature had never investigated impeachment for an elected official, and only once, in 1917, launched an impeachment inquiry into a circuit judge. South Dakota ag Ravnsborg’s letter also accused Republican Gov. Kristi Noem of interfering in the investigation and of supporting impeachment because of the attorney general’s investigations into her behavior. A second letter from Ravnsborg’s spokesman delved into “evidence, allegations and misconceptions,” about the case.<br /><br />On February 17, 2021, Ravnsborg was charged with three misdemeanors: operating his vehicle while using his cell phone, driving outside his lane, and careless driving. Prosecutors chose not to charge Ravnsborg with vehicular homicide or second-degree manslaughter, and South Dakota has no negligent homicide law. On March 12, 2021, court officials moved the trial proceedings from Hyde County to Hughes County and Ravnsborg pleaded not guilty to all charges.<br /><br />The Behavior Panel is a group made up of the world's top 4 body language and behavior experts, Scott Rouse, Mark Bowden, Chase Hughes, and Greg Hartley. Together they analyze the body language and behavior displayed in videos in the public interest. The Behavior Panel is a non-partisan group, looking to educate and entertain the public with their interest and expertise in nonverbal communication, body language, deception detection, interrogation, and resistance to interrogation. By looking at the gestures, facial expressions, micro-expressions, and context around what people say, this group of nonverbal behavior experts reveals the possible truth and deceptions. This behavior profiler group takes on the task of investigating the behavior behind the true crime news that often forces us to think and feel the way we do. The Behavior Panel is featured on The Dr. Phil Show.<br /><br />Chapters:<br /><br />00:00 - Intro<br /><br />#JasonRavnsborg #Impeachment #Interrogation{% endraw %}
