{% raw %}This video demonstrates the importance of applying adhesion promoter to plastic before applying paint or filler.  It shows you how well Polyvance's Plastic Magic and Filler Prep help paint and filler to stick.<br /><br />Plastic Magic Adhesion Promoter is a surface modifier and works like magic to eliminate the paint peeling problems on automotive plastics. There is no need to identify the type of plastic. Plastic Magic works on TPO and all other problem plastics to make primers and paints stick to any kind of automotive plastic, inside or outside the vehicle.<br /><br />Filler Prep Adhesion Promoter helps filler stick to plastic. It's necessary when applying fillers to TPO and polypropylene parts, like most late model bumper covers. Filler Prep allows the filler to get a good &quot;bite&quot; on the plastic and eliminates the peeling problems common on many automotive plastics. Each can has a brush on the lid and is ready to be used as soon as you open the can.<br /><br />Plastic Magic demonstration: 0:11<br />Filler Prep demonstration: 0:57<br /><br />View this video on our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.polyvance.com/video/products-tools/adhesion-promoter-why-it-is-important">https://www.polyvance.com/video/products-tools/adhesion-promoter-why-it-is-important</a><br /><br />Polyvance Product Links:<br /><br />1050-A Plastic Magic Adhesion Promoter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/6QioSY">https://goo.gl/6QioSY</a><br /><br />1060-FP Filler Prep Adhesion Promoter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/73bYyz">https://goo.gl/73bYyz</a><br /><br /><br />‚ö†Ô∏è Important ‚ö†Ô∏è<br />- Always wear proper safety gear while working!<br />- The length of this video is in no way representative of the actual time required to perform a complete repair and therefore should not be used for estimating purposes.<br /><br /><br />‚úÖ SUBSCRIBE to our channel for updates on our products and tutorials!
