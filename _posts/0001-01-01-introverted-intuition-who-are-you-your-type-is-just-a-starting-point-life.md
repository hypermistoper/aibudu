{% raw %}Please do not mistake passion for anger or crazy. Most if not all who watch me are too young to remember what passion is and what it looks like. Another human emotion that has been lost is what is known as pride. When you combine Pride in 'Self' and Passion for 'Life', you will get a person that looks and acts like me. <br /><br />Can you even name something that you are willing to die for?  Chances are that you cannot. Do you not ever think about how that came to be or why you are without passion? Religion or God do not count for if that is your answer then you are and have lost your total self. - Marty{% endraw %}
