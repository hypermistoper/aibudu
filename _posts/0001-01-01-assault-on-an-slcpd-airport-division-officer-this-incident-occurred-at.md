{% raw %}This incident occurred at approximately 8:40 a.m. on Saturday March 12, 2022, when a 33-year-old man approached two SLCPD officers as they conducted foot patrols on the lower level of the airport concourse. The man, without warning, dropped his bag and then punched an officer in the head, nearly knocking him to the ground. After the punch, the man turned his attention toward the second officer and appeared to throw a second punch but immediately transitioned into a position of surrender and put his hands up. Officers safely took the man into custody and booked him into the Salt Lake County Metro Jail on a charge of Assaulting a Police Officer. The case is now referred to the United States Attorney’s Office for federal prosecution. <br /><br />Information about the suspect’s ticketing status of that day is not known at this time, pending the ongoing investigation.{% endraw %}
