{% raw %}LIVE TRADING CHANNEL: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/TheStockMarket">https://www.youtube.com/TheStockMarket</a><br /><br />The stock market is shaping up for a historic week as bankers and investors across the globe discuss the prospects of a global financial meltdown as a result of more Russian escalation. This weekend was filled with many updates, namely targeted removal of Russian banks from SWIFT and even nuclear escalation by Putin. This led to runs on Russian banks and global currencies and commodities to already surge, depending on where futures are in the morning and how these markets open, it may very well trigger an immediate default on Russian bonds. The UN even called an emergency meeting, which they haven't done in decades, to figure out the situation. I go over the markets this week and what to expect, then I go over the possible situations and how this could relate to US equities. I go over my plays on Brent crude and AA stock and how I will look for arbitrage moves in the morning. Then I go over TLT stock and why US bonds will be key this week, along with travel stocks and the global impact. All in all, this will be a pivotal week and it may not be over quick. Last time we were this close to a stop of global payments and meltdown was 2020 or 2008, I HOPE YOU ARE READY!
