The warning tells of a plot by Catholic terrorists to blow up the king and his ministers as they sit through a state opening. Guards are sent to search the cellars, and sure enough a pile of coals hides a huge stash of deadly explosives, enough to blow the Palace of Westminster sky-high. A solitary figure spotted nearby, wrapped in a cape and holding a lantern, is soon arrested. He is unmasked as a mercenary called Guy Fawkes, the plot to blow up the Houses of Parliament is foiled, and a new date is imprinted on a nation's consciousness.<br /><br />From Elizabeth II to Cleopatra, Real Royalty peels back the curtain to give a glimpse into the lives of some of the most influential families in the world, with new full length documentaries posted every week covering the monarchies of today and all throughout history.<br /><br />ðŸ“º It's like Netflix for history...
