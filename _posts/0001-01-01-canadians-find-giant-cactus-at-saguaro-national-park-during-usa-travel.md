{% raw %}RVing to Arizona has been SO worth it for us. As Canadians RVing the USA seeing GIANT CACTUS was a high priority on our list of sights to see, and what better place than the official SAGUARO NATIONAL PARK! We are still RV camping at Picacho Peak State Park as it is a relatively short drive to Saguaro NP, and also has Saguaro cactus in the campsite there to enjoy as well. WE LOVE IT. <br /><br />We also visited the Sonoran Desert Museum as it is mostly an outdoor exhibit type of museum. It really gives you a great perspective of the Sonoran desert area so if you are visiting Arizona and want a crash course in all the local cactus, plants AND animals be sure to consider it. The Sonoran Desert museum is just down the road from Saguaro National Park as well so if you have the time they pair together great. This area of RV traveling the USA has been so unlike any other place we've been to in our life and we are so grateful to visit it. We definitely want to come back sooner than later to the Sonoran Arizona area.<br /><br />Coming up next in our USA RV road trip we are going to be starting to head to Northern Arizona to see how the high desert will compare to the Sonoran area and also make our way to more BIG National Parks. We have some pretty awesome RV camping spots to get to and sights to see so stay tuned for the next RV vlogs friends!<br /><br />Luke and Alysha<br /><br />Check out our Patreon if you'd like to help be a part of creating more vlogs and exciting travels to come, and get perks a long the way!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/lukeandalysha">https://www.patreon.com/lukeandalysha</a><br /><br />Subscribe üôÇ : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/lukeandalysha">https://www.youtube.com/c/lukeandalysha</a><br /><br />Check Out Our Gear!
