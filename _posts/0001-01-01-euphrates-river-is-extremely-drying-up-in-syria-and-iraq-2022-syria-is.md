{% raw %}Syria is in the grips of the worst drought in 70 years. Millions of Syrians face water crisis. The reasons are both environmental and man-made. It is said that Less water flowing into the river from upstream, accompanied by irregular and reduced rainfall and higher-than-average temperatures, has created drought-like conditions in the region, according to the U.N. report. The severity of the situation in Syria, say some experts, is largely attributed to the impact of climate change in the region.{% endraw %}
