{% raw %}The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcano in Tonga just produced a second new eruption of the year, sending a plume of ash 16,800 meters or 55,000 feet into the atmosphere. This new eruption occurred alongside a surprise tsunami, which was likely generated by a volcanic edifice collapse. At the present, the Tonga coastline including Tongatapu is under a tsunami warning, as more small tsunamis may occur as the eruption continues. This video will separate fact from fiction and discuss what size and duration of volcanic activity is expected at Hunga Tonga. It is a very famous volcano as it has produced several spectacular island forming eruptions in the 21st century.<br /> <br />Volcanic ash advisory center:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vaac.metservice.com/">http://vaac.metservice.com/</a><br />For information on potential ash advisories of this volcano, select the Wellington center.<br /><br />If you would like to support this channel, consider becoming a patron at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/geologyhub.">http://patreon.com/geologyhub.</a><br /><br />Another way to support this channel is to make an order via our gemstone and geology related etsy store at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.">http://prospectingarizona.etsy.com.</a><br /><br />This channel's merch store is also on etsy at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://geologyhub.etsy.com.">http://geologyhub.etsy.com.</a><br /><br />0:00 Introduction, A Brand New Eruption<br />0:48 A Tsunami Occurs<br />2:40 Context/Background of this Latest Eruption<br />3:40 What will happen next<br /><br />Special Thanks to: @alakihihifo, @platformadam (both on twitter){% endraw %}
