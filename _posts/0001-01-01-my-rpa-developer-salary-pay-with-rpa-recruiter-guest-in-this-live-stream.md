{% raw %}In this Live Stream, I share my 2021 salary &amp; pay from my RPA Developer job and my RPA company.<br /><br />I build my RPA company in public, meaning I will share everything, even my income. So, for example, for most of 2021, I had an RPA Developer job in a software company, and while nothing in the contract stated that I wasn't allowed to share my salary, I didn't (and none of my colleagues did).<br /><br />When I started my RPA company on December 1, 2021, I knew that the core value should be transparency. That's it. I'll share everything, even my income ($$).<br /><br />So let me share what I earned in 2021 (RPA Developer job + self-employed).<br /><br />Today's guest is Ollie Sulley from Edge Tech. Ollie works with RPA Recruiting and will tell us how to optimize our RPA Developer salaries and answer all your questions.

I'll share my payroll slips and have the RPA Recruiter Ollie Sulley from Edge Tech in the live stream.<br /><br />1:16 My RPA Salary<br />In December 2021, I started my own RPA company, offering consulting and RPA education/content creation. Let me share how the first month went. In the first 11 months of 2021, I worked as an RPA Developer in a Danish software company called Lessor A/S. I was allowed to share my salary but never did (no one did). I think it's a shame because everyone can benefit (both the worker and the company).<br /><br />10:58 Q&amp;A with RPA Recruiter Olli Sulley<br />Ollie Sulley from Edge Tech joins to answer our questions. <br /><br />#rpa #rpadeveloper #developer{% endraw %}
