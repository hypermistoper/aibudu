And we are all glad that there is still more to come,&quot; he said. <br /><br />&quot;Thank you for staying the course. Thank you for continuing to be faithful to the pledges you made 70 years ago. Thank you for showing us how service and faithfulness matter. People of all faiths and none can learn from this.&quot;<br /><br />The service was meant to be a big family reunion, but the ceremony went ahead without the Queen, who was forced to pull out at the last minute.<br /><br />Platinum Jubilee coverage live updates: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2022/06/03/queen-platinum-jubilee-live-news-thanksgiving-service-st-pauls/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/royal-family/2022/06/03/queen-platinum-jubilee-live-news-thanksgiving-service-st-pauls/</a><br /><br />Get the latest headlines: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/">https://www.telegraph.co.uk/</a><br /><br />Telegraph.co.uk and YouTube.com/TelegraphTV are websites of The Telegraph, the UK's best-selling quality daily newspaper providing news and analysis on UK and world events, business, sport, lifestyle and culture.<br /><br />#jubilee #royals #queen #london{% endraw %}
