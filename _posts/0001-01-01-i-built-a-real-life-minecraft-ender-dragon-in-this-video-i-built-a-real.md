Only problem was that this is by far the largest thing that we have ever built and have never built anything involving fire so this could go wrong quickly. This video had lots of ups and downs, but we figured it out and it turned out incredible! This was insane and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. <br /><br />Thanks @TommyInnit <br /><br />If youâ€™re reading this youâ€™re a real one! <br />Comment â€œMinecraft IRL!&quot; so I can notice you!<br /><br />Not Minecraft Speed Run, But Minecraft Statue, But 100 Days, But Realistic Minecraft, But Minecraft World Record, But Minecraft Real Life POV, But Real Hands in Minecraft or any other video like Dream, MrBeast Gaming, Ayundaru, Aphmau, Unspeakable, Preston, MrBeast, Typical Gamer, Stokes Twins, or Airrack would make.
