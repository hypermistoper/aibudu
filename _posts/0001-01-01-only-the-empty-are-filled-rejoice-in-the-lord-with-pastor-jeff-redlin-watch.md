Hunger tells us that we need food. It is only the realization of our need that drives us to the fulfilling of that need. So if we ask ourselves who can be filled with the goodness of God? Well the answer to that is only the empty are filled.<br /><br />When we are filled with ourselves, there is no room for the One who truly should do the filling. But when we come empty, when we come realizing our need, we also come with the hope of leaving filled. Only the empty are filled. May we have come hungry today and may we leave full.{% endraw %}
