{% raw %}Someone suggested I watch this video of Dr. Jordan Peterson discussing the meaning of music. I'm aware some of you may not like him, some of you may admire him - this video is about his take on music only and I think it's an interesting conversation. I haven't watched any of Jordan's work before this, so I'm reacting only to what is being said here. Some of you may disagree with me, others may agree, that's the beauty of music. I'm not trying to criticise Dr. Jordan, I'm just trying to understand this point of view in contrast to my own. <br /><br />What do you think the meaning of music is? Is it even possible to define what music is and how it makes us feel? Is there something magical about music that cannot be explained? Please, I'd love to know your thoughts on this, comment below and if possible watch the video in full first so we're all on the same page!<br /><br />My Patreon (it's excellent): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.patreon.com/jushawk">http://www.patreon.com/jushawk</a><br />- Group Zoom Calls<br />- Live Stream Podcast<br />- One-on-One Lessons or Chat <br />- My private demos and music no one else is allowed to hear<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/justinhawkinsta">http://www.instagram.com/justinhawkinsta</a><br />Merch Store:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thejawsofvictory.com/">https://thejawsofvictory.com/</a><br />Cameo: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins">https://www.cameo.com/justinhawkins</a><br /><br />I'm on tour in the USA &amp; Canada with The Darkness this year - get tickets here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.thedarknesslive.com/tour-dates/">https://www.thedarknesslive.com/tour-dates/</a><br /><br />#JordanPeterson #Music #JustinHawkins{% endraw %}
