{% raw %}Today was the first qualifying session, Newcomers (Speed Control Lap) followed by the Superbike, Superstock &amp; Supersport Qualifying other bikes ran but I didn’t stay to watch them.<br />We also got to see the side cars which was a treat as they followed the speed control lap.<br />If you make it to the end, you deserve a pint! but this is long as I wanted you to see what it’s like to be stood in a hedge, shoulder to shoulder with total strangers, Manx radio playing all around you with live commentary, the murmur of people chatting, the chirping of birds and then the whine of the bikes in the distance as they speed towards you.<br />After 2 hours we were frozen! Don’t be fooled by the blue sky and sunshine, the wind was straight off the sea and very chilly so we headed into Peel and had a late lunch.<br /><br />Please consider subscribing so you know when there is a new video out.{% endraw %}
