Things like: meditation, healthy eating, and unconditional self-love.<br />I managed to cure a skin disorder despite being told it wasn’t possible.<br />I am so excited for you all to watch this. <br />And remember to share it with someone who you think it might help.<br /><br />You can recommend it for anyone and everyone.<br />Female.<br />Male.<br />Young.<br />Oldie.<br /><br />You can help all skin types and all skin conditions.<br />Eczema.<br />Dermatitis.<br />Psoriasis.<br />Acne.<br />Aging.<br />Dullness.<br />Lack of hydration.<br />Pigmentation.<br />Sensitivity.<br />Fine lines.<br />Wrinkles.<br />Uneven skin tones. <br /><br />You name it!<br /><br />Here is a guide for you to select the best oils for your specific skin type:<br /><br />Dry skin: Avacado Oil, Apricot Oil, Hazel Nut Oil, Shea Nut, Sea Buckthorn Oil, Olive Oil, Sweet Almond Oil.<br />Oily Skin: Hemp Oil, Evening Primrose, Pumpkin Seed Oil, Grapeseed Oil, Rosehip Seed Oil, Soy Bean Oil.<br />Balanced Skin: Jojoba Oil, Flax Seed Oil, Tamanu Oil, Argan Oil, Coconut Unrefined Oil.<br /><br />For specific skin conditions:<br />Use essential oils. Be sure to do your research before using essential oils, as they are more concentrated and some can be harmful when ingested or over applied. So be careful.<br /><br />Remember to do your research and go in with a positive mindset.<br />You’re halfway there. <br /><br />If you have any allergies, stop using the oils and definitely look for a great Naturopath and/or Ayurvedic doctor in your area.
