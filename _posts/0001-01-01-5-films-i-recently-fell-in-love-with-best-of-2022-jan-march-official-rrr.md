Talking about some of my favourite films from the 1st quarter of 2022...what would you add to this list?<br /><br /><br />About:<br />By day, Raunaq Mangottil is the co-founder of Fully Filmy (fullyfilmy.in), an Indian Pop Culture Brand born in Chennai in 2015. Also by day extending into the night, Raunaq creates content around movies/shows, books, entrepreneurship among other things. And at different times of the day, Raunaq catches himself writing about himself in third-person and feels awkward.{% endraw %}
