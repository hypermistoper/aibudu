{% raw %}In 2020, the number of people aged 60 and above rose to 1 billion, almost 15% of the worldâ€™s population. And this proportion is growing, as people live longer.<br /> <br />In the same week that the United Nations General Assembly declared 2021-2030 the Decade of Healthy Ageing, WHO released the Baseline report for the Decade of Healthy Ageing, which provides a snapshot of where we are in 2020 and where we aim to be by 2030.
