{% raw %}The United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres has condemned war in Ukraine as evil. On his first visit since the invasion, the UN chief inspected the damage inflicted by Russian attacks. Guterres was in Russia earlier, where he secured an agreement in principle for the evacuation of civilians trapped in Mariupol. <br /><br />Several countries and organizations, including the UN, have vowed to bring to justice any perpetrators of war crimes committed during Russia's invasion. Key players pushing for accountability for atrocities met informally at the UN on Wednesday. There, Ukraine's prosecutor general said via video link that she had already opened more than 8,000 investigations into alleged violations. <br /><br />Please be aware that the following report contains distressing images.<br />_<br />00:00 UN Secretary General in Ukraine<br />04:29 Ukraine investigates potential war crimes <br />07:39 Prosecutor Iryna Venediktova on charges against Russia <br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />For more news go to: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dw.com/en/">http://www.dw.com/en/</a><br />Follow DW on social media:<br />►Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/">https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/</a><br />►Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/dwnews">https://twitter.com/dwnews</a><br />►Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dwnews">https://www.instagram.com/dwnews</a><br />Für Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch">https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch</a><br />#Ukraine #UnitedNations #Guterres{% endraw %}
