{% raw %}Writing papers and giving talks are key skills for any researcher, but they aren’t easy. In this pair of presentations, I’ll describe simple guidelines that I follow for writing papers and giving talks, which I think may be useful to you too. I don’t have all the answers-far from it-and I hope that the presentation will evolve into a discussion in which you share your own insights, rather than a lecture.{% endraw %}
