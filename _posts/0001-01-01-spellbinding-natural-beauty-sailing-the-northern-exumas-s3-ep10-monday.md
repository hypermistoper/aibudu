{% raw %}The Exumas. This is what this trip has always been about. How to get to that picture postcard beautiful water. In this episode we finally sail to our first stops in the Exuma islands - Highborn Cay, Allens Cay, Shroud Cay, and Warderick Wells. The water, the scenery, and the amazing creatures that we can see from our boat do not disappoint. Relax and sail with us to places that previously we only visited in our dreams.{% endraw %}
