{% raw %}Since the crisis between Russia and the United States over Ukraine erupted, India has refrained from taking sides. <br />External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar got phone calls from British Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and the European Union's High Representative for Foreign Affairs Josep Borrell Fontelles, both of whom reportedly urged New Delhi to firmly denounce Russia's military attack on Ukraine. New Delhi, on the other hand, maintained its cautious stance. Jaishankar described the situation in Ukraine as &quot;grave,&quot; but he did not denounce Russia.<br />India simply noted the increase of tensions between the two European states at the UN emergency meeting and urged all parties to display &quot;utmost caution.&quot;<br />The Russian chargé d'affaires, Roman Babushkin, described India's stance as &quot;independent and balanced.&quot;, while Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi did call on Russian President Vladimir Putin to put a stop to the violence there.<br />With pressure mounting, from the Western bloc, led by the United States, this is a test for New Delhi, to make a strategic decision, — ideals and values, on one side, pragmatism and interests, on the other.{% endraw %}
