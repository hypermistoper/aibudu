{% raw %}That's a lot of pizza! 40,000lbs worth in trailer flips on freeway - heavy rescue. Not often you get to work with pizza on the freeway! This call came in as a trailer with 40,000lbs of meat overturned on a transition on the freeway. Turned out to be 40,000lb of pizza, packaged in individual boxes on its way to the stores. <br /><br />This was a CHALLENGING job, for a few reasons. The obvious one is trailers, unlike containers, are very weak. You can't man handle them with brute strength because the walls aren't made of steel or a strong composite. In fact, the front of this trailer ripped during the fall, which decreased the structural integrity. You can try to upright these with bags, but in this case, that would have taken far too long to call them in, and set them up. Dave and I have experience in this and knew we could do it with just our trucks and some clever rigging. <br /><br />To start, we tried to use as many points of contact with our straps as possible to &quot;cradle&quot; the load. I started with two 30' straps in the rear, doubled up into 4 parts. Dave used my special 2' wide straps up front where it was most damaged. We also used angle irons and wood to help everything come up without further tearing. The plan worked, as it came over nicely. <br /><br />The load on the other hand was badly shifted, as most of these rollovers tend to be. We tried to tow it off the freeway to work in a better environment, but the load was not safe enough to complete the sharp turn on this overpass, so we had to work it there. Our crew kicked some butt and got to work quick to do this process as fast as possible. Once emptied and loaded into the new trailer, all lanes were open on our way we went. <br /><br />►All footage was shot with my Sony FX3 using a Sony 24-105mm F4.0 lens.
