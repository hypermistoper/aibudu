This video begins with a brief history of the origin of the Functional Behavior Assessment and its ties to applied behavior analysis, ABA therapy. Throughout the video, the functional behavior assessment, fba, will be discussed along with behavior intervention and behavior support plans. The functional behavioral assessment is just one part of a larger behavior support system. The video makes several mentions of the importance of a behavior support team. It goes on to describe who should comprise the behavior support team. Further more, the video provides a step by step process for implementing a functional behavioral assessment. Each step in the fba offers various strategies for teachers, behaviorists, educators, paraprofessionals, administrators and other. This video also part of a larger playlist on behavior intervention plans.{% endraw %}
