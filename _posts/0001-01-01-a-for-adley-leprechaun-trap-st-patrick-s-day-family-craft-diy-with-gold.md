We have made leprechaun traps for so many years, and each year those stinky St. Patrick's Day troll escape with our chocolate gold! Well this year Me, Niko, Mom, and Dad are going to make our best traps yet! We started with a shoe box that we cut a hole in the top of. So the first step is to decorate the box with some crafts so that the leprechaun doesn't know that it is a trap. Me and Mom put some jewels and gems on our box, then we colored the hole thing green. We also put a GiANT RAiNBOW SLiDE on the side, so he will want to climb the box to go down the slide! Niko and Dad put a paper pterodactyl on their box which looked really cool! Then we both put a BUNCH of slime in the bottom of our boxes so that the leprechaun's feet would get stuck when he climbs in the box. I REALLY REALLY hope that we catch a leprechaun this year, and I hope that you do to! We made a bunch of fun craft cutouts that you can use on your traps!
