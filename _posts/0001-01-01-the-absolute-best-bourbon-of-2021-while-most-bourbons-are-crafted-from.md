{% raw %}While most bourbons are crafted from corn and other grain such as rye, wheat, and malted barley, it takes a great deal of expertise and flair to transform these ingredients into a top-shelf tipple. And, despite what your whiskey-loving friends might tell you, while 95% of bourbon is produced in Kentucky, the amber liquor can be distilled anywhere in the U.S. without losing its bourbon status. That means that the best of the best has a long road to climb to the top of the bourbon mountain.
