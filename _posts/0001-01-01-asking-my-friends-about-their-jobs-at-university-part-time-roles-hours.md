{% raw %}Having worked in various part time jobs throughout the whole duration of my time at university so far, I've experienced many of the benefits of working but also many of the downsides of having more commitments than the average student. Today I've roped in the help of some of my friends to talk to you about their part time jobs, how much they earn, why they have them and how they got them! I hope you find these videos useful and if you have any questions about working at university, feel free to leave them in the comments and I'll get back to you!<br />Contact Details:<br />Tom: @personalstatementsupport or personalstatementhelps@gmail.com<br />Eirlys: @eirlysherring_<br />Maddie: @_maddieherring<br />Jack: @jackshuldham<br />I (try to) upload roughly once a week.
