{% raw %}3M (MMM)<br />For several years now it has been almost impossible to find dividend growth stocks with impeccable quality at reasonable prices.  However, that has recently changed as Dividend Aristocrat and Champion 3M (MMM) has become attractively valued.  This is the first time since March 2020 after the Covid instigated flash crash, and only the second time since the end of July, beginning of August 2011.<br /><br />Previously, I posted videos on 3M doing both those previous timeframes mentioned above when the stock became reasonably valued.  Here are links to those 2 videos:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E_LfjJ9q48">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6E_LfjJ9q48</a> <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJrIx9sxhQ4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJrIx9sxhQ4</a><br /><br />In this video I elaborate and corroborate on how buying valuation generated great returns at lower risk.  I will also introduce a new feature that we intend to go live with soon which also illustrates how 3M is more physically fit than the majority of companies in its subindustry group.<br /><br />3M is a Dividend King, Dividend Aristocrat, and Dividend Champion that has increased their dividend for 64 consecutive years, one of the longest streaks of all dividend growth stocks.  If above average income, safety, and total return or your objectives, then 3M is a no-brainer of a choice.<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to our YouTube channel<br /><br />Try FAST Graphs for FREE Today! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.fastgraphs.com">https://www.fastgraphs.com</a> <br /><br />#investing #dividend #stocks{% endraw %}
