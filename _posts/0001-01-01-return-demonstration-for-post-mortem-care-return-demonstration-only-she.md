{% raw %}~return demonstration only, she's not dead <br />~1st year student<br />~its a blanket not a real shroud thats why i found it hard folding it<br /><br />p.s. sorry for the demo i know it wasnt perfect but i tried my best and we arent allowed to edit our videos, we need 1 take only and ayoko ng mag another takes sa video kasi wala na akong ibang extra materials and i only have 1 chance to take this. i hope for your understanding :) u can watch other post mortem care return demonstrations for  better references :)) thank you!{% endraw %}
