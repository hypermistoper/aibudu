{% raw %}Why the Island on Aircraft Carriers is Mostly on the Starboard Side?<br /><br />Have you ever noticed that almost all aircraft carriers have their island on the starboard side?  Williamson first proposed the idea of an aircraft carrier with an island and a form of arresting gear in 1915 for HMS Argus. In his detailed designs, Williamson placed the island on the starboard side because Single-Engine Piston Aircraft had a natural swing to the left side (port side). The propeller of most of the engines, at that time and even now, rotate clockwise with respect to the pilot’s position, and the torque effect generated by the propeller makes the body of the plane swing to port. Pilots have to counter this effect, particularly during the take-offs and landings.<br /><br />Hence Flying Officer Williamson’s design had the island on the starboard side as it was logical for an approaching aircraft to circle in from the left, and during touchdown, if it failed to arrest, to fly off to the left (due to the natural swing of the aircraft to port). Unfortunately, Royal Navy rejected his idea. The first full-deck aircraft carrier, HMS Argus, was completed in 1918 without a superstructure. As Royal Navy’s experience with Furious, which, in her original carrier configuration, had an immense superstructure in the centre of the flight deck, showed that turbulence was a significant problem for landing aircraft.<br /><br />Make sure to share this video with your friends!
