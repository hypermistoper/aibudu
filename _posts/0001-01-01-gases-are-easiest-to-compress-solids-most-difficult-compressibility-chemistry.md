{% raw %}This demonstration uses some common objects to illustrate a simple, but important point. Squeezing a piece of chalk or block of wood does not alter its size or shape appreciably. Compressing water in a syringe reduces its volume very little, but enough to get visual confirmation. However air in a syringe compresses significantly more than water. Gas, liquid and solid are compressible in increasing order of difficulty, with gases being the easiest to compress and solids being the most difficult. This is because the intermolecular distance between gas molecules is large, creating small intermolecular forces while intermolecular distance between solids is small, creating large intermolecular forces.{% endraw %}
