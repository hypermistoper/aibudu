{% raw %}We jumped on a plane with our 2 kids and flew to Los ￼Angeles, California to see my sister Jinger &amp; her hubs Jeremy! The kids did great on the flight over and we had the best time catching up, sightseeing and adventuring around LA &amp; Hollywood! After 5 days we were ready to be home, but sad to leave!!{% endraw %}
