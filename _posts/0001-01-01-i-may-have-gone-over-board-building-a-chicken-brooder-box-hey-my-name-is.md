{% raw %}Hey, My name is Tom.  I don't know about you but I find myself wanting to DO everything myself.  Wheather I should or not.  I consider myself a Jack Of All Trades.  Master of none.  What you'll find here will be anything from building or fixing cars or trucks, building or remodeling projects and everything in between.  I get myself into some pretty interesting situations.  <br /><br />I'd love it if you subscribed so we can stay in touch...  You might even learn something.  I know I will! <br /><br />Thank you for watching!!<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.Instagram.com/RustyJudgment">http://www.Instagram.com/RustyJudgment</a><br />Email: Tom@RustyJudgment.com<br /><br />Rusty Judgment<br />PO Box 159<br />Elko New Market, MN 55020<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/freemusicforvlogs/mbb-feel-good-free-music-for-vlogs?utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing">https://soundcloud.com/freemusicforvlogs/mbb-feel-good-free-music-for-vlogs?utm_source=clipboard&amp;utm_medium=text&amp;utm_campaign=social_sharing</a>{% endraw %}
