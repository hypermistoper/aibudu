{% raw %}In this SMRT Leiden 2020 Online Virtual Event presentation, Ida Hoijer of Uppsala University shares her research on developing a long-read sequencing-based method for detection of CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects, along with a customized analysis pipeline. By applying an off-target sequencing (OTS) method on a human embryonic cell line, they detected 55 on- and off-target sites for three different gRNAs, including allele-specific off-targets. As the OTS approach finds off-targets that are difficult to predict using in silico or short-read based methods, it may become an important tool for genome editing. <br />Learn more about PacBio at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pacb.com/">https://pacb.com/</a><br />Legal &amp; Trademarks: Visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pacb.com/legal-and-trademarks/">https://www.pacb.com/legal-and-trademarks/</a>{% endraw %}
