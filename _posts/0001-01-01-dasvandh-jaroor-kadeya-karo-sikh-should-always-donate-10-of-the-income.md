{% raw %}90% yours and 10% is mine !! That's what our Gurus have taught to all Sikhs! Every Sikh household should try to set aside at least 10% of their income for good cause. This cause can be for helping the poor, feeding the needy or towards the education of the under privileged kids or simply donating it to a charitable organization or a religious organization! But why should we donate 10% of our income? To get an accurate answer, please listen to this beautiful Katha by Bhai Pinderpal Singh Ji !! Please feel free to share and subscribe !! WaheGuru Ji !!<br />- Raj Karega Khalsa Team{% endraw %}
