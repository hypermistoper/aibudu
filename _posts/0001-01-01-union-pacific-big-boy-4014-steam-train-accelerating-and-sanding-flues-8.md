{% raw %}READ THIS DESCRIPTION FIRST BEFORE COMMENTING:<br />Working HARD on the Big Boy 2021 Tour: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IBZvoWsb0">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t0IBZvoWsb0</a><br />EDIT: Thanks for making this hit ONE MILLION views!<br /><br />Supercut of the two best pacing shots from this date. Accelerating out of Walnut Ridge, AR and sanding the flues just south of Knobel, AR. Speed towards the end of the video is approaching 45 MPH. Enjoy =)<br /><br />FAQ (READ):<br />Oil burning locomotives must have their flues and tubes &quot;sanded&quot; every few dozen miles because any oil that does not fully combust in the firebox will end up coating said tubes and flues and hinder heat transfer to the boiler. When the locomotive is working hard, a heavy draft is induced from the firebox, through the tubes and flues to the smokebox and out the stack. The sand that is poured through the firebox peep hole in the cab is sucked through the tubes and flues and scours them clean of the oil deposits, hence the short periods of black exhaust.<br /><br />The diesel locomotive accompanies UP Steam power to provide a measure of security and flexibility in operations. The diesel can hold or slow the train speed down using dynamic braking, thus saving the cost of new brake shoes and the time needed to install them. Additionally, the diesel can be used to assist when necessary, and to extended the fuel and water supply, allowing for longer operating distances and days. Finally, as of 2021, the diesel is an integral part of the PTC system required for FRA compliance.<br /><br />The water overflow from just in front of the rear cylinder on the fireman's side is the exhaust steam injector overflow port. Discharge from this port is normal when starting and stopping the injector.<br /><br />Arkansas pacing: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeUINRGWDJw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AeUINRGWDJw</a><br /><br />Working steam in Texas &amp; Arkansas: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sccj_YFsuRE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sccj_YFsuRE</a><br /><br />Climbing out of St. Louis: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duNwItW9waM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=duNwItW9waM</a><br /><br />0:00 - Accelerating out of Walnut Ridge<br />4:16 - Sanding the flues (40-45 MPH)<br />5:00 - Cruising (45 MPH){% endraw %}
