{% raw %}Dr. Shabir Ally says the Quran mentions magic, usually in reference to people disbelieving the prophets and claiming they were doing magic. When Moses' staff changes into a serpent, Muslims understand this to mean that it was God's intervention and only appeared to be magic. He looks at the 113th chapter of the Quran, which mentions protection against those who blow on knots, and he questions an account that the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) was a victim of black magic. He concludes that Muslims should not ascribe power to supernatural forces other than God, and he advises Muslims to adopt a scientific mind in line with the Quranic message.<br /><br />If you enjoy this video, please support our work financially by visiting our website <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.quranspeaks.com">http://www.quranspeaks.com</a> or sending an etransfer to igive@quranspeaks.com <br /><br />► DONATE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.quranspeaks.com/">http://www.quranspeaks.com/</a><br />► SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=quranspeaks">https://www.youtube.com/subscription_center?add_user=quranspeaks</a><br /><br />COMMENT, LIKE and SHARE<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.Facebook.com/LetTheQuranSpeak">http://www.Facebook.com/LetTheQuranSpeak</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.Instagram.com/QuranSpeaks.tv">http://www.Instagram.com/QuranSpeaks.tv</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.Twitter.com/Quran_Speaks">http://www.Twitter.com/Quran_Speaks</a>{% endraw %}
