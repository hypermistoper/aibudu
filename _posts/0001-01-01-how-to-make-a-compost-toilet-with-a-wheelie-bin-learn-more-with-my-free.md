For a wheelie bin toilet, begin by drilling a hole at the bottom of the bin to attach a ball valve that will allow you to drain any surplus liquid from the bin. A filter can be created with a piece of pipe and some shade cloth fitted inside the bin, opposite the exterior valve.<br /><br />In order to aerate the compost, measure the corners of the wheelie bin and cut a typical pipe in half to fit in the corners of the bin. The pipe should also have slits cut every few centimetres to allow air to reach the compost at all levels. Then, the pipe can be strapped into the corners of the bin.<br /><br />Next, cut a piece of metal grill to fit within the pipes down to the bottom of the bin. That should be wrapped in a piece of shade cloth at least twice.<br /><br />Then, get a second lid and cut a hole in it to allow the waste delivery pipe through. When the bin is full, the original lid will be used to seal it up for composting, and a new wheelie bin will be the active compost bin.<br /><br />This is one of the most ethical ways to make a compost toilet that is safe and efficient with sensible materials. In less than a year, it turns humanure into a valuable commodity.<br /><br />Key Takeaways:<br /><br />• Dry composting toilets are a safe, efficient way to handle human waste, and they can easily be made with upcycled materials.<br />• A wheelie bin toilet needs a valve at the bottom to drain away any excess liquid.<br />• It needs slotted pipes moving vertically along the corners and a metal grate along the bottom to aid with aeration.<br />• The bin should keep its original top to seal off the full compost bin, while a second lid should be fitted to allow a waste delivery pipe into the bin.<br />• This is an ethical way to handle human waste with sensible materials.<br /><br />Support us in making more films by:<br /><br />► Signing up to our newsletter and the Permaculture Circle—my curated collection of 100+ free videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://start.geofflawtononline.com/permaculturecircle/">https://start.geofflawtononline.com/permaculturecircle/</a><br />► Liking us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/geofflawtononline/">https://www.facebook.com/geofflawtononline/</a><br />► Following us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/geofflawtononline/">https://www.instagram.com/geofflawtononline/</a><br />► Subscribing to our Youtube channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_r1ELEvAuN0peKUxI0Umw/?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL_r1ELEvAuN0peKUxI0Umw/?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />About Geoff:<br /><br />Geoff is a world-renowned permaculture consultant, designer, and teacher. He has established permaculture demonstration sites that function as education centers in all the world’s extreme climates — information on the success of these systems is networked through the Permaculture Research Institute and the www.permaculturenews.org website.<br /><br />About Permaculture: <br /><br />Permaculture (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permaculture)</a> integrates land, resources, people and the environment through mutually beneficial synergies – imitating the no waste, closed loop systems seen in diverse natural systems. Permaculture applies holistic solutions that are applicable in rural and urban contexts and at any scale. It is a multidisciplinary toolbox including agriculture, water harvesting and hydrology, energy, natural building, forestry, waste management, animal systems, aquaculture, appropriate technology, economics, and community development.<br /><br />#permaculture #composttoilet #humanure{% endraw %}
