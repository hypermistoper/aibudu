{% raw %}Child SCREAMS for 8 Hours on Flight | #Childfree &amp; Judging Parents<br /><br />Today is another rant video connected to my Q&amp;A. One questions asked what are my pet peeves, what annoys me, what offends me? I simply said open mouth eaters, heavy breathers, people who don't train their dogs and people who don't discipline their kids and let them go crazy in public. Some parents had issue that I'm childfree and said that I'm &quot;judging&quot; parents.  So you all are going to tell me you are such great parents you can't admit that a child (or anyone) screaming repeatedly in public isn't the slightest bit annoying?? I found a story of a child who screams for 8 hours on a flight. I would definitely be very annoyed if I had to deal with someone constantly screaming in a small space, but I guess that makes me a judgmental person! lol <br /><br />Second channel! <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/FOwnP7I0sbQ">https://youtu.be/FOwnP7I0sbQ</a><br /><br />Instagram<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/michelle_mcdaniel/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/michelle_mcdaniel/?hl=en</a><br /><br />Protein donuts- 10g of protein <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://prodoughbakery.com/">https://prodoughbakery.com/</a><br /><br />Support group/12 week gym program/Fat burning program/ MY LOVE (LOL) <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://michellemcdaniel.net/products/weight-loss-support-group">https://michellemcdaniel.net/products/weight-loss-support-group</a>{% endraw %}
