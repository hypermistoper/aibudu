{% raw %}There are 37 species of canine contained within the Canidae clade; 15 species of wild dog and 22 species of fox. These animals are split into three groups; wolf-like canines, South American canines and fox-like canines. In this guide, we'll explore every species of canine with the exception of foxes, which we'll cover in a later video. This includes wolves, jackals, wild dogs and a few odd stragglers such as the bush dog and the racoon dog. These animals are the closest relatives to the domesticated dog and are found in every ecozone on earth.
