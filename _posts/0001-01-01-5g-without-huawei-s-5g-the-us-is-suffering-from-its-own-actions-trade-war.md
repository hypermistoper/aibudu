{% raw %}#Huawei's5G#TradeWar# Americanhegemony<br /><br />Hi everyone, welcome to Hot Topics Time. Hot topics Channel selects 1-2 topics every day, interprets news from a new perspective, and explore the wisdom behind the news. Before we start today’s video, please subscribe to our channel, which is the encouragement that we can create more videos. OK, let’s take a look at the topic we are going to talk about today.  <br /><br />Since the US government added Huawei to the entity list, it has been criticized by netizens from all over the world, because everyone understands that there is no so-called network security, it is just because the US is afraid that China's 5G technology will surpass them, and will take the big market away from the US. After all, a British executive publicly admitted in January that they had placed intelligence officers inside Huawei, concluding that there was no security issue with Huawei's technical equipment. Even so, the United States still vigorously rejects Huawei 5G and is even prepared to dismantle its 5G base stations at all costs. But what is the result? There have been several news in the United States recently, which are the bad results of the United States' rejection of Huawei's 5G. Well, what’s the news? As the world’s technology powerhouse, why is the US now lagging behind a Chinese private enterprise? Since the bad results of rejecting Huawei's 5G have appeared, is there any possibility for the United States to accept Huawei's 5G in the future? OK, we are going to talk about that in today’s video.{% endraw %}
