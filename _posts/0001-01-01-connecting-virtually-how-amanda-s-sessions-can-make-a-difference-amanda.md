{% raw %}Amanda Gore  has been an international speaker for 35 years and is a master of  group dynamics and the process of communicating which allows her to work live or virtually with any size group. Her content is memorable -  which allow the messages to embed and stick with audiences. She regularly has people contacting her saying they heard her speak 20 years ago and they can quote verbatim parts of what was said and share how they have integrated it into their lives, their companies and their personal lives.<br /><br />Currently, the vast majority of our clients are dealing with the same issues - stress, zoom fatigue, disconnection, disengagement, change fatigue, social isolation, loss of a sense of belonging, uncertainty, balancing or juggling conflicting personal and professional responsibilities and so much more. What they want is an exciting, energetic and engaging virtual presentation that still delivers useful and transforming content.<br /><br />Depending on what your needs are, she has hundreds of ‘chunks’ of information that can be mixed and matched to achieve your outcome and pull the group together even if they are all remote.<br /><br />People are yearning for encouragement, connection and a sense of belonging as well as new ways to deal with the new ways of doing business.<br /><br />They still need to learn how to feel good about themselves, manage themselves and manage relationships in a new world.  Emotional regulation is a critical skill to develop. And it has an instant flow on to relationships which are the basis of all business.<br /><br />This short virtual session was tailored for a Austbook Australia, it demonstrates how Amanda presents engaging, entertaining and relevant content that has audiences asking for more...<br /><br />To make her virtual presentations as effective as her live ones, Amanda has a professional quality studio set up and specialises on ‘personally’ connecting through the camera. She has taught people in the past how to be engaging and lively on video so she knows how to make a virtual presentation or pre record appear live – and how to really connect with individuals or groups watching via video – using the principles of quantum physics and group dynamics.<br /><br /> *** Have an event coming up - please contact magic@amandagore.com or visit www.amandagore.com we would love to discuss how Amanda can help you! ***{% endraw %}
