{% raw %}The vertical bow that characterizes the E26 Classic profile shows from the first glance the classic and sporty character of the boat.<br />The profile of the boat and the pilot station promise sportiness, while the feeling of well-being on board is enhanced by refined and elegant details.<br />There are strong references to tradition such as the teak bow deck which recalls the classic heritage of wooden boats and acts as a visual counterpoint to the aft deck also covered in teak. And there is certainly no shortage of innovative and functional solutions.{% endraw %}
