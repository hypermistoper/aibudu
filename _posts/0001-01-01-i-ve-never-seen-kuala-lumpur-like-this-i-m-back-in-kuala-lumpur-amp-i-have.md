{% raw %}I´m back in Kuala Lumpur &amp; I have never seen Malaysia like this!<br />Previous video from the Ramadan bazaar ➡ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/u9P5Donu01Q">https://youtu.be/u9P5Donu01Q</a><br /><br />Although I spent a few months in Kuala Lumpur in 2020, I never saw the city fully alive. There were always lockdowns and restrictions while I was in Malaysia back in 2020. This time Kuala Lumpur feels very different! Join me on a walk around Chinatown Kuala Lumpur, the famous Petaling street, where we meet up with Jesslyn to get some food. Having a local with me here in Chinatown Kuala Lumpur definitely helps to get a better experience in Kuala Lumpur!<br /><br />Location of restaurant where we ate<br />➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/db5Bie1AJDBKNuq78">https://goo.gl/maps/db5Bie1AJDBKNuq78</a><br />#malaysia #travelmalaysia #kualalumpur <br />---------------------------------------- <br />🙋🏼‍♂️A B O U T M E <br />I am Ken Abroad, a full-time traveler traveling southeast Asia, currently in Sri Lanka, making Sri Lanka travel vlogs. It is my goal here on this channel to visit every country in southeast Asia and bring you along the journey. <br />You won’t see much tourist places in my videos, I rather like to show the “real” sides of each country in my videos. Where do the local people go to eat? Where do they hang out? How do the locals travel through the country? Stuff like that. <br />There will be almost daily uploads on this channel, during the next months from Sri Lanka. I will be traveling Sri Lanka, showing you around local places and try lots of different Sri Lankan food. Join the journey if you are interested in experiencing Sri Lanka now from a more authentic local point of view.  <br />Click here to subscribe and follow my trip around southeast Asia <br />➡️<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2A2GheP">https://bit.ly/2A2GheP</a><br />---------------------------------------- <br />📷 I N S T A G R A M <br />Check also my Instagram, where I post pictures regularly, daily stories &amp; lots of behind-the-scenes stuff: @Ken__abroad <br />➡️ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ken__abroad/">https://www.instagram.com/ken__abroad/</a><br />---------------------------------------- <br />📗 M Y T R A V E L G U I D E  E-B O O K<br />I wrote a Thailand travel guide E-book with over 100 pages full with travel tips and recommended places all around Thailand.
