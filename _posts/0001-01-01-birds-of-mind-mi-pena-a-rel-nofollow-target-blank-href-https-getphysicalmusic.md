It was full of deep, spiritual, emotional sounds and is now followed up with a trio of top singles. Between this pair they have studied filmmaking in NYC and violin and piano at the Conservatory of Paris and travel the world picking up disparate influences and inspiration from nature. All of that infuses this first richly detailed new cut. <br /><br />'Mi Pena' is a gloriously lush house tune lit up with sensuous synth strings. They bring a sense of class as the drums roll deep and vocals slowly emerge to bring the soul. It's a track that will ignite cosy crowds and intimate dance floors with its mix of elastic groove and heart warming atmosphere. <br /><br />This single is the start of another standout year for Birds of Mind. <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.getphysicalmusic.com/">http://www.getphysicalmusic.com/</a>{% endraw %}
