{% raw %}Josh Wilson - Things That I'm Afraid Of (Official Audio)<br /><br />LYRICS: <br />When I am shaking<br />And my heart′s pounding<br />You always take me<br />Make me lay down in<br />Peaceful fields where<br />I can clear my head<br /> <br />'Cause I get so overcome with anxiety<br />Like there’s an enemy living inside of me<br />Like a mocker yelling out telling lies to me<br />And I don't feel brave, but I don't have to be ‘cause <br /> <br />I walked through the valley of shadows<br />And it scared me half to death<br />But You′re with me everywhere I go<br />So I won't give up yet<br />My fears would surely kill me <br />If I didn’t know the truth<br />The things that I'm afraid of are afraid of You<br /> <br />When my emotions <br />Turn against me<br />Not faith nor reason <br />Could convince me that<br />You have patience <br />Left to fight for me<br /> <br />When my depression is affecting every ounce of me<br />I can get the medication and the counseling<br />Still, I can hear the fear calling out to me<br />And I don′t feel brave, but I don't have to be ‘cause<br /> <br />I walked through the valley of shadows<br />And it scared me half to death<br />But You′re with me everywhere I go<br />So I won't give up yet<br />My fears would surely kill me <br />If I didn’t know the truth<br />The things that I'm afraid of are afraid of You<br /> <br />You prepare a table for me<br />Right in front of my worst enemies<br />You're as calm and relaxed as can be<br /> <br />There′s no place where my <br />Demons can’t find me, but<br />Just wait ′til they see who’s <br />Standing behind me<br /> <br />I walked through the valley of shadows<br />And it scared me half to death<br />But You′re with me everywhere I go<br />So I won't give up yet<br />My fears would surely kill me <br />If I didn’t know the truth<br />The things that I'm afraid of are afraid of You<br /> <br />The things that I'm afraid of are afraid of You<br />The things that I'm afraid of are afraid of You<br /><br />#JoshWilson #ThingsImAfraidOf<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://vevo.ly/nGHQZR">http://vevo.ly/nGHQZR</a>{% endraw %}
