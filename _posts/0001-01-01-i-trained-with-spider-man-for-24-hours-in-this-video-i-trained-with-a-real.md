In a previous video I Hired 50 Real Life Spider-Man to find out what it is like to be a superhero, but it didnâ€™t give me the experience I was looking for. So in this video I finally live out my childhood dreams by training with Spiderman! Me and my friend Ghoulz hired Nicholas Coolridge aka the Modern Tarzan to train us to become real life superheroes. The stunts that he had us do were insane, but the public was amazed at how cool they were! To top things off, I Actually Climbed A Building Like Spiderman! This was extremely difficult and super intense to make, but we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next!<br /><br />If youâ€™re reading this youâ€™re a real one! <br />Comment â€˜â€™Spidermen Unite!&quot; so I can notice you!<br /><br />Not No Way Home, But the Amazing Spider-Man, But Marvel Universe, But I Hired 50 Real Life Spider-Man!, But I Actually Climbed A Building Like Spiderman!, But Hire 50 Bodyguards, But Hired 100 FAKE Paparazzi, But 100 Myths, But 100 Fears, But 24 Hours, or any other video that Airrack, Sony, MCU, MrBeast, Michelle Khare, Hyper, MoreJStu, Stokes Twins, Unspeakable, Dangie Bros, Ryan Prunty, or Ben Azelart would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10) trains with Spider-Man (aka Modern Tarzan) to find out what itâ€™s like to become a real life superhero.{% endraw %}
