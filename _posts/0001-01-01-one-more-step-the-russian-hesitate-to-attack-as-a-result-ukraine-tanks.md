{% raw %}One more step: The Russian hesitate to attack! As a result, Ukraine tanks are superior to Russian.<br /><br />The Russian army has massed around 1,200 tanks for a possible invasion of Ukraine. The tanks include the latest T-90s plus upgraded T-72s.<br />Across the border, the Ukrainian army has mobilized its own armor for a possible defensive campaign. Ukraine possesses some of the same tank models that Russia does, but Kiev’s best tank—an updated T-64—is uniquely Ukrainian.<br />In Soviet doctrine, which the Russian and Ukrainian armies both follow, tanks rarely fight tanks. But if and when Russia overtly invades Ukraine and sharply escalates the seven-year, frozen conflict in eastern Ukraine, tanks on both sides will play key roles in offense and defense, helping to shape the battlefield so that the decisive force—artillery—can do its terrible work.<br /><br />#Russian #Ukraine #Nato #US #RussianWarUkraine #News #Tanks{% endraw %}
