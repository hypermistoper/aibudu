{% raw %}What is actually the difference between a dependent sample and an independent sample (paired or unpaired samples)? And why is it important to know the difference? Whether the data are from a dependent or independent sample determines which hypothesis test is used.<br /><br />If your data are independent, for example, a t-test for independent samples is calculated or an analysis of variance without repeated measures. If your data are dependent, for example, a t-test for dependent samples or an ANOVA with measurement repetitions is calculated.<br /><br />The online statistics calculator:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://datatab.net/statistics-calculator/hypothesis-test">https://datatab.net/statistics-calculator/hypothesis-test</a><br /><br />The tutorial about dependent and independent samples<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://datatab.net/tutorial/dependant-and-independent-variables">https://datatab.net/tutorial/dependant-and-independent-variables</a>{% endraw %}
