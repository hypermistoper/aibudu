{% raw %}This film features national play experts Sue Palmer and Tim Gill; and chief executive of the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. Different aspects of play are set out: exploratory play vs. representational play; the role of play in the development of fine- and gross-motor skills; the links between play and speech and language; the difference between adult- and child-led play. Sue Palmer: &quot;Almost everything that we become as adults has its roots in play.&quot;{% endraw %}
