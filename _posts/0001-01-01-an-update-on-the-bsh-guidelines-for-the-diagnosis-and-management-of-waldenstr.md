{% raw %}Dima El-Sharkawi, MBBS, MA, PhD, MRCP, FRCPath, The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, Sutton, UK, gives an overview of the updates that have been made in the BSH guidelines on the diagnosis and management of Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (WM). In terms of diagnosis and investigations of patients with WM, the updated guidelines have incorporated the use of genomics as a tool to understand and differentiate WM from other indolent B-cell lymphomas. Dr El-Sharkawi also underlines some changes that have been made to make the guidelines more practical for clinicians. Moreover, the updated guidelines now contain in detail trial data for all available treatments for WM in the UK and in other countries, including Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTKi) inhibitors, as well as a multi-disciplinary approach to managing some of the complications in WM. This interview took place at the 62nd Annual Scientific Meeting of the British Society for Haematology (BSH) 2022, in Manchester, UK.{% endraw %}
