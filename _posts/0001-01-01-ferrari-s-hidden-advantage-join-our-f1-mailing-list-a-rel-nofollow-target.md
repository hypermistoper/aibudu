Theyâ€™re quick on the straights, and through the slow corners and, over a lap, nobody can touch them.<br /><br />They seem to have solved the Porpoising issues, been able to adapt their car for the three (very different) circuits weâ€™ve had so far, and been quick on every tyre theyâ€™ve run. <br /><br />But on top of that, they have been leveraging a couple of key advantages (and doing it very well).<br /><br />Let's get into it. <br /><br />ðŸ”§ Thanks to Scarbs for joining us once again!

A very defined concept that they have been running ever since, they have made very few changes to it. And those little changes have all been for track-specific reasons. <br /><br />Whereas if you look at Mercedes, Red Bull (or any of the other teams for that matter), they have been making component upgrades, vast setup changes and different concepts on each of their cars. <br /><br />If you look back at Lewis and Georgeâ€™s cars in Jeddah, the cars were set up very differently. (And Lewis made sure we knew it)<br /><br />Whereas Ferrari have stuck to its original plan, and it paid off. They have been learning their car inside out, gaining valuable experience with it - without the disruption of big setup or performance changes. <br /><br />By the way, if you havenâ€™t signed up to the newsletter yet, sign up in the description - weâ€™re bringing the most interesting F1 news to your inbox each week.<br /><br />âž¤ Join our Driver61 Community Discord! - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/driver61">https://discord.gg/driver61</a><br /><br />âž¤ Subscribe for more incredible motorsport: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/AbD2f9">https://goo.gl/AbD2f9</a><br /><br />âž¤Follow us on:<br />   âž¤ Instagram- @official_driver61 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/D61Insta">https://bit.ly/D61Insta</a><br />   âž¤TikTok - @official_driver61 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/D61TikTok">https://bit.ly/D61TikTok</a><br /><br />âž¤ Follow Callum on:<br /> âž¤ TikTok - @callumraces <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tiktok.com/@callumraces">https://tiktok.com/@callumraces</a><br /> âž¤ Twitter - @callum_mcintyre <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/@callum_mcintyre">https://twitter.com/@callum_mcintyre</a><br /> âž¤ Instagram - @mcintyre.jpg <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mcintyre.jpg/">https://www.instagram.com/mcintyre.jpg/</a><br /><br />#Driver61 #Formula1 #Ferrari{% endraw %}
