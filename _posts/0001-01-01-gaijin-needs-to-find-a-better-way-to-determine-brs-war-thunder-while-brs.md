{% raw %}While BRs have been decently accurate for a while, there are HUGE gaps in capability that spring up at several different parts of the tech tree - namely around 7.0 and 9.0BR for tanks, and similarly for planes, though I would argue that the first jets aren't necessarily a ton better than the last piston planes, unless flown correctly. For planes, I would almost say that the capability jump occurs with Korean War jets (7.7BR) and again with Vietnam Era/70's jets (10.0ish BR), as engines provide SUBSTANTIALLY more thrust around these BRs, as well as the fact that weapons systems are much improved.<br /><br />Either way, let me know in the comments below what sort of vehicles you think have wildly inaccurate BRs.<br /><br />F-86F-40 JASFD Review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ZWZe6C2uQe4">https://youtu.be/ZWZe6C2uQe4</a><br /><br />A2D-1 Crazy BR: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/eyNiprkToX0">https://youtu.be/eyNiprkToX0</a><br /><br />Yak-38 Review: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/KcJRJf371Qg">https://youtu.be/KcJRJf371Qg</a><br /><br />If you would like to support my channel, please consider subscribing.
