The house was designed in 1963 by John Lautner, a student of Frank Lloyd Wright. Goldstein purchased the property in the 1970s from previous owners who did not keep the house in good condition. Goldstein commissioned Lautner to make changes and improvements to the house. Below the main residence is an installation by light artist James Turrell known as &quot;Skyspace&quot; or &quot;Sky Box&quot;.<br />Goldstein worked closely with Lautner and Duncan Nicholson, who took over after Lautner's death in 1994.[10] Nicholson is now the chief architect. &quot;I wanted to remake the house exactly as John [Lautner] would have wanted it, and to introduce technology that didn't exist 30 years ago&quot;, Goldstein explained. The property next door to his also had a Lautner-designed house on it, which Goldstein bought and tore down to build a party house, tennis court and office. He continues to make improvements.[12] In 2016, Goldstein promised that the house eventually will become the property of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. The residence has also been featured in a number of movies, including Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, French Exit, and The Big Lebowski.&quot; <br /><br />Outfit by: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.faruksarac.com/">https://www.faruksarac.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/faruksaracofficial/">https://www.instagram.com/faruksaracofficial/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/orhunfaruksarac/">https://www.instagram.com/orhunfaruksarac/</a><br /><br />All historical footage and photography purchased through:<br />Getty Images - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/">https://www.gettyimages.com/</a><br />Shutterstock - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com/">https://www.shutterstock.com/</a><br />Artgrid - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://artgrid.io/">https://artgrid.io/</a><br />Storyblocks - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.storyblocks.com/">https://www.storyblocks.com/</a><br />© J.
