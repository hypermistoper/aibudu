{% raw %}Not a few people believe that the presence of women in financial matters can potentially increase welfare. The reason is, in principle, women have the same opportunities as men in improving the economy through investment. However, to achieve that understanding, women need encouragement and support, as well as access in financial matters, to education about gender equality. At least, that's what the Director of Business Incubation of The Greater Hub ITB, Dina Dellyana, said. <br /> <br />&quot;How do women start investing? Honestly, you have to go directly. Then, join the right community to accelerate our enthusiasm to continue learning. We actually need a trigger, if we are into we will continue to learn,&quot; said Dina, in a Tokocrypto event themed &quot;Women &amp; Financial Wellness.&quot; &quot;So, what about the world of investing in crypto assets? Do women and men have equal access? <br /> <br />1. Must join the community and stay DYOR <br /> <br />Dina said, to start investing in the world of crypto assets, women must be careful and not hesitate to join various communities. However, he said, the presence of the community can make potential investors not out of date. “Moreover, investing in crypto assets is vulnerable to issues, just join the community and stay DYOR (Do Your Own Research). You can practice with the right friends who have joined first, and start with a small nominal,&quot; said Dina. <br /> <br />Dina is one of the three main speakers in the “Women &amp; Financial Wellness” discussion. Besides Dina, the discussion also presented the Professor of FEB Unpad, Prof. Dian Masyita; and an author, scriptwriter and women's empowerment Advocate, Jenny Yusuf. The three panelists discussed the role of women in breaking down negative stigma and striving to have a positive impact on society to create financial freedom by investing. <br /> <br />2. Women must be technology literate, so they don't get caught up in fake investments <br /> <br />For Dian Masyita, women can actually have such a big impact on the crypto asset investment industry. Therefore, according to Dian, women must continue to strengthen their motivation to participate in understanding crypto asset instruments. In this digital era, said Dian, women must not only be technology literate, but also receive education related to digital-based financial management. It is important for women not to fall into fraudulent investments.{% endraw %}
