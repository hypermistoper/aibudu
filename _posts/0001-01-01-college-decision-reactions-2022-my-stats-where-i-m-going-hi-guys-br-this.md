{% raw %}hi guys :)<br />this video is honestly very hard for me to post HAHA. I didn't apply to that many schools, there's no ivies, and I got some shocking results..but nonetheless I am currently posting this video at 3 am with hopes that someone out there is encouraged and knows that they are not alone in this process. Please Please Please from the bottom of my heart know that your hard work is not defined by your results (but if you got in YOU DESERVE IT). I am so very proud of each and every person that fought through because MAN this was tough.<br />I also forgot to mention but I didn't apply to any schools too far/out of California because my mom wanted me to stay close by HAHA <br />i hope you guys enjoyed<br />- with love, deb<br /><br />insta: d3bkim{% endraw %}
