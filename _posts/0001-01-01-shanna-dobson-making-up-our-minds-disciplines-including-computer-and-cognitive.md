{% raw %}Disciplines including computer and cognitive science, developmental and evolutionary biology, and fundamental physics have advanced empirically-supported formal models in which perceived objects are “made up” in the sense of being observer- relative inferential constructs. In these models, the cognitive ontology an agent employs to organize its behavior is conditionally independent of the “real” ontology, if any, of its environment. Here we claim that these same models apply, without modification, to any agent’s metacognition about itself. “Minds” and in particular thoughts, beliefs, desires, and memories are just as “made up” as the external world and its objects, and are made up using the same mechanisms and for the same reasons. We describe this process in the physical language of holographic encoding on a boundary, and then focus on the case of time perception, episodic memory, and planning using the mathematical language of sheaf theory and condensed objects. We summarize a formal framework in which both retrospective and prospective memory are pure constructs from the present, reconstructed on demand moment to moment. Our approach makes a specific empirical prediction: that the neural mechanisms that generate retrospective and prospective memories implement a particular functor acting on sheaves of categorizations of observed events.{% endraw %}
