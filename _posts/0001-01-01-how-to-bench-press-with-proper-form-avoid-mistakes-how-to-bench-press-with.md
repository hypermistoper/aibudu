It trains all of the “pushing” muscles in a way that allows for heavy loads and develops the chest, shoulders, and triceps extremely effectively.  It would be very difficult to find a bodybuilder who didn’t develop their chest muscles without the use of the bench press.  It's also one of the “big 3” movements that powerlifters compete in along with the squat and the deadlift.  One of the most common questions that people ask others to gauge their strength is “how much can you bench.”  <br /><br />That all being said the bench press is also responsible for many shoulder, pec and elbow injuries.  In fact, a damaged AC joint in the shoulder is sometimes referred to as “bench press shoulder.”  If done properly the bench press can develop impressive muscle and strength. Below we list how to set up and execute a proper bench press for maximum power, strength, chest development and in a way that minimizes the risk of injury.  <br /><br />Step One:  Lay down on a flat bench.  Your feet should be on the floor and NOT up in the air or on the bench.  Keep the knees bent at 90 degrees with your feet directly under your knees.  Your upper back, shoulder blades, and butt should be in contact with the bench and should remain in contact with the bench.  Your low back should have a natural arch and should not be in contact with the bench.<br /><br />Step Two:  Grab the bar with a relatively wide distance.  Your grip should be wider than your shoulders. Typically, your ring finger or pinky finger will be placed on the rings that are present on all bench press bars.<br /><br />Step Three:  Squeeze your shoulder blades back and down.  In other words, pinch your shoulder blades together while simultaneously bring them down your back…basically don’t let them shrug.<br /><br />Step Four: Grip the bar hard and unrack the weight.  Brace your entire body. Slowly lower the weight to below your nipple line.  Your elbows shouldn’t be out at 90 degrees (that a great way to hurt your shoulder).  Elbows should be at about 75 degrees.  Touch your chest with the bar and press it all the way back up. It should take you about 3 seconds to lower the bar and about 1-3 seconds to raise the bar.  <br /><br />That’s it!  You are bench pressing!  You are on your way to developing a muscular chest, shoulders, and triceps!  <br /><br />For more chest workouts and videos on how to do the bench press and the best bench press for your upper chest, make sure to subscribe to Mind Pump TV for all of our awesome fitness information: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/mindpumptv">https://www.youtube.com/mindpumptv</a><br /><br />Connect with Mind Pump: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mindpumpmedia.com/">https://www.mindpumpmedia.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mindpumpmedia/">https://www.instagram.com/mindpumpmedia/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/mindpump">https://www.facebook.com/mindpump</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/mindpumptv">https://www.youtube.com/mindpumptv</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/mindpump">https://twitter.com/mindpump</a>{% endraw %}
