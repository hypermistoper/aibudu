{% raw %}ﾟ+..｡*ﾟ+ Thank you for watching +..｡*ﾟ+<br />Tw: mentions of eating disorder, overdose, suicidal thoughts, gore/blood, and fatshaming<br /><br />I went out of my comfort zone with this video but I hope you guys enjoy! I tried my best to finish this video before the end of february. I really regret not making a valentines video since I make one every year. But I also wanted to steer away from love stuff since it was starting to get repetitive. Again, I don’t mean to body shame anyone with this video so please don’t feel insecure of your body!!
