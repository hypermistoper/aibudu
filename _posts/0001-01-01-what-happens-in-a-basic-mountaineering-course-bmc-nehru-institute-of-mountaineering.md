{% raw %}If you love adventure then check out this video about my experience during a Basic Mountaineering Course. I spent 28 adventure packed days in the mountains training rigorously. This course had been on my bucket list for a very long time until I finally got a chance to do it in June 2019 from Nehru Institute of Mountaineering (NIM). During this course I climbed, I fell down, I gave up, I got back up, I laughed, I cried. All in all, this BMC has been one crazy rollercoaster ride. It has given me some amazing friends and memories to cherish for a lifetime. Watch this video to experience it all through my eyes.  <br /><br />How to prepare for a Basic Mountaineering Course? <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD4pcKovzno">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD4pcKovzno</a><br /><br />Follow me:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/whereishemanshi">https://www.instagram.com/whereishemanshi</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/whereishemanshi">https://www.facebook.com/whereishemanshi</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/whereishemanshi">https://twitter.com/whereishemanshi</a><br /><br />Music from YouTube Audio Library<br />Indigo- Eveningland<br /><br />Love Now- Eveningland<br /><br />Casey donâ€™t you fret- Dan Lebowitz<br /><br />Last train to mars- Dan Lebowitz<br /><br />Firefly- Chris Haugen<br /><br />Fresh Fallen Snow- Chris Haugen<br /><br />Waterfall- Aakash Gandhi<br /><br />Back Home- Coyote Hearing<br /><br />Memory Rain- Yung Logos<br /><br />Midnight- Dan Henig<br /><br /><br /><br />Co-editing and Sound- Ritendra Dirghangi<br /><br />Additional Video Footage- Snehi Singh{% endraw %}
