In less than a year, she's gained over 500,000 followers on TikTok, due to her down to earth story telling of hauntings, spooky legends and murders. But there’s one specific story that has captivated her followers - the infamous Lizzie Borden case. Dating back over 130 years, a young woman in Fall River, Massachusetts was accused of the brutal murders of her father and step-mother. No-one was ever convicted of the murders, although rumours of Lizzie’s guilt followed her for the rest of her life. Fascinated by the case, Amanda set out to prove Lizzie’s innocence once and for all, even getting help from some spirits along the way. Amanda’s research, and previous investigations have lead her to believe that the real murderer of Lizzie’s father and stepmother was the uncle. As Amanda makes her fifth visit to the Lizzie Borden House, she will attempt to make contact with Lizzie for the very first time and find some closure on this mystery. <br /><br />For more from Amanda follow:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/spookynewenglandghoul/">https://www.instagram.com/spookynewenglandghoul/</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@spookynewengland">https://www.tiktok.com/@spookynewengland</a> <br /><br />To find out more about staying at The Lizzie Borden House, you can find details here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://usghostadventures.com/">https://usghostadventures.com/</a><br /><br />Producers: Joel Ross, Ruby Coote<br />Editor: Garry Sykes<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
