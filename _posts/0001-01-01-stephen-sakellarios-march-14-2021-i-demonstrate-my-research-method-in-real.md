{% raw %}I demonstrate my research method in real time, with evidence I had not yet examined from the 1838-1839 Portland &quot;Transcript.&quot;<br /><br /><br />FYI, I subsequently discovered a lengthy &quot;F.&quot;-signed poem entitled &quot;Extracts From a Poem on Ambition,&quot; which is written precisely in MFW's style and with his anti-war sensibilities. I didn't initially identify it as his because it isn't signed until the third installment. It is serialized in the editions of March 2nd, 9th and 16th, 1839.{% endraw %}
