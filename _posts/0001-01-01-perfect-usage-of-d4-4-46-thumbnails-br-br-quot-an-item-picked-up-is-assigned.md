{% raw %}4:46 Thumbnails<br /><br />&quot;An item picked up is assigned the pool of the most recently generated item; usually this has correct results but a difference can be seen, for instance, by killing a boss, entering a Devil Deal that has items and collecting the boss reward after seeing the Devil items. The boss item will be rerolled to a Devil pool item with D4. Items with no item pool (starting items, fixed drops etc.) will always use the item pool of the most recently generated item from an item pool as a result; if no items from item pools were encountered yet, the treasure room pool is used.&quot; - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/D4?so=search#Bugs">https://bindingofisaacrebirth.fandom.com/wiki/D4?so=search#Bugs</a><br /><br />My Discord Server :: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/nyantuber">https://discord.gg/nyantuber</a><br /><br />The Binding of Isaac: Repentance<br />BGM :: Antibirth Music++ mod / Antibirth Soundtrack<br />MODS :: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2704628219">https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2704628219</a>{% endraw %}
