{% raw %}EuroSort has developed the Cross Tray Sorter - an industry disruptive technology aimed at addressing the shortcomings of other high-speed unit sorters for non-conveyable, fragile, and lightweight items. Using a positive mechanical divert that can sort both left and right and a simple and reliable divert mechanism that avoids expensive motors in the carriers, the Cross Tray Sorter can sort previously unsortable items at throughputs of up to 9,600 items/hour.<br /><br />To learn more about Eurosort's Cross Tray Sorters, visit <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eurosort.com/sorters/cross-tray-sorter/.">https://www.eurosort.com/sorters/cross-tray-sorter/.</a>{% endraw %}
