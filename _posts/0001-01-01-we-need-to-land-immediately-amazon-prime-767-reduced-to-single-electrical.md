An Amazon Prime Air Boeing 767-300ER(BCF) is operating an early-morning flight from Los Angeles to Seattle. As the aircraft climbs, the electrical generator connected to the right engine fails. The aircraft’s APU is inoperative, leaving the crew with a single source of electrical power – the left engine’s generator. They declare an emergency and turn around for an immediate landing in Los Angeles. Watch and listen as the pilots and air traffic control coordinate to get the aircraft back on the ground safely.<br /><br />Flight Number: 8C1917 / ATN1917<br />Route: Los Angeles International Airport (LAX / KLAX) ❯ Seattle–Tacoma International Airport (SEA / KSEA)<br />Registration: N431AZ<br />Type: Boeing 767-300ER(BCF)<br /><br />----------<br /><br />0:00 Air Transport 1917<br />0:25 Takeoff<br />2:01 Reporting the problem<br />4:29 Contact SOCAL Approach<br />6:25 Landing<br /><br />#Emergency #Mayday #AirTrafficVisualised<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Air traffic control audio courtesy of LiveATC.net.<br /><br />----------<br /><br />Photos of N431AZ by Haocheng Fang (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.jetphotos.com/photo/10310746);">https://www.jetphotos.com/photo/10310746);</a> @texas_aviation20 (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/texas_aviation20/)">https://www.instagram.com/texas_aviation20/)</a> used with permission.<br /><br />Content Attribution – The following are licensed under CC BY:<br />&quot;Iconic LAX Theme Park Restaurant&quot; by prayitnophotography.{% endraw %}
