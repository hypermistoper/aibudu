{% raw %}Everyone knows the deal where car rental companies charge you outrageous fees to re fill the car if you bring it back  so much as one pint under full. Well Dollar Rent A Car has a  new hidden fee  on top of the standard ones  regarding filling the tank. They charge you a  &quot;fuel charge &quot; if you bring the car back FULL but don't have a receipt. Yes, you heard right they hit you with  a refueling charge even if you brought it back full. The charge is hidden they never tell you the amount of the &quot;fuel charge&quot; till you check out. So if you forgot a gas  receipt  get ready to get  to get hit with a made up charge when you check in. Sounds outrageous so we   went in undercover to find out.<br /><br />That is not all,subesquently and unrelated  now consumers allege they are being charged for insurance even after they decline it. If this has happened to you go to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.investigativeguy.com/dollar-rent-a-car-overcharge-contact-request-form/">http://www.investigativeguy.com/dollar-rent-a-car-overcharge-contact-request-form/</a> for more information.{% endraw %}
