{% raw %}#potager #sweetpeas #carrotcake #garden #cottagegarden<br />It's exciting to see some of the Sweet peas that have been nurtured from seed to seedling to plant, going into their permanent locations in in Pots.<br /> We use every spare bit of real estate in our Potager, to fit in as many varieties of plants as possible.<br /> I'll bake a wonderful Carrot Cake at the end of the video.<br /> On Wednesday we'll do a short video, Morning Coffee Garden walk.{% endraw %}
