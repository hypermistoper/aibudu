{% raw %}Deep Brain Stimulation, also called DBS, is a well proven treatment option that helps relieve the tremors, slowness and stiffness associated with Parkinson’s Disease when the medications are not maintaining a good quality of life .<br /><br /><br />This surgical procedure involves placing tiny electrodes in precise areas of the brain, and using a neurostimulator to send electrical impulses to stimulate those areas. Not only does this procedure offer relief from symptoms, but it also allows patients to reduce their reliance on medication. <br /><br />Find out more about this revolutionary technique from Professor Peter Silburn AM, Neurologist and world expert on treating Parkinson’s Disease. He provides insight into the procedure, the benefits of DBS, and who makes a good candidate for DBS.{% endraw %}
