{% raw %}Hello, friends! We know you love watching school hacks, so we prepared a fresh collection of them :) Have you ever thought about turning your notebook’s cover into a chalkboard? I know, it sounds crazy! But you can actually make it if you paint your notebook with chalkboard paint. Now you can write anything and easily remove it with a wet wipe :) <br /><br />We will show you a smart way to draw a circle without a compass (you will need just a marker and a piece of paper). There is another way to do it, see the tutorial in the video! If your child loves drawing, make them a reusable coloring book using a photo frame. Next, we will show you how to make DIY stickers to decorate your notebooks. If you want to freshen up your backpack, keep watching this video to see how we did it :)<br /><br /><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br /><br />00:01 — How to make a reusable notebook cover<br /><br />00:59 — How to draw a perfect circle<br /><br />02:37 — DIY reusable coloring book<br /><br />03:55 — DIY stickers<br /><br />07:45 — How to decorate your backpack<br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
