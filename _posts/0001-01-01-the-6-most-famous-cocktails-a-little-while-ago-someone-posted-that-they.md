{% raw %}A little while ago someone posted that they wanted a video on Root cocktails and I thought that was a fantastic idea, so here one is. This video teaches my preferred versions of the six cocktails whose creation inspired the entire universe of cocktails we have today. Every serious bartender who has been studying cocktails for a while are familiar with the idea that there are Root cocktails, or cocktails which are not only a specific drink but gave birth to a category by lending their template to countless other drinks. I will often see someone in the comments saying something like this: &quot;Oh this drinks is just a so and so cocktail with the sugar and spirit changed out.&quot; While this statement is totally true, it's also true that every cocktail in existence came out of one of the six in this video. The bartenders behind Death &amp; Co. and Proprietor's LLC have recently Published a book called Cocktail Codex all about Root cocktails and everyone should give it a gander, it is a great book!
