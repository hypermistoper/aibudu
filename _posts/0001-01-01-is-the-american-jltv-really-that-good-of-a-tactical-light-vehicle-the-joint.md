{% raw %}The Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV) is a United States military (specifically U.S. Army, U.S. Marine Corps) and United States Special Operations Command program to part-replace the Humvee with a family of more survivable vehicles with greater payload. Early studies for the JLTV program were approved in 2006. The JLTV program incorporates lessons learned from the earlier Future Tactical Truck Systems program and other associated efforts.<br /><br />The JLTV program has evolved considerably throughout various development phases and milestones including required numbers and pricing. Variants are capable of performing armament carrier, utility, command and control (shelter), ambulance, reconnaissance and a variety of other tactical and logistic support roles. JLTV follows the U.S. Army's Long Term Armor Strategy with kits for two levels of armor protection. Oshkosh's L-ATV was selected as the winner of the JLTV program in August 2015 and awarded an initial production contract for up to 16,901 JLTVs. The U.S. Army approved the JLTV for full–rate production in June 2019.<br /><br />A competitive rebuy for the A2 JLTV is currently in progress, the final Request for Proposal (RfP) for this issued on 9 February 2022, with a contract award expected in September 2022.<br /><br />Hope you enjoy!! <br /><br />#military #vehicles #marines <br /><br />💥 💣 Check out our partnership clothing brand!
