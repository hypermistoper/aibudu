{% raw %}Not everyday you come across a waterpark and a dirt bike track on the same property! Such a fun feeling ripping down the slides on dirt bikes and seeing how fast you can bank off of the turns! Shoutout to the homie Jacob for taking us flying around in his helicopter it's wild how many new dirt bike spots we found to ride. Padres are back in full swing so we will be hitting as many home games in San Diego as we can! Thank you to everyone who watches and supports us we truly appreciate you!
