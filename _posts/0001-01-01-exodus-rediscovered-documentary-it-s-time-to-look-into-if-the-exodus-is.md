{% raw %}It's time to look into if the Exodus is historical or not! We evaluate all the evidence for the exodus and ask if it is historical or not.<br /><br />This is a revised and updated version. The old one was removed last year. Sources are included throughout the video.<br /><br /><br />Don't forget to help us create more videos!
