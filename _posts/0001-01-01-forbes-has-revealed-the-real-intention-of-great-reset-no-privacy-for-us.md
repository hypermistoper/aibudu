{% raw %}I have just found this world economic forum article published by Forbes<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/worldeconomicforum/2016/11/10/shopping-i-cant-really-remember-what-that-is-or-how-differently-well-live-in-2030/">https://www.forbes.com/sites/worldeconomicforum/2016/11/10/shopping-i-cant-really-remember-what-that-is-or-how-differently-well-live-in-2030/</a><br />If you read it carefully everything will be clear to you about what is the real intention of the Great Reset leading by Klaus Schwab . Now i understand that  real intention is to transform system of buying for system of renting or services. It is written clear that in &quot; our city there is no privacy at all &quot;<br /><br />If you like our work and want to donate here is the link .
