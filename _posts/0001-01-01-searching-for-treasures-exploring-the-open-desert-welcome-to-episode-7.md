{% raw %}Welcome to episode #7 of Stay Fishy Adventures! Today we're heading out into the open desert in search of treasure. We're looking for precious rocks, deer or elk sheds, arrowheads, or anything else cool we can find. Hiking around looking for things in the great outdoors is so refreshing, relaxing, fun, and exciting all at once. I'm so happy to bring you along for the ride.
