{% raw %}Just take a moment and watch Eden Hazard, casually gliding past Benjamin Pavard and Paul Pogba in the World Cup 2018.<br /><br />That's what physicality is in football. Not just being massive and tall, but strength, power, agility, speed and balance coming all together.<br /><br />it's not about how big you are, it's about how well you can control your body.<br /><br />By the way, what a player he is.<br /><br />Sources: MBC{% endraw %}
