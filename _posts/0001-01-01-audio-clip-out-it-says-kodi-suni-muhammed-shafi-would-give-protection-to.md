A WhatsApp audio suspected to be that of the mastermind talking to the carrier in gold smuggling, is out. The audio says Kodi Suni and Muhammed Shafi would give protection to the smuggling team.<br />The audio clip reportedly explains how the smuggled gold that is stolen by quotation gangs needs to be apportioned. <br />The smuggled gold that is stolen from the carrier is divided into 3 portions and one portion is allotted to the `party’, says the audio message. The team of Kodi Suni, accused in the TP murder case who is presently lodged in the jail, and another accused Muhammed Shafi are mentioned as `party’ in the audio.
