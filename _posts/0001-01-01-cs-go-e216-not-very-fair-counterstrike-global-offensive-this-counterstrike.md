From 10000-14000 views on the first episodes released over one year ago. Sure it was a long time before CS GO become really popular. But it sure as fuck is now 60000-100000+ views on most videos released last month. So i think i can say damn im good at predicting good games. Why are you still reading this? Maybe you want to know the end of the story? The end is that CS GO will go free to play within 6 months and in 12 months time it will be the number one Esport bigger then both LOL and Dota 2. ImAnderZEL is not responsible for any CS GO prediction which turns out to be wrong! Thanks for reading now go press that damn Like button!{% endraw %}
