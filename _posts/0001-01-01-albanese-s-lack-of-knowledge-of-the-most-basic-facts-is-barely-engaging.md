{% raw %}Sky News host Cory Bernardi says Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese’s “lack of knowledge” of the most basic facts is “barely engaging”. <br /><br />Mr Albanese was recently unable to recall national unemployment statistics while campaigning in Tasmania earlier this week. <br /><br />Mr Bernardi said the “lack of innovative policy initiatives” is already making the federal election campaign “a bit ho-hum”.<br /><br />“I did think he made a bit of a blunder though when he chose to cite the Taylor Swift song ‘Shake it Off’ as a means of moving on. Rather than the title, he should have used the first couple of lines,” he said. <br /> <br />“’I stay out too late, got nothing in my brain’ might have been more appropriate.”{% endraw %}
