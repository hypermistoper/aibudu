{% raw %}Hey guys! Iâ€™m back with another loopy case review! <br />I recently bought the brand new Violet Quartz loopy case and Iâ€™ve had the purple sparkle ombrÃ© for a few months now. A lot of you have requested that I do a video on the purple sparkle ombre so I included that in this video! <br /><br />I have had my loopy case for about 7 months now so I am able to give a detailed review on how it has held up for me! <br /><br />You can find my previous loopy case review here: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/QPNiy8XBoIc">https://youtu.be/QPNiy8XBoIc</a><br /><br />I am not sponsored by loopy in any way. They didnâ€™t give me any free cases and I donâ€™t get any commission or anything when you purchase. I just simply really like the case and wanted to share it with you all! <br /><br />âœ¨Discount code: INTHELOOP <br />Your welcome to use this code to get 10% off of your order! ðŸ˜‰<br /><br />Thanks for watching my video and please consider subscribing to my channel before you go!{% endraw %}
