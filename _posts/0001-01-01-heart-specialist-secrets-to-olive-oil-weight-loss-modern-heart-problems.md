{% raw %}Dr. Soffer (Cardiologist) and I will discuss the many health benefits how extra virgin olive oil has shown to help reduce one's risk for heart disease.<br /><br />Clogged arteries result from the build-up of a substance called plaque in the arterial walls. It is also medically referred to as arterial plaque. This plaque can reduce blood flow or even block it altogether.<br />Clogged arteries increase your risk of developing other health complications like a heart attack or stroke.  <br />Some of the most common risk factors for clogged arteries are:<br />High levels of LDL (bad cholesterol) or low levels of HDL (good cholesterol)<br />A high blood pressure<br />Smoking tobacco<br />Diabetes or elevated blood sugar levels<br />A family history of atherosclerosis or clogged arteries<br />Stress<br />Obesity<br />A sedentary lifestyle<br /><br />Most cases of clogged arteries do not exhibit any symptoms until a heart attack or blood clot presents itself. However, in cases where 70% or more of the arteries are blocked, you will notice the following symptoms.<br />Severe cases of clogged arteries may exhibit symptoms like:<br />Shortness of breath<br />Sweating<br />Nausea<br />Chest pain or angina<br />Palpitations of the heart<br />Dizziness<br />Weakness<br /><br />THE MEDICAL INFORMATION ON THIS SITE IS PROVIDED AS AN INFORMATION RESOURCE ONLY, AND IS NOT TO BE USED OR RELIED ON FOR ANY DIAGNOSTIC OR TREATMENT PURPOSES.
