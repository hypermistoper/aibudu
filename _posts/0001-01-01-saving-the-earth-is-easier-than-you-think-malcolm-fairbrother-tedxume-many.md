{% raw %}Many people know that the world is in serious trouble because of pollution. What people don't know is that there are actually many success stories where environmental policies have worked really well. We could accomplish so much by building on that track record.  I am a professor of sociology at Umeå University and a researcher at the Institute for Futures Studies in Stockholm. My career has taken me around the world. I am originally from western Canada, and have also lived in the United States, Mexico, England, and now Sweden. My research is mostly about public attitudes towards environmental issues and policies, and in other projects I also study trust and globalization. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
