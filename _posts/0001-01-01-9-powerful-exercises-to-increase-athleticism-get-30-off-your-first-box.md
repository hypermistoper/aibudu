If you want to run faster, jump higher, balance better, increase endurance, boost explosiveness, and get stronger... these moves will help you get there.<br /><br />This is one of the main goals of functional training, but it applies outside of pro athletes and sports teams!<br /><br />I think this kind of training can benefit more people. I believe everyone should aim to increase athleticism; so that they can be more competitive in sports, be more capable doing manual work, and feel more energetic and pain-free. <br /><br />I've seen my own jump height, in particular, increase significantly since adding some of these. There are loads I've left off though. One of my favourites absent from this list is the goblet jump squat. But I've raved about that a LOT in previous videos...<br /><br />I'd love to know your top exercises that increase athleticism down below.<br /><br />Enjoy and thanks for watching!<br /><br />People seem to like it when I add chapters to these lists, so here you go:<br /><br />00:41 Banded Lateral Walk<br />01:14 Barbell Hip Thrust<br />03:45 ATG Split Squat<br />04:51 Bag Drag<br />06:20 Sandbag Snatch<br />07:18 Med Ball Slam<br />07:58 Med Ball Rotational Throw<br />08:37 Nordic Curl<br />09:16 Single Leg Leg RDL{% endraw %}
