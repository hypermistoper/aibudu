This week Objectively Dan is joined once again by the USA‚Äôs favourite deity, Jesus H Christ!<br /><br />Barrie the Kiwi is first up, he‚Äôs got an alien abduction/medical emergency metaphor for us.  JC suggests that traumatic experiences could lead to false memories, and Dan probes Barrie for details.  Verbally, of course.  JC admits to an odd fetish, you‚Äôll have to listen to find out, no spoilers!  Barrie‚Äôs also got a UFO story, but sadly, is interrupted before he can finish (probably by aliens).<br /><br />Steve is next, who has a new philosophical argument for‚Ä¶ rabbits?  I‚Äôm as confused as Dan.  It takes a lot to bewilder a deity, but Jesus Christ!  Is.  We‚Äôre gonna move along, thanks for the call Steve!<br /><br />Marcus is a new atheist who‚Äôs received a letter from his mother, claiming that she‚Äôs had a revelation from God.  Jesus has no record of this intervention, and tells us that heaven has a ‚Äúno indirect revelation‚Äù policy.  Good to know, Lord.  Marcus thinks there‚Äôs a chance this could be for real, and Dan has a tarot card analogy that seems more likely than miracles.  Many of us have been there too, remember that we humans are pattern seekers, and coincidences are just that, and nothing more.<br /><br />Our final two callers have crawled out from beneath a bridge, taken a break from extorting billy goats, and graced us with their nonsense.  Strap in!<br /><br />Douglas in Canada thinks that the McCarthy era addition of In God We Trust to American currency is proof of God.  Douglas is also unaware that this is a recent addition.  He throws some childish insults at Jesus, which is entirely un-Christian, and our hosts play with their food for a brief moment before Douglas runs away.  This man does not represent Canada.<br /><br />Alex in Cali is off the road, and off the rails.  We begin with the accusation that our guest is not the REAL Jesus‚Ä¶ pretty sure we all knew that.  Alex coins the term ‚Äúself-exist,‚Äù presents a few ridiculous false dichotomies, is thoroughly owned by our hosts, and runs back beneath his bridge.  Stick to goats dude.<br /><br />Well that was fun!  Tune in next week, when two lowly mortals will continue their side-quest for the truth!  The main quest is donuts.  <br /><br />WHAT IS TRUTH WANTED?<br /><br />Truth Wanted is a show about getting to the bottom of beliefs, whether it‚Äôs karma or Christ, Bigfoot or crystals. Truth Wanted would like to know how you know it‚Äôs true. Primarily hosted by ObjectivelyDan, Truth Wanted takes calls from the community (that means YOU!) and features new guests every week, emphasizing thorough conversations over name-calling and scoffing (most of the time). Truth Wanted focuses on how and why people believe what they believe, and how you can talk about beliefs in more effective ways. Join us for truth investigations and lively conversations every Friday at 7:00pm CT! <br /><br />Call the show!  6:30-8 PM CT at 1-512-991-9242<br />or call with your computer üíª <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://tiny.cc/calltw">http://tiny.cc/calltw</a><br /><br />‚ñ∫ Don't like ads?
