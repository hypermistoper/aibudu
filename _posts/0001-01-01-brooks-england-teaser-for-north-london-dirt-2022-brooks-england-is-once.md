{% raw %}Brooks England is once again official partners for London’s coolest gravel event: North London Dirt 2022. Following a 115km (70 mile) all-surface course, NLD offers riders a self-supported gravel adventure unlike any other, covering everything from quiet lanes and dirt paths to tight wooded singletrack. Beyond providing participants with a single-day urban, suburban, and rural escape from the city, the event also brings a diverse gravel community together to raise money for the St. Mary's Centre—a London community hub that hosts, among other things, a migrant centre, food bank and homeless shelter. The event starts with a warm cup of Workshop Coffee and ends with a cold pint from Magic Rock Brewing.<br /><br />Join us as we take to Gravel for Good! <br /><br />@northlondondirt (IG)<br />#NorthLondonDirt #escapethecity #BrooksEngland #ForBoundlessJourneys <br /><br />Direction Harry Reavley (@harryreavley)<br />In collaboration with Workshop Coffee (@workshopcoffee)<br />DOP: @chrismarleytm<br />B Cam: @cal_travis<br />Editor: @edenraeread<br />Sound Designer: @chokiebikie<br />Sound Recordist: @chrisdsutton23{% endraw %}
