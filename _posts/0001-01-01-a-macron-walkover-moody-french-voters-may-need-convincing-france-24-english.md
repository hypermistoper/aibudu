{% raw %}President Emmanuel Macron is in no way guaranteed to sweep France's presidential run-off against far-right rival Marine Le Pen. Polls show the run-off will be far from the walkover he enjoyed in the same match-up 2017, when Macron won 66 percent to Le Pen's 34 percent. This time, a series of polls have suggested Macron would win 51 to 54 percent against 46 to 49 percent for Le Pen, with margins of error making a Le Pen victory possible.<br />#France #Macron #LePen<br /><br />üîî Subscribe to France 24 now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://f24.my/YTen">https://f24.my/YTen</a><br />üî¥ LIVE - Watch FRANCE 24 English 24/7 here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://f24.my/YTliveEN">https://f24.my/YTliveEN</a><br /><br />üåç Read the latest International News and Top Stories: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.france24.com/en/">https://www.france24.com/en/</a><br /><br />Like us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://f24.my/FBen">https://f24.my/FBen</a><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://f24.my/TWen">https://f24.my/TWen</a><br />Discover the news in pictures on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://f24.my/IGen">https://f24.my/IGen</a>{% endraw %}
