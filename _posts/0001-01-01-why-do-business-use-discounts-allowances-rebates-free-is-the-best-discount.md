{% raw %}Free is the best discount, though better is the value gained from acquiring/consuming the product. Offering discounts on purchases is a good way to quickly bring people into our store (online &amp; physical store).<br /><br />There are many purposes for discounting, including to increase short-term sales, to move out-of-date stock, to reward valuable customers, to encourage distribution channel members to perform a function, or to otherwise reward behaviors that benefit the discount issuer. Along with discounts, there are also other tools at our disposal to entice customers. In reality we will use a number of them for different campaigns to both pull our customers in &amp; push our products through the supply chain to the end user. <br /><br />I hope the video takes you beyond the definition &amp; helps to make the learning process a little more tangible. <br /><br />Note: Videos have been made with international students in mind, as such if your finding the speed of speech slow, please increase playback speed to 1.25 in youtube.<br /><br />––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––<br />Video Content <br /><br />0:00 - Introduction to Discounts, Allowances &amp; Rebates <br />0:33 - Quantity Discounts <br />1:23 - Cash Discounts<br />2:09 - Functional Discounts <br />2:35 - Seasonal Discounts <br />3:05 - Stocktake Sales <br />3:38 - Promotional Allowances &amp; Rebates <br /><br />––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––<br />Came across a great saying:<br />“Pricing is the only element in the marketing mix that produces revenue; the other elements produce costs. – Phillip Kotler<br />––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––<br />School of Learning <br />Arnav Dutta <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnav-dutta-a2020a44">https://www.linkedin.com/in/arnav-dutta-a2020a44</a>{% endraw %}
