{% raw %}Daily life often feels pretty dull - coffee, commute, work, dinner, bed - then the weekend... Aaaand REPEAT. <br /><br />I think since starting a job, it's hit me pretty hard that my current routine is basically the next 30 years of my life, potentially. And I've HAD to stop seeing fulfilment as a destination I'll reach once I've accomplished professional goals, and instead to start finding FULFILMENT IN EVERYDAY LIFE üôå<br /><br />So, I've been looking for ways to find fulfilment in the small things - that has meant building up powerful habits to change my mindset in a few key areas. And those habits are meaning I feel more happy and fulfilled with everyday life üòÄ<br /><br />‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.<br /><br />Menos - Minimalist, sustainable design (by Liam &amp; Beth)<br /><br />Sign up to get pre-launch access to one of only 200 grey and 400 black Menos backpack, made from recycled plastic - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://wearemenos.com">https://wearemenos.com</a> ‚ú® <br /><br />Beth and I have created Menos to bring minimalist, sustainable design to help us all boss the everyday.

I graduated from Cambridge University (where I studied French and Spanish), topped my law school class and now work for a corporate law firm in London as a trainee solicitor (which takes up a lot of my time)!<br /><br />Around that, I'm a big fan of discovering new ways of thinking, of balancing work with life, and of performing to the very best of my ability. Ohh, and being happy. And I try to share all that on this YouTube channel üòÄ<br /><br />Fun fact: I believe we massively overplay the role of ‚Äúnatural talent‚Äù üòÆ AND‚Ä¶ I also believe that TOGETHER, WE ARE ALL CAPABLE OF POSITIVITY, PRODUCTIVITY AND SUCCESS.<br /><br />üì∏  Instagram ‚Äì <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/liam.porritt/">https://www.instagram.com/liam.porritt/</a><br />üåç  My little kingdom ‚Äì <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://liamporritt.com">https://liamporritt.com</a>{% endraw %}
