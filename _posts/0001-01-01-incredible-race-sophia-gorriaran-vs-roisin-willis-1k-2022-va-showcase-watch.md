It wasn't a personal best for Willis, who ran 2:41.53 in 2021, but it now gives her the No. 2 and No. 5 performances on the all-time charts. Gorriaran's effort, meanwhile, was her first truly fast 1K and it is now No. 6 all-time and was the second-fastest junior performance in history. <br /><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://flosports.link/3p20lTj">http://flosports.link/3p20lTj</a><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://flosports.link/3p4YLQp">http://flosports.link/3p4YLQp</a><br /><br />Get the FloSports iOS app: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/FloTrackiOSApp_9">http://bit.ly/FloTrackiOSApp_9</a><br /><br />Follow FloTrack<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/FloTrack">https://www.facebook.com/FloTrack</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/flotrack">https://twitter.com/flotrack</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/FloTrack">https://www.instagram.com/FloTrack</a>{% endraw %}
