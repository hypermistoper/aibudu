{% raw %}Track title: 點妝謠 A Touch of Adornment<br />Language: Mandarin Chinese<br />Arranged and composed by: 阿原<br />Vocals: 傲嬌麒兒<br />Lyrics: L桑<br />MV: Muu<br /><br />You can visit our facebook page at:<br />www.facebook.com/BeautiChineseMusic/<br /><br />I have written up a rough translation of the song upon request by a friend! It was really difficult to put literary Chinese into English, but I did it.<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />(0:01 - 0:58) Her snow white face, a little rouge she spreads. Her crimson lips, reveal a slight dimple. So many words, cold dews become the waves of spring like the flow of time. Her charming smile could enchant cities and kingdoms. <br /><br />(0:59 - 1:35) The greatest brush that paint flowers to life, the exclusive ink found only in treasures, could not paint her silhouette so. Passing of age, as youth slips away, countless brilliant men anguished with regret. The face changes, like the whither and fall of peach blossoms, the breeze of spring is lonely again. The zither strings remain silent, and lets the lute lament. (In Chinese characters the words for 'zither string' is also a way to describe a &quot;young lady/girl', the lyricists made a double meaning in this phrase, as it could also mean the girl pouring her heart out with the sounds from her lute!) <br /><br />(1:52 - 2:27) Autumn winds has come, through the windows the trees seem to dance. Silk curtains around, sitting in front of the zither, sincerely. Flowers blossom to the delicate hands that play the ancient song, they sway and dance in this entrancing display. <br /><br />(2:28 - 3:02) Such beauty! But why do the brows, frown like so? Willow catkins drift, where the wind and rains take them. A young girl in troubled times, fallen home and country, now fire beacons are everywhere. She hates her delicate frame, for she can't be the woman she wants. <br /><br />(3:03 - end) Such beauty! But why do the brows, frown like so? Willow catkins drift, where the wind and rains take them. A young girl in troubled times, home and country in ruins, some say the fault lies in the girl. Beauty brings calamity, it is heaven's will and envy for her to be ill of fate.<br /><br /><br />#chinesemusic{% endraw %}
