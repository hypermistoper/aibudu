It’s not so much WHAT you build with, but how WELL you put it all together. Take building sealing for airtightness. Why pay to heat or cool your home and then just let the air leak out? There's a lot of problems with that: <br />● if it leaks air it might leak water. <br />● if it leaks air it might leak bugs. <br />● if it leaks air it impacts energy efficiency<br />There's no good argument for air leakage through the building envelope - the floors, walls and ceilings. Random leakage is NOT the same as ventilation. Once you seal a building up well you can add some effective ventilation and it will finally work right. <br />This video covers the basics of airtightness! Build Tight and Ventilate Right! <br />There are heaps of other resources available online, so check out see the links below:<br />#buildingairtightness #buildingperformance #energyeffciency<br /><br />ATTMA Air Tightness Testers around Australia:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bcta.group/attma/members/air-tightness-testers/australia/">https://www.bcta.group/attma/members/air-tightness-testers/australia/</a> <br /><br />More information and videos about air sealing and ventilation at the AIVAA website:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://aivaa.asn.au/basics-of-sealing/">http://aivaa.asn.au/basics-of-sealing/</a> <br /><br />Minimising Condensation in Buildings videos from the ABCB: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abcb.gov.au/Resources/Videos/Minimising-Condensation-in-Buildings">https://www.abcb.gov.au/Resources/Videos/Minimising-Condensation-in-Buildings</a><br /><br />Master Builders Victoria Maintaining the Thermal Building Envelope videos:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://app.qin.world/mbavneebp/pages/76">https://app.qin.world/mbavneebp/pages/76</a> <br /><br />Your Home: Australia's Guide to Environmentally Sustainable Homes:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.yourhome.gov.au/">https://www.yourhome.gov.au/</a> <br /><br />The National Energy Efficient Buildings Project's Cross-Industry Skills Training Project:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://energymining.sa.gov.au/energy_and_technical_regulation/energy_efficiency/national_energy_efficiency_building_project/cross-industry_skills_training_project">http://energymining.sa.gov.au/energy_and_technical_regulation/energy_efficiency/national_energy_efficiency_building_project/cross-industry_skills_training_project</a>{% endraw %}
