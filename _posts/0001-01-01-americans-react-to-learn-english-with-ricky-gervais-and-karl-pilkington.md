{% raw %}I make Callie watch &quot;Learn English&quot; with Ricky Gervais and Karl Pilkington.  She loves Karl so this was a no brainer.  Karl Pilkington might unintentionally be the funniest man on the planet.  ENJOY!<br /><br />Original Video: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw2bTpyHGCE">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xw2bTpyHGCE</a><br /><br />*Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for &quot;fair use&quot; for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
