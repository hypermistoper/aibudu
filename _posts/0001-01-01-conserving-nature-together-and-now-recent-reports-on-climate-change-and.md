{% raw %}Recent reports on climate change and biodiversity loss indicate that we have a very short timeline to respond to the planetary crisis. Combined commitment from various stakeholders such as the government, the private sector, and communities can ensure successful conservation when everyone does their part. Conservation International's Green Wall Project is a powerful success story of multi-stakeholder partnerships. <br />#MSIGxCIAP #PeopleNeedBiodiversity{% endraw %}
