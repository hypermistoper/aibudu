Dashwood Days is a vlog of the lives of Ellie Dashwood, an even-keeled intelligent future Ivy league student, and Marianne Dashwood, a fun-loving wannabe actress who thrives on drama. After the death of their father, the sisters lose everything and are forced to live as (gasp) average middle class Americans. Marianne and Ellie create enemies and friends as they adapt to their new lives. No matter where they go, secrets and scandal seem to follow these two sisters. Join the sisters as they sort out love and lust, desires and dreams, and deceit and reality. In the end, the true question is will Ellie and Marianne have enough sense and sensibility to get their happily ever afters?{% endraw %}
