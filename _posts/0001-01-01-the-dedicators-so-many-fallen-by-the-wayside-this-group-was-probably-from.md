{% raw %}This group was probably from Gary, Indiana. This is from one of two singles by the Dedicators on Bud Pressner's Staff label. This was Cliff Gober's group before he began on his solo career. If you haven't heard Gober's version of &quot;A Poor Wayfaring Stranger,&quot; you're in for a real treat. <br /><br />You can contact me at gospelon45@gmail.com.<br /><br />I am always interested in hearing from members of groups and their families, as well as anyone who can help tell the story of these groups. I try to incorporate biographical information about the groups whose records I post, but I often am not able to find as much as I'd like to. Names and biographies of group members, other groups that they played in, dates of releases, home cities of groups, information about labels, and stories about the groups are all great. The men and women who gave glory with this great music deserve to be remembered better. With the help of group members, their families, their friends, and their fans, we can help keep the stories of the amazing people behind this amazing music alive.<br /><br />My intent is to give people a way to hear this forgotten and hard to access music. All songs on this channel are recorded from my own collection. I do not own the copyright to this material. If you'd prefer that I not share the music you made or own the copyright for, please contact me at gospelon45@gmail.com. I'll promptly remove the video.{% endraw %}
