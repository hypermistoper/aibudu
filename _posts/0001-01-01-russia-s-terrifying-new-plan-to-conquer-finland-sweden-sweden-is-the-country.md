{% raw %}Sweden is the country you see in blue. It shares a border with Finland, which you see in<br />green. However, to the right of Finland is Russia, which you can see in red. Finland and<br />Russia share a 1,340 km long border. This border has become an issue for both Finland<br />and Sweden, as they have come under threat from Russia not to join NATO!<br />Finland, Sweden, and Russia are all European countries but are not members of NATO<br />and  Russia   is  not  likely  to  ever join.  However,  Russia  is extremely  wary of  its close<br />neighbors,   Finland   and   Sweden   joining   the   military   cooperation.   Russia   considers<br />NATO a threat to its sovereignty.<br />NATO   began   beefing   up  its   defenses   in   northeastern   Europe   after   Russia   annexed<br />Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula in 2014. Recently, some members have also sent troops,<br />aircraft,   and   warships   to   the   Black   Sea   region,   near   allies   Bulgaria,   Romania,   and<br />Turkey{% endraw %}
