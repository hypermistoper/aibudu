{% raw %}Whether you're twenty-five or sixty-five, figuring out what you're going to do next in life is a challenge. With great humour, Norman Bacal traces the river of his own journey through success to crashing failure and then to amazing rebirth. As a lawyer, firm builder, motivational speaker and bestselling author, Norman uses his own personal experiences to share advice on how to rebound after failure and set yourself up for success.  Norman Bacal built and led an iconic Canadian law firm, was among the pioneers of the financing of the Canadian film and television industry, and had the privilege of working with major Hollywood studios during his thirty-five year legal career. <br /><br />In 2016 he stepped away from practice to begin a second career as a motivational speaker, and consultant. He is a Globe and Mail and Amazon bestselling author of four books on leadership, career development and murder-mysteries. An eclectic combination. <br /><br />His proudest ongoing achievement, however, is mentoring students, developing professionals, and aspiring leaders across the country in an effort to pay forward the lessons that so enriched his own life. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
