This is Matt and I love turning trash into treasure. What we do here is take Nacho Stuff and turn it into cash. You see, many people have abandoned all kinds of random treasures and toss them into the trash. We take these lost valuables and figure out a way to make a buck from them. Sometimes it is simply reselling through Facebook marketplace or eBay and other times we might just scrap it. Either way, we are turning free stuff into cash and I think that is pretty cool and addictive. I prefer the curbside scene but occasionally find myself in a dumpster or two. Join me as I try to turn nothing into something.<br /><br />WHAT TO SEND ME SOMETHING! Please ue the following address: Nacho Stuff -  PO Box 498 Christmas, FL 32709 <br />Have a question?

Some call it picking while others consider it a true treasure hunt. But at the end of the day, like most scrappers, I am trying to reduce our waste while lining my pockets a little in the process. Each piece of scrap metal, item of curbside treasure or piece of dumpster loot means one less piece going into our landfills and that makes me happy. The fact that I can get paid for the effort is icing on the cake.
