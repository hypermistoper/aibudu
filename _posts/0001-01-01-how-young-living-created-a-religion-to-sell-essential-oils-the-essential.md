{% raw %}The essential oils cult I almost joined years ago, the multilevel marketing company (MLM) called Young Living Essential Oils, is dying. A new book called My Word Made Flesh, with close ties to its CEO Mary Young, is being called satanic, demonic, and occult by many of Young Living’s Christian distributors. This company has been marketing their products by integrating essential oils into Christian theology and New Thought ideology for years, but they’ve finally pushed this far enough to trigger a backlash. What Gary Young and David Stewart started with Healing Oils of the Bible, God’s Love Manifest in Molecules, and Raindrop technique, Mary Young and Marcella Vonn Harting have taken to its logical next step.<br /> <br />Check out The Antibot’s video “Young Living Accused of Being a Satanic Cult”<br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/5nYrjQQg6Gg">https://youtu.be/5nYrjQQg6Gg</a><br /> <br /> <br /><br /><br /><br />***Clarification here. Young Living did not *technically* release or distribute My Word Made Flesh. As with David Stewart's books, this book was written by *technically* independent persons, then distributed to many of their reps through high-ranking *technically* independent YL reps. YL CEO Mary Young wrote the book’s forward, and there’s a QR code in the book which takes you to a site where you can join Young Living. So did YL have a hand in creating and distributing this book? You decide.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-------------------------------------------FOLLOW-------------------------------------------<br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/gm_skeptic">https://twitter.com/gm_skeptic</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/GMSkeptic/">https://www.facebook.com/GMSkeptic/</a><br /><br /><br /><br />-------------------------------------------SUPPORT-------------------------------------------<br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/GeneticallyModifiedSkeptic">https://www.patreon.com/GeneticallyModifiedSkeptic</a><br />PayPal: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.me/GMSkeptic">https://www.paypal.me/GMSkeptic</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />-------------------------------------------Resources for atheists in need-------------------------------------------<br /><br /><br />Find a Secular Therapist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.seculartherapy.org">https://www.seculartherapy.org</a><br /><br />Recovering from Religion helps connect those who are leaving or have left their religion with support, resources and community: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.recoveringfromreligion.org/#rfr-welcome">https://www.recoveringfromreligion.org/#rfr-welcome</a><br /><br />Resources for Ex-Mu’s: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://exmuslims.org/join-us/">https://exmuslims.org/join-us/</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This video contains 100% therapeutic grade skepticism.*<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />*This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA{% endraw %}
