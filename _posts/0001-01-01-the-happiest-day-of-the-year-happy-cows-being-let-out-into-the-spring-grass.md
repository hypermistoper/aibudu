{% raw %}When i was a little boy i was placed in different homes during summer. I can remember a farm that i was on and the time when they let the cows out in early summer. The cows where mental and jumped around making all sort of sounds.  Yesterday Elna and i was invited to watch this years release and i had so much fun. We both love animals and seeing them happy makes us happy.<br />The location we where at was just amazing and i see now that i need to do more drone shots in the future. Cause Norway is so beautiful.<br /><br />Hope you all enjoy this video. If you do we hope you consider subscribing.<br /><br />Cameras: Panasonic GH5, DJI Osmo action and DJI Mavic Air<br />Music: Artlist<br /><br /><br />Love Bengt &amp; Elna{% endraw %}
