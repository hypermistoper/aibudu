{% raw %}In this video, we will be talking about the psychology behind reading jumbled words. More specifically, how typoglycemia, chunking, and predicting helps us decipher words and sentences.

The rest can be a total mess and you can still read it without problem. This is because the human mind does not read every letter by itself but the word as a whole.&quot;<br /><br />Now at first glance, this makes a lot of sense. <br /><br />Essentially, all of the words that I am writing right now have the first and last letter in the correct place.<br /><br />A cognitive process called typoglycemia helps us decode the inner letters of these words by using the outside letters as clues to what the word is.<br /><br />It should be noted that the theory behind typoglycemia only seems to be correct and is not widely studied.<br /><br />But having the first and last letter in the right place does not really tell the whole story.<br /><br />For example, let’s take the below words: teenage, council<br /><br />Pretty hard to decipher at first, right? <br /><br />Comment what you think the words are below. I want to see if you can guess them.<br /><br />While it is helpful to keep the first letter and last letter of each word in the correct place, it does not tell us the entire story when it comes to more complicated words that are more jumbled or less common.<br /><br />This is because our brain likes to predict what sentences are going to say.<br /><br />It is easy to read the sentence “I drove a car down the street”, but harder to read “I drove a car down the crocodile”.<br /><br />This is because the second sentence is never used and our brain has a hard time contextualizing the last word.<br /><br />The harder it is to predict, the harder it is to understand.<br /><br />Our brains also chunk information together to help decipher meanings. <br /><br />Chunking is the reason why you are not reading every individual letter when you read a sentence.<br /><br />Instead, you are reading every single word as a whole.<br /><br />This allows us to ignore spelling sometimes since we are seeing words as chunks.<br /><br />So let us review what your brain has to do in order to read what I’m writing right now.<br /><br />First, your brain has to chunk the letters in the word together to form a whole word.<br /><br />Then, it has to decode the word through typoglycemia.<br /><br />Finally, it has to predict what the next word will be in the sentence.<br /><br />And the process keeps repeating.<br /><br />In conclusion, it is fun to read jumbled words and our magical brains allow us to do it with general ease. <br /><br />If you got a headache from this video, don’t worry. I have the unjumbled version of the script in the description below.<br /><br />Thanks for watching and I’ll see you next time.{% endraw %}
