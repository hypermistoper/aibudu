{% raw %}Scientists have just discovered something massive in space but said it shouldn't be there. Today, we take a look at what scientists have just discovered in space.<br /><br />Space is a wondrous place full of excitement and adventure, filled with countless possibilities. What lurks beyond the stars is a question humanity has posed time and time again and with each passing day we are closer to uncovering its myriad of secrets.<br /><br />The Milky Way is our home; our little patch of space in which our solar system dwells. However, it is far from being the only galaxy near us. Seated at an estimated 820,00 light-years away from our very own green planet lies a tiny galaxy on the outskirts of the Milky Way. <br /><br />Thank you for watching!<br /><br />Thank you to CO.AG for the background music!{% endraw %}
