{% raw %}Song from The Corrs and Bryan White for the film &quot;Quest for Camelot&quot;.<br /><br /><br /><br />Look at the sky tell me what do you see<br /><br /><br /><br />Just close your eyes and describe it to me<br /><br /><br /><br />The heavens are sparkling with starlight tonight<br /><br /><br /><br />That's what I see through your eyes<br /><br /><br /><br />I see the heavens each time that you smile<br /><br /><br /><br />I hear your heartbeat just go on for miles<br /><br /><br /><br />And suddenly I know why life is worthwhile<br /><br /><br /><br />That's what I see through your eyes<br /><br /><br /><br />That's what I see through your eyes<br /><br /><br /><br />Here in the night, I see the sun <br /><br /><br /><br />Here in the dark, our two hearts are one<br /><br /><br /><br />Its out of our hands, we can't stop what we have begun<br /><br /><br /><br />And love just took me by surprise, looking through your eyes<br /><br /><br /><br />I see a night I wish could last forever<br /><br /><br /><br />I see a world we're meant to see together<br /><br /><br /><br />And it is so much more than I remember<br /><br /><br /><br />More than I remember<br /><br /><br /><br />More than I have known<br /><br /><br /><br />Here in the night, I see the sun<br /><br /><br /><br />Here in the dark, our two hearts are one<br /><br /><br /><br />Its out of our hands, we can't stop what we have begun<br /><br /><br /><br />And love just took me by surprise, looking through your eyes<br /><br /><br /><br />Looking through your eyes <br /><br /><br /><br />Looking through your eyes{% endraw %}
