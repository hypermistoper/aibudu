{% raw %}Audio | J. Krishnamurti - Rishi Valley 1977 - Public Talk 3 - Looking freely<br /><br />If I am caught in tradition I cannot possibly see what is actually happening.<br /><br />Is there an observation without the word?<br /><br />What is the quality of observation when the observer is the past?<br /><br />Thought is the response of registration, the imprint of time on the brain.<br /><br />What is the quality of the mind when there is no observer, only observation?<br /><br />Can consciousness become aware of itself, not ‘I’ becoming aware of my consciousness?<br /><br />If there is a cause or motive, that directs or distorts observation.<br /><br /><br />---<br /><br /><br /><br />This channel is managed by the Krishnamurti Foundation Trust​​, UK​, and by the Krishnamurti Foundation of America.<br /><br /><br /><br />The role of the foundations was described by Krishnamurti when he said,​ ​'The foundations will see to it that these teachings are kept whole, are not distorted, are not made corrupt. They will not give rise to any sectarian spirit in their activities... nor create any kind of place of worship around the teachings or the person.​'​<br /><br /><br /><br />We maintain extensive archives of Krishnamurti's original works and all four Krishnamurti foundations are actively engaged in the publication of material in various forms.<br /><br /><br /><br />Our videos contain thousands of subtitles in more than 25 languages, translated by volunteers from all over the world. If you would like to help us with translating subtitles, please contact us at digital@kfoundation.org<br /><br /><br /><br />For more information about J.
