{% raw %}Sometimes it can be intimidating to reach out and try something new for a first time! Yet if ever there was a time to do so, it would be now! With rising prices and shortages, now is the time to make the best use of your land and start doing more from the comfort of your kitchen. <br /><br />The process of making maple syrup turned out to be such a fun project as a family! It’s one of those things where you want the warm weather of spring but wish upon those cold winter nights.. it’s the magic that keeps the cycle of sap running. <br /><br />Thanks for watching! Don’t forget to subscribe if you wish to see more of our creations in the back woods, where we seek to utilize the best of our resources while living off-grid!{% endraw %}
