I've been busy and have fallen behind with painting my daily skies, so am trying to re-establish the habit, so will try to publish at least one sky painting a week here if I can! Check out my Sky practice playlist for more.<br />Here I use raw sienna, cobalt blue and paynes grey, along with various brushes, including my new  size 14 Escoda Ultimo synthetic mop brush, a pro art extra large Ron Ranson hake brush, a 3/4&quot; synthetic flat and a small unbranded caligraphy brush, My board is at an angle of about 45-60 degrees, my paper is Suanders Waterford cold pressed, taped to my board with ordinary decorators masking tape..<br />Many thanks to my lovely Patrons for your support!{% endraw %}
