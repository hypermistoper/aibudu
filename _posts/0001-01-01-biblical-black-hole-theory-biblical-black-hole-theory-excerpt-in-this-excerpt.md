{% raw %}Biblical Black Hole Theory | Excerpt - In this excerpt from my full length video 'The Archer: Antichrist Unveiled', I discuss my personal interpretation of Revelation 6:14 and what occurs when the Lord Jesus Christ opens the Sixth Seal there. This topic is meant only to be something of a side interest and not to be taken as dogmatic in any way whatsoever.<br /><br />Become a Patron of Theophilus Most Excellent here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheophilusMostExcellent">https://www.patreon.com/TheophilusMostExcellent</a><br /><br />Resources:<br /><br />The feature length video 'The Archer: Antichrist Unveiled':<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvN0jgwLQKY&amp;t=1134s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvN0jgwLQKY&amp;t=1134s</a><br /><br />As a side note, I encourage my Christian brothers who are interested to examine my Playlists section here on YouTube:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClh6ABQPVkU3N1fD7jb_6yA/playlists">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClh6ABQPVkU3N1fD7jb_6yA/playlists</a><br /><br />I have put together a lot of good material for the believing Christian, esp. the newborn Christian, categorizing it all the best I could. There is quite a lot of good material available, ranging from apologetics, which is reasons for faith and answers to difficulties regarding faith, to Biblical teaching, to in-depth examinations of various other worldviews, as well as videos exposing satanic teachings/teachers, occultism, New World Order/Illuminati type things and many many others.<br /><br />I hope the video edifies and builds up the Church of Christ. If you liked the material, feel free to subscribe to my channel for similar material in the future. I love all of you very much and I hope you're blessed in the Lord.<br /><br />Godspeed,<br />Theophilus{% endraw %}
