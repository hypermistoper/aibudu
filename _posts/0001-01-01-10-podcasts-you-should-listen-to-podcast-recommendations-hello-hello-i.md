{% raw %}Hello hello! I've been listening to podcasts for quite some time now (love to listen while I'm driving or getting tasks around the house done, or on walks!), and so I figured I would share some of the ones I love with you. I tried to make sure there was a decent variety of categories so hopefully you'll find something you like in this list to listen to (lifestyle, personal development / personal growth / self improvement , motivational , health , business , interviews , true crime, etc). Let me know what your favorite podcasts are down below in the comments, maybe it'll become a little section where we all discover new things to listen to :) <br /><br />âœ© In This Video âœ©<br />Mentioned that I listened to Armchair Expert on my previous video, my thoughts on one of the episodes starts at around the 6 minute mark here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6b7x4n5ys&amp;t=482s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qe6b7x4n5ys&amp;t=482s</a><br /><br />âœ© Social Media âœ©<br />Instagram and TikTok - @lina.lecompte<br />Twitter and Pinterest- @linalecompte<br /><br />âœ© Cameras/Equipment I Use âœ©<br />Canon 80D w/18-55mm lens - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3rQaGD6">https://amzn.to/3rQaGD6</a><br />Canon G7X Mark II - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3eynSZD">https://amzn.to/3eynSZD</a> <br />External Microphone for my Camera - Rode VideoMicro: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3tNg9vt">https://amzn.to/3tNg9vt</a><br />Voiceover Microphone - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3aAhIoZ">https://amzn.to/3aAhIoZ</a><br />(the above links are affiliate links - this means I earn a small commission at no extra cost to you!)<br /><br />âœ© Editing Software âœ©<br />Adobe Premiere Pro<br /><br />âœ© Music âœ©<br />Epidemic Sound<br />Use my referral link for a free month: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/qvu92n/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/qvu92n/</a>{% endraw %}
