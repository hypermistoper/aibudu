Then it's time for the news, and a story about the federal travel mask mandate has James and Ian telling stories about the most annoying people they've sat next to on planes. And after a discussion about why we can no longer bring pets to work, the team discusses why a certain photo of James was chosen to hang in our office.<br /><br />More Late Late Show:<br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/CordenYouTube">http://bit.ly/CordenYouTube</a><br />Watch Full Episodes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1ENyPw4">http://bit.ly/1ENyPw4</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://on.fb.me/19PIHLC">http://on.fb.me/19PIHLC</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1Iv0q6k">http://bit.ly/1Iv0q6k</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/latelategram">http://bit.ly/latelategram</a><br /><br />Watch The Late Late Show with James Corden weeknights at 12:35 AM ET/11:35 PM CT.

Corden differentiates his show by offering viewers a peek behind-the-scenes into the green room, bringing all of his guests out at once and lending his musical and acting talents to various sketches. Additionally, bandleader Reggie Watts and the house band provide original, improvised music throughout the show. Since Corden took the reigns as host in March 2015, he has quickly become known for generating buzzworthy viral videos, such as Carpool Karaoke.&quot;{% endraw %}
