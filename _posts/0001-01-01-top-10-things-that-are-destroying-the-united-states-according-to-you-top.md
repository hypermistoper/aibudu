{% raw %}Top 10 Things That Are Destroying the United States According to You. <br /><br />Over the last month, I have been running surveys on Google Surveys and have been asking people what they thought was the biggest problem we face in this country and what is destroying our way of life in the USA. I listed 40 popular issues the United States is dealing with these days like Health Care, inflation, politics, media, social media, and a bunch more. I took the findings and brought them to the community tabs of WA2B and asked you guys to ranks them. We had some good discussions going on. Surprisingly people for the most part were respectful. I say surprisingly because we get a lot of the political zealots on this channel. You see them in the comments section turning every video into an opportunity to slam one of the political parties. I could make a video about the cities with the worst pizza and they would leave a comment about how the pizza sucks there because of Liberals or Conservatives. But, when I asked these questions we didn’t get that much of that. And I have a theory. I think for most of us no matter where you are politically you want what’s best for our country. <br />  Ok, so is this the most scientific or statistical video? No, it is based on the opinion polls of people that watch my videos which had over 60k responses, and some surveys that had a little over 4000 responses. <br /><br />This is very interesting.
