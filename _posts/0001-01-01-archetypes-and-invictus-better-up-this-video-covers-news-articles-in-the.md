{% raw %}This video covers news articles in the lead up to the Invictus Games, I will be talking about their 'secret' visit to see the Queen and Charles and coverage of the Games in the next video xx<br /><br />Archetypes is a word I believe Meghan may run into issues with her latest bid to trademark the word due to the number of podcasts/ books that already exist, with that in their title.<br /><br />By playing constant media games, the Invictus has already turned into the Harry and Meghan show before it even started.<br /><br />It is not the Invictus athletes fault and I have nothing but respect for them, their families and truly wish them the best of luck and hope we win some medals!! 🏆🏆🏆{% endraw %}
