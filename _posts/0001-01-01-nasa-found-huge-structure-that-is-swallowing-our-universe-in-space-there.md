{% raw %}In space, there is indeed a lot of room. Although the stars may be impenetrable with today's technology, our perception of space shifts when we look at items the scale of stars and planets compared to elements the size of galaxies. The Milky Way, our galaxy, is a massive collection of billions of stars that spans a hundred thousand light-years and is 2.5 million light-years distant from Andromeda, another universe. Both galaxies are part of a cluster that includes a third, similar-sized galaxy and a swarm of many smaller galaxies. In this video, we will be discussing about the objects that astronomers captured.<br /><br />The Age and Structure of Individual Stars<br />When astronomers gaze out into the universe, they notice that galaxies frequently develop these clusters, gravitationally bonded to one another in the slowest do-si-do ever. The billions of light-years between galaxies, on the other hand, are insignificant in comparison to their sizes. And Andromeda would be only 150 feet away if our galaxy were shrunk to the measure of a six-foot-tall individual. As a result, while stars and planets seldom collide, galaxies do all the time. Because of the vast distances involved, astronomers can only see a snapshot of the extra light from all the stars in real-time. Even our most powerful telescopes can't see the weak detritus from these galactic hoe-downs. But Andromeda is so near that scientists can use spectra to determine the age and structure of individual stars. The illumination from other stars can be stretched out into their rainbows, much as the light from the Sun may be split out into different hues by raindrops. Each component in a star resists specific wavelengths of light, leaving a spectrum fingerprint of absent shades.{% endraw %}
