{% raw %}Parking in your garage, in a carport or an underground parking garage – a daily ritual for many car owners. The home zone park assist from Bosch can automate repeated parking procedures. The driver teaches the system the exact route just once by driving the desired route manually. With the beginning and the end of the training the start and end positions are each defined. When the vehicle reaches the start position again, the home zone park assist can drive the vehicle the trained route to the target parking space. The driver monitors the whole vehicle movement – and can stop it at any time. He decides whether to operate the system from either inside the vehicle or from outside via smartphone.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />This movie shows Bosch’s own technology. The vehicle depicted was selected for demonstration purposes only. The movie also shows solutions that are not yet available, or not universally, or that will not be universally available. The use of automated parking functions might not be permitted in your jurisdiction or might be permitted according to further or deviating legislative restrictions. Please always comply with the applicable national road traffic regulations and take safety precautions as advised.{% endraw %}
