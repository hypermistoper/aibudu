{% raw %}For aeons, humans have sought out systems of meaning to make sense of the patterns of our lives. In recent years, there’s been a resurgence and reclaiming of mysticism and alternative practices such as astrology, tarot and manifestation, particularly among women, non-binary people, queer communities and communities of colour. <br /><br />These practices can provide spiritual and practical direction and pathways to success, and help us understand our place in the world – but they’re also derided and dismissed by many.<br /><br />At this Broadly Speaking event, we heard from journalist and ‘sceptical believer’ Amal Awad, creative producer and tarot oracle Erica McCalman, poet and musician Lay the Mystic, and podcaster, entrepreneur and self-described ‘spooky binch’ Lillian Ahenkan (aka Flex Mami). Together, they unpacked the joy and purpose of mystic pursuits, considered the intersections of spirituality and self-awareness, and explored the roots of mainstream disbelief. Hosted by Shantel Wetherall.<br /><br />Presented in partnership with The Capitol and RMIT Culture.<br /><br />The Broadly Speaking series is proudly supported by Krystyna Campbell-Pretty AM and family and the Copyright Agency Cultural Fund.{% endraw %}
