Also, our brains resist a sudden change and we get emotional conform from following the same old ways. Therefore, creating a lasting behavioural change is not easy.<br /><br />If you are fed up with this yo-yo effect and want to gradually create a lasting change, then you might want to consider learning from a neuroscientist and performance coach Dr Gabija Toleikyte about what conditions does your brain need to activate neuroplasticity and create a lasting behavioural change.<br /><br />In this talk you will learn:<br /><br />Which parts of the brain are responsible for creating and maintaining old habits?<br />Which parts of the brain are required for creating a lasting change?<br />What is neuroplasticity and when is it active?<br />A brain-based explanation on why we fall back to old habits<br />Brain-based practical tips on how to create lasting behavioural changes.<br /><br />Recommended reading:<br /><br />The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg<br />The Brain That Changes Itself by Norman Doidge <br />Brain Rules by John Medina<br />Mindset by Carol Dweck<br /><br />Dr Gabija Toleikyte is a neuroscientist and business coach.
