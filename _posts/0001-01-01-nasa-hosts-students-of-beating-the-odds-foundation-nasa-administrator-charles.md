{% raw %}NASA Administrator Charles Bolden welcomed this year’s Beating the Odds Foundation/Student Success and Leadership Program participants to NASA HQ.  They heard from Human Research Program Director for the Twin Study, Dr. John Charles and planetary scientist, Dr. Shawn Domagal-Goldman, who discussed NASA’s search for life in the Universe.  Student teams presented results of research they conducted on the Twin Study using the Foundation’s Stepping Stones to Success model.  This informal partnership between NASA Headquarters and the Beating the Odds Foundation, now in its third year, demonstrates the effectiveness of integrating formal education and NASA missions.{% endraw %}
