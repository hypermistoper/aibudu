But do you know exactly what they changed when they moved in?!<br /><br />Kim and Kanye’s $60 million dollar mansion is back in the headlines now that they’re getting divorced. They bought the home for a cool $20 million dollars in 2014, and now it’s worth three times that! Kim has described the house as her dream home, and the couple have said the aesthetic is “futuristic Belgian monastery.”<br /><br />Creative designers Kanye, James Turrell, Claudio Silvestrin and not to mention illustrious Belgian designer, Axel Vervoordt, have all had a hand in making the 15,000 square foot home what it is today. The home seems to be a lot of different shades of beige… but what did it look like before the two mega stars moved in?<br /><br /><br />Would you have made the same changes to this house!?
