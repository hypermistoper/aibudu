{% raw %}The last stronghold of Ukrainian troops in the south-east of the country, appears to be very close to falling — but by Sunday afternoon the forces loyal to Kyiv were still holding out.<br /><br />Russia has given Ukrainian soldiers in the area, a chilling ultimatum to &quot;surrender or die&quot;. A Russian defence ministry spokesman has warned that &quot;all those who continue resistance will be destroyed&quot;. But Ukraine’s deputy defence minister said that the key port was still holding despite the continuing Russian attacks.<br /><br />Hanna Malyar said on Sunday that the Russians have continued to hit Mariupol with air raids and were possibly preparing an amphibious landing to beef up their forces in the city.{% endraw %}
