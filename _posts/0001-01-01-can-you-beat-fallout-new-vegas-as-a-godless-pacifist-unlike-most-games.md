{% raw %}Unlike most games Fallout: New Vegas lets you kill pretty much anyone you want. And that’s great and all, but only an insane person would kill someone in a video game for no reason. That’s why I always do the right thing.

(in text form)<br /><br />First we must ask ourselves what a Godless Pacifist is. The best way to explain it is to say what this challenge was supposed to be: Can You Beat Fallout: New Vegas Without Attacking Anything and Without Taking Any Damage. That might sound lame but give me 2 minutes and I’ll prove to you that God was nowhere to be found in this challenge.<br /><br />After Doc Mitchell gave birth to me, I picked Maurice as my name as a high tier reference, did a re-enactment of God making my brother, not me you've seen how pretty Paulina and her children is. FOR SPECIAL, I went with what felt accurate. It's been a long time since I've cheesed my way through New Vegas with  Speech.

Chems, a Hasbro make your own chems kit, and armor for cosmic benefits or minor stat advantages are it. I initially wasn't sure how I wanted to handle this, if I wanted to see how much of the main quest line I could complete or if I wanted to just beat the game as quickly as possible. I hit Jean's Sky Diving and decided to turn around and inadvertently cause a bloodbath. The experience would be very satisfying for me. <br /><br />But I noticed something on my map, a Vault just outside of Goodsprings that I'd never seen before. Vault 28. Down the manhole I went. With each step down the ladder I went, it felt like the hairs on my neck were trying to fly away. I pressed onward, one foot in front of the other just like Lord said. When I got down there, a combination of emotions hit me that cannot be described with words. I accidentally stumbled into the...{% endraw %}
