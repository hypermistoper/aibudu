{% raw %}Πάντα το σίδερο η το ξύλο, που θα βάλουμε για να δέσουμε το σφιγκτήρα, να είναι πιο γερό σε αντοχή από το στραβό που θέλουμε να ισιώσουμε ,σας ευχαριστώ, αν θέλετε εγγραφείτε στο κανάλι μου<br /> <br /><br />Depending on the metal, you can either straighten it to it's original form or restore just the main form of the beam, and then work on it to restore the outer shape. If the metal post is from solid metal, this method is not realy applicable. But if it is a hollow square pipe, then it can be restored to it's original shape.  <br /><br />You'll need something to pull the bent pipe back to it's original position, and also some kind of frame that will help you perform the pull. <br /><br />Two wooden beams and a third thicker one is needed to form a frame around the bend. <br />Place the two smaller beams horizontaly on top and bottom, and the third one verticaly, oposite to the bend. <br />Run thick, hard wire around the vertical wooden pole and around the bent metal, exactly at the point of the bend, making two hoops around them to help you pull them together. <br />Make sure they are connected securely because they will be taking all the load of the pulling.  <br />Now take a double hook turnbuckle and &quot;catch&quot; the two wire hoops you 've made, and start turning the buckle to pull them together. Slowly the bent beam will start getting straihgt. <br />When you see it reaching the initial form, check to see how straight it is and you can stop pulling. <br />Whatever further work needed on the pole can be done afterwards, to restore the initial face and sides. <br /><br />Point to remember: The vertical wooden pole must be stronger than the bent metal beam. <br /><br />Thanks for watching, and if  you like what you see, consider subscribing.{% endraw %}
