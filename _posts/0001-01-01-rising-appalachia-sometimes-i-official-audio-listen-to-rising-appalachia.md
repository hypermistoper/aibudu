{% raw %}Listen to Rising Appalachia's new single, Sometimes I, out now: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://smarturl.it/SometimesI">https://smarturl.it/SometimesI</a><br /><br />“Sometimes I” is a song of nostalgia... of longing...a love of home, and of place.

A song about all the many times where we have longed to return somewhere, to return to a home of sorts. This is a concept that didn’t always wait for us at the other end of our journeys, a home that was not always there. <br /><br />It is also celebration of self, a reclamation of that infinite home that resides inward. That sometimes the deepest depths of beauty can break you wide open, and the tiniest touch of wind can bring you down to your knees in reverence. <br /><br />It is a song about the raw mastication of love. What happens when that freight train takes you over, tiny spout and muddy river...<br />Whisper softly, softly now...<br /><br />It has taken us a long time to find the right voicing of this song, to find the place where it’s full girth can swell and soar. I believe we have that here, and finally, present you the form of this song that has wanted to come through for many years. Let it serve you in these rocky times to bring you back to your inner sense of home. <br />We present to you “Sometimes I “<br />-----<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.risingappalachia.com/">https://www.risingappalachia.com/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/RisingAppalachiaMusic">https://www.facebook.com/RisingAppalachiaMusic</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/RisingApp">https://twitter.com/RisingApp</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/risingappalachia/">https://www.instagram.com/risingappalachia/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://linktr.ee/risingappalachia">https://linktr.ee/risingappalachia</a>{% endraw %}
