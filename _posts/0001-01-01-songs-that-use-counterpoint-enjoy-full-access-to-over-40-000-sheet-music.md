It is most commonly found in Baroque music, however we can find examples of contrapuntal writing in pop and rock music too.<br /><br />For this video I decided to forego my usual Patreon outro and instead feature a rendition of the Ukrainian national anthem which I've arranged. I've also decided to donate the Patreon proceeds from this video to Save The Children's work in Ukraine.<br /><br />And, an extra special thanks goes to Douglas Lind, Vidad Flowers, Ivan Pang, Waylon Fairbanks, Jon Dye, Austin Russell, Christopher Ryan, Toot &amp; Paul Peijzel, the channelâ€™s Patreon saints! ðŸ˜‡<br /><br />SUPPORT ME ON PATREON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/davidbennettpiano">https://www.patreon.com/davidbennettpiano</a> ðŸŽ¹<br /><br />0:00 Introduction &amp; Bach<br />1:04 &quot;God Only Knows&quot; by The Beach Boys<br />2:23 Homophony Vs.
