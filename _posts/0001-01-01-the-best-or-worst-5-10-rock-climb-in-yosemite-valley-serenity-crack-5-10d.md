{% raw %}A stormy Sunday in Yosemite Valley took us up Serenity Crack. The best 5.10 multi-pitch crack climb in the Valley.  Yes, pin scars are to thank for this classic climb going at such a moderate grade.  <br />If you have another suggestion- please mention in the comment section below.  <br />Starting off with a slight runout on 5.8ish terrain, the first pitch clocks in around 5.10a with a PG13 rating.  The climbing is very mellow, but you don't get a bomber piece until ~35 feet up. No real crux on pitch 1. <br />Pitch 2 starts out with more beautiful finger locks and has one 5.10- step across which can be protected with a high placement. <br />Pitch 3 is somehow better than the first two and features an absolutely beautiful hand crack up to a splitter finger lock section with delicate footwork.  Pro is abundant and bomber.  <br />An amazing climb for any confident 5.10 leader, although pitch 1 might be a bit exciting for those faint of heart.<br /><br />For Business Inquiries Email: Hysell.30@gmail.com <br />Instagram: @GravityLabOfficial{% endraw %}
