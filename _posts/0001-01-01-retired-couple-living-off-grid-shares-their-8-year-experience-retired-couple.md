The building code where they live requires an automatic heat source that can come on even if no one is home, and they also know that one day they may not want to cut as much firewood.<br /><br />For now, they harvest and process all of their own firewood themselves, cutting down trees in winter, and cutting them in the spring.<br /><br />Thanks for watching!<br /><br />Mat &amp; Danielle<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />STAY IN TOUCH!<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Blog: www.exploringalternatives.ca<br />Facebook: /exploringalternativesblog<br />Instagram: @exploringalternatives<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br />COMMENTS<br />-------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />We want our channel and our comments section to be an inclusive space where everyone feels welcome to watch and to contribute.
