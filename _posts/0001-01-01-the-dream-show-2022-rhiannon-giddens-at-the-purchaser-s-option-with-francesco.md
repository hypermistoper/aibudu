{% raw %}Grammy Award-winner Rhiannon Giddens has long lifted forgotten Black voices in American music. Her research and performance of slave songs have brought us powerful stories today. Her interpretation of wide-ranging music from other cultures shows us just how close we all are. <br /><br />Here’s one of her stunning originals, the tragic and defiant anthem “At the Purchaser’s Option,” performed alongside her partner Francesco Turrisi. <br /><br />The Dream Show was produced by MLK Community Healthcare (MLKCH) to celebrate South LA's history, resilience, and community. MLKCH is a health system dedicated to improving the health of South LA residents by providing both quality patient care and community-based programs that address South LA's most pressing health problems. <br /><br />Learn more at www.mlkch.org<br /><br />Follow us @yourMLKCH #TheDreamShowSouthLA #MLKCH <br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/yourmlkch/">https://www.facebook.com/yourmlkch/</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/yourMLKCH/">https://www.instagram.com/yourMLKCH/</a> <br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/yourmlkch">https://twitter.com/yourmlkch</a>{% endraw %}
