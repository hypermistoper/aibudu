{% raw %}In a quest to take control of my home I am finally addressing the clutter that is my sewing supplies! I have a big Kallax unit in my hallway, taking up half the home, and it is out of control! I need to move it anyway to paint and so I thought I'd take you on the journey to decluttering! I am also selling a few things so if there is anything that takes your fancy, leave me a comment and I will let you know if its available.<br /><br />I am so excited to get that area of my home looking fresh again! You get a tiny sneak peak at the kitchen but I am saving the reveal for another video!<br /><br />Please note, this is not all of my supplies as you'll see in future videos. Please like, comment, subscribe and share and help me get through this period of change on my channel!<br /><br />#declutter #craftstash #chronicillness<br /><br />**Support the channel**<br /><br />If you got extra value out of my videos and would like to leave a ‘tip’, this would be very much appreciated.
