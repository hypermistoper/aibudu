{% raw %}Bill Barr is on his reputation rehabilitation tour. In an interview with the Today Show's Savannah Guthrie, Barr talks about the evidence of Donald Trump's criminal intent in connection with trying to corruptly overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. <br /><br />There is no question but that the Department of Justice should subpoena Bill Barr to the grand jury in a criminal investigation of Donald Trump. The only legitimate reason DOJ might opt not to subpoena Barr is if federal prosecutors intend to indict Barr and then use him as a cooperating witness. <br /><br />For our Team Justice and Justice Matters merchandise shop, please visit: <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shop.spreadshirt.com/glennkirschner/">https://shop.spreadshirt.com/glennkirschner/</a><br /><br />Please consider becoming a #TeamJustice patron at:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/glennkirschner">https://www.patreon.com/glennkirschner</a><br /><br />My podcast, &quot;Justice Matters with Glenn Kirschner&quot; can be downloaded where you get your podcasts.
