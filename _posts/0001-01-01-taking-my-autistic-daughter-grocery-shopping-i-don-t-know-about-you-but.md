{% raw %}I don't know about you, but I (David) don't really like grocery shopping. But when it is with our autistic daughter Braylee, I absolutely love it. Giving her a cart and giving her the freedom to choose what she wants off the shelves is not only a way to develop independence, it gives us insight into her world. How she sees and interacts with her environment. She is in a throwing phase right now so groceries get thrown into the cart... Even the eggs. #weefam #autistic<br /><br />Like this video?
