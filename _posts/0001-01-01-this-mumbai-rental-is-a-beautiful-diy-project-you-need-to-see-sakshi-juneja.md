{% raw %}Sakshi Juneja is an expert at creating safe spaces for India’s queer community through the online media platform Gaysi. When the pandemic began in March 2020, Sakshi decided to move into her partner Naina Narang’s apartment to keep her company for the first few weeks of the lockdown. As weeks turned into months, the three-bedroom apartment in Bandra also multitasked as an office, eventually becoming the first home together for the two. Since Naina, a brand marketing executive and design enthusiast, had already been renting the three-bedroom apartment for over three years, the apartment owner trusted the couple with making a few structural changes to suit their lifestyle as well as complete liberty over design to redecorate the home.<br />The couple took on the refurb as something of a DIY project, working closely with the contractor chosen by their landlord and an informal collaboration with a close friend and interior design consultant, Shital Deliwala.<br />The couple cleverly incorporated designs and layout to suit their social as well as personal lifestyle.<br />Click the link here to read more about this DIY home designed by Sakshi and Naina!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.beautifulhomes.com/living/homes/this-mumbai-rental-is-a-beautiful-diy-project-you-need-to-see.html">https://www.beautifulhomes.com/living/homes/this-mumbai-rental-is-a-beautiful-diy-project-you-need-to-see.html</a><br /><br />For more home tours, house design inspirations and design ideas, check out our social media handles!<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/34s2hwu-bhfacebook">http://bit.ly/34s2hwu-bhfacebook</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/3kybY1T-bh-instagram">http://bit.ly/3kybY1T-bh-instagram</a>{% endraw %}
