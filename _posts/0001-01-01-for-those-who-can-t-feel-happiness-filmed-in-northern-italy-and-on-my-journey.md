{% raw %}Filmed in Northern Italy and on my journey to get there from Greece.<br /><br />A blasphemous prayer about happiness and the abyss, a journey within us mentioning the intricacies I find interesting while leaving out the noise of dogmatism. An imperfect poem that will be forgotten from all minds except the ones that treat humans with the respect a complete being deserves.<br /><br />ðŸ”°Support me on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/illneas">https://www.patreon.com/illneas</a><br /><br />ðŸ”°Find me here ðŸ”—<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/_illneas/">https://www.instagram.com/_illneas/</a><br />                            ðŸ”—<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/illneas/">https://www.facebook.com/illneas/</a><br />                            ðŸ”—<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/illneas">https://twitter.com/illneas</a><br />                            ðŸ”—<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6RXfBqGg0YwfM7jVCTq79W?si=hyG3S2oXTH-7HW_pIsH_zw">https://open.spotify.com/artist/6RXfBqGg0YwfM7jVCTq79W?si=hyG3S2oXTH-7HW_pIsH_zw</a><br /><br />Second channel<br />ðŸ”—<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3urbsMSDr9XmgtnFdWZe_Q">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3urbsMSDr9XmgtnFdWZe_Q</a><br /><br />ðŸ”°Communities <br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/kfxthmS3F4">https://discord.gg/kfxthmS3F4</a><br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2314655172176122/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/2314655172176122/</a><br />-<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/searchingformeaning/">https://www.reddit.com/r/searchingformeaning/</a><br /><br />ðŸ”°References <br /><br />-The narrator is Iness J<br />Her email.<br />ðŸ”—ijprojects.side@gmail.com<br /><br />-The music was created by prodbyIOF<br /><br />ðŸ”°My equipment: <br />I film handheld with a Panasonic Lumix <br />G80<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2uGqmQZ">https://amzn.to/2uGqmQZ</a><br />GX80<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/33e5Tye">https://amzn.to/33e5Tye</a><br />ðŸ“·Olympus M.Zuiko Digital 45mm F1.8 Lens  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2vr9P3N">https://amzn.to/2vr9P3N</a><br /><br />ðŸ”°For Those Who Can't Feel Happiness by illneas<br /><br />Like a prisoner behind bars, you will see her eyes <br /><br />Trapped beneath the surface of the poem you write,<br />she shivers <br /><br />She comes uninvited<br />and leaves without a warning<br /><br />Like an optical illusion, she appears and disappears <br /><br />Like a coincidence only you know how to understand <br /><br />The feeling she gave you stays<br />despite the darkness of your heart that tries to erase it<br /><br />Those who are searching for her <br />are doomed to never find her <br /><br />And those who stopped searching,<br />need her the most <br /><br />The rest of us stand in-between,<br />the need to hold her again, <br />and the need to forget she ever existed <br /><br />We create prisons of art <br />and display her proudly to the world,<br />pretending we are fine without her smile<br /><br />One day she will escape from the confinement you designed for her <br /><br />The moment you feel everything around you with the same intensity <br />as her presence <br /><br />When you cry and despite the pain <br />you feel lucky for each gasping breath <br /><br />When you feel broken <br />but somehow find the courage to observe the pain of others <br /><br />She will realize that the canvases,<br />the melodies,<br />or anything you put your soul into <br />cannot fully describe her<br /><br />She will take that phantom step into the real world <br />with chains still on her wrists<br /><br />Just to observe you cry <br /><br />Just to touch your scars <br /><br />You will stand on the edge of the abyss <br />ready to jump <br /><br />Without saying a word <br />Like your prisoner <br />she will approach you, uninvited<br />and before she leaves without a warning <br /><br />You will glimpse <br />that painfully beautiful thing called <br /><br />happiness{% endraw %}
