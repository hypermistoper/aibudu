{% raw %}üïí 02/19 11am<br />This is a walking video but totally inside of the building. I finally visited one of teamLab though I expected filming to be prohibited. Surprisingly it's OK though staff complained about my camera size expecting I will swing with it around like a club.<br />The place is big enough to spend more than an hour here. I cut a few places because they were too dark. Many areas change over time and could be revisited for new experience. Ticket price is 3200 yen. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://borderless.teamlab.art/">https://borderless.teamlab.art/</a><br /><br /><br />üó∫Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rambalac.com/wmap?ll=35.62718401174608%2C139.78218533325065&amp;z=17">https://rambalac.com/wmap?ll=35.62718401174608%2C139.78218533325065&amp;z=17</a><br /><br />JR Pass: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://click.jrpass.com/SH2z">https://click.jrpass.com/SH2z</a><br /><br />Camera: Sony FX3 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3rPZTc1">https://amzn.to/3rPZTc1</a><br />Settings: 4K 60p HLG3, 1/100, MF and AF<br />Lens: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3te44P2">https://amzn.to/3te44P2</a><br />Stabilizer: DJI RS2 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/38FVNM1">https://amzn.to/38FVNM1</a><br />Mic: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35REFlg">https://amzn.to/35REFlg</a><br />Time&amp;GPS tracking: Garmin Epix Gen 2 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/35A5PzS">https://amzn.to/35A5PzS</a><br />Drone: DJI Mavic 3 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/33QZu23,">https://amzn.to/33QZu23,</a> DJI Mavic 2 Pro <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3uL9q4R">https://amzn.to/3uL9q4R</a><br />* JR Pass and Amazon links above are affiliated.
