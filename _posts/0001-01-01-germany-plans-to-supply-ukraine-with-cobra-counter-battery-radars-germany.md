{% raw %}Germany plans to supply Ukraine with COBRA counter-battery radars<br /><br />Germany’s Federal Government intends to send COBRA artillery-locating radar systems over to Ukraine.<br />According to information published on the website of the German newspaper Die Welt, Ukraine has requested the supply of 40 COBRA radars.<br />However, only 3 to 5 systems out of 19 in the Bundeswehr stock could be available for delivery to Ukraine.<br />The cost of each is about 50 million euros.<br />This new potential supply of military equipment to Ukraine came to the line after Germany announced its supply of 155-mm PzH 2000 self-propelled howitzers for Ukraine.<br />The counter-battery radar system was developed jointly by Thales, Airbus Defence and Space, and Lockheed Martin for the German Armed Forces, the French Army, and the British Army. <br />COBRA counter-artillery detection radar is considered the world’s most advanced land-based weapon locating system, comprising a high-performance radar, advanced processing, and integrated, flexible command, control, and communication system. <br />The design includes state-of-the-art digital processing and an advanced active, solid-state phased array antenna consisting of several thousand transmit/receive modules.<br />The COBRA’s mission is to locate mortars, rocket launchers, and artillery batteries, and to provide information for countering their effectiveness. <br />With a detection range up to 100 km, COBRA is capable of locating and classifying up to 40 batteries in two minutes.<br />It was previously reported that according to the United States, they are also handing over the artillery reconnaissance radars for Ukraine.{% endraw %}
