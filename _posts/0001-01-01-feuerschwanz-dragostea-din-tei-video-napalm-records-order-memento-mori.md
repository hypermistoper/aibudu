{% raw %}Order 'Memento Mori' here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://smarturl.it/FS-MementoMori">https://smarturl.it/FS-MementoMori</a><br /><br />German medieval folk metal force FEUERSCHWANZ just entered the Official German Album Charts on #1. Now, they already releasing their next video – the cover version of O-Zone’s 2004 summer hit “Dragostea Din Tei”, taken from the Memento Mori Bonus album, Die Glorreichen Sieben.   <br /><br />FEUERSCHWANZ once again shows their exceptional ability to make non-metal songs their own. The combination between metal music archetypes and dance rhythms is simply irresistible for any music enthusiast – it is simply impossible not to sing along to this track! <br /><br />FEUERSCHWANZ on “Dragostea Din Tei”:<br />“When we decided to cover this song, we also did not know where the journey will go! In the end, it became a horde of Vikings, who row to Mallorca to party hard at the Ballermann! In addition, the song is a special premiere – our first song in Romanian!”<br /><br /><br />#Feuerschwanz{% endraw %}
