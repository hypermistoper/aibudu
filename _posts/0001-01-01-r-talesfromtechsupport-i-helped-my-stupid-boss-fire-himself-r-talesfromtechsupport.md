{% raw %}r/Talesfromtechsupport In today's episode, the new boss in an IT department decides that he's the most important person there, so he literally steals another worker's email. Unfortunately for Mr. Boss, this new email address gets Very Important emails that must be addressed immediately. The worker tries to warn his boss about these emails, but the boss ignores him. Eventually, the inevitable happens and the company gets into huge trouble because somebody was ignoring those Very Important emails.
