{% raw %}Everything in our lives is energy. So it makes sense that we could have unwanted energy from an argument, a neighbor, or other source come into our personal energy. <br /><br />Bad energy can make you tired, sad, irritable and can also block good things coming to you. <br /><br />In this video, I show you multiple ways to get rid of bad, negative or harmful energy and how to protect yourself and your space. <br /><br />For a psychic or mediumship reading click below:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://susan-lynn-psychic---medium.square.site/">https://susan-lynn-psychic---medium.square.site/</a><br /><br />Thanks for watching!  <br />Please consider sharing this video with friends or family that you feel may benefit from it. <br /><br />Thanks and Blessings, <br />Susan Lynn<br />Psychic Medium<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />.<br />#badenergyremoval<br />#removenegativeenergy<br />#protection<br />#spiritualprotection<br />#sage<br />#tibetansingingbowl<br />#spaceclearing<br />#susanlynnpsychicmedium{% endraw %}
