It provides for the legal, non-licensed citation or incorporation of copyrighted material in another author’s work under a four-factor balancing test.  The term “fair use” originated in the United States.  A similar principle, fair dealing, exists in some other common law jurisdictions.  Civil law jurisdictions have other limitations and exceptions to copyright. <br /><br />U.S. COPYRIGHT OFFICE- FAIR USE DEFINITION<br /><br />(Source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html)">http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl102.html)</a><br /><br />One of the rights accorded to the owner of copyright is the right to reproduce or to authorize others to reproduce the work in copies or phonorecords.  This right is subject to certain limitations found in sections 107 through 118 of the copyright law (title 17, U.S. Code).  One of the more important limitations is the doctrine of “fair use”.  The doctrine of fair use has developed through a substantial number of court decisions over the years and has been codified in section 107 of the copyright law. <br /><br />Section 107 contains a list of the various purposes for which the reproduction of a particular work may be considered fair, such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.<br /><br />————<br /><br />I don’t answer questions • First Amendment • Cops • Police • Cop Watch • id Refusal • Audit<br /><br />#arizona #cops #police{% endraw %}
