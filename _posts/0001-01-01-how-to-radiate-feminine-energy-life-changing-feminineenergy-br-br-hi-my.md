{% raw %}#feminineenergy <br /><br />Hi, my name is Jasmyne, and I love being a woman. I think every woman should love being a woman. Weâ€™ve been blessed with an unbridled innate feminine essence that allows us to be profoundly intuitive, warm, compassionate, soft, and magnetic. I feel that as women, we do a disservice to ourselves and we lose power when we try to imitate men and try to do only as men do because as feminine beings, we pull so much of our purpose from our feminine activity.<br />The fact that the sexes have opposite yet complementary energy is a beautiful thing and men and women interact the best together when they each practice their natural, viscous masculine and feminine energy. I have faith that the two polar energies are an intentional creation. <br /><br />Unfortunately, we women haven't been educated about what it means to be a woman. How to conduct yourself as a woman. How to take advantage of our innate feminine gifts - I went most of my life without even hearing the word &quot;femininity&quot; and therefore, I didn't know really what it means to be a woman - how women are different from men and vice versa. My goal is to help educate women about femininity so we can take advantage of our divinely-given feminine gifts &amp; inclinations so that we can lead joyous, fulfilling lives.<br /><br />Timestamps/chapters:<br />I.
