{% raw %}Bacterial Disease | Health | Biology | FuseSchool<br /><br />Did you know that it wasn’t until around 200 years ago that people knew what caused infectious diseases? Before that, they believed that one cause was ‘bad air’, and so they carried around bunches of sweet-smelling flowers to sweeten the scent of the air and prevent disease. <br /><br />Thanks to the invention of the microscope, and the experiments carried out by scientists, we now know that infectious diseases are caused by pathogens such as viruses and bacteria.<br /><br />In this video we’re going to look at how bacteria can cause disease in humans.<br /><br />CONTENT<br />0:00 intro<br />0:06 history of bacterial diseases<br />0:27 causes of infectious diseases<br />0:39 what are bacteria?<br />0:55 salmonella food poisoning<br />1:29 gonorrhoea<br />2:13 tuberculosis (TB)<br />2:45 stomach ulcers<br />3:22 conclusion<br /><br /><br />CREDITS<br />Animation &amp; Design: Reshenda Wakefield<br />Narration: Dale Bennett<br />Script: Gemma Young<br /><br />SUBSCRIBE to the FuseSchool YouTube channel for many more educational videos.
