If you don't have scraps to use I'll leave links below to the materials you'll need.<br /><br />Material:<br />- Membrane 10 Nylon (1 yard): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2qCeVUF">http://bit.ly/2qCeVUF</a><br />- Climashield Apex Insulation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2yXcQaJ">http://bit.ly/2yXcQaJ</a><br />- Grosgrain Ribbon (0.5&quot; wide): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2F9DlPz">http://bit.ly/2F9DlPz</a><br />- Gutermann Mara 70 Thread: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2k6mDmO">http://bit.ly/2k6mDmO</a><br /><br />The song in this video is by Exicious - Aestheticly Ethereal (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/exicious)">https://soundcloud.com/exicious)</a><br /><br />Link to my Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/backcountrybanter/">https://www.instagram.com/backcountrybanter/</a><br /><br />Shop my store for gear recommendations and ideas: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/backbanter">https://www.amazon.com/shop/backbanter</a><br /><br />Subscribe and follow me on social media for more updates like this.<br />Or, support me on Patreon and get access to even more content!<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.BackcountryBanter.com">http://www.BackcountryBanter.com</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/JoeBrewer">https://www.patreon.com/JoeBrewer</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/backcountrybanter">https://www.facebook.com/backcountrybanter</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/BackBanter">https://twitter.com/BackBanter</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/backcountrybanter/">https://www.instagram.com/backcountrybanter/</a>{% endraw %}
