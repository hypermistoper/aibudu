{% raw %}#watchcollection #catch22<br />I love watches, there are many watches I want to buy. But I also don't like having a large collection. So my watch desires are at odds with my collection preferences. So what do I do? Not buy as much? Flip more? Get over it? Can anyone relate? At the end of the day this isn't a real problem. This is a silly luxury. I recognize that. This hobby is supposed to be fun... right?<br /><br />Join my Patreon and Discord:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/brucewilliams">https://www.patreon.com/brucewilliams</a>{% endraw %}
