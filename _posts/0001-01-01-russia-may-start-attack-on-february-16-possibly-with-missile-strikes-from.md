{% raw %}USA communicated to allies that Russia can start physical assault on Ukraine on Wednesday, February 16, and that the assault can be preceded by a barrage of missile strikes and cyberattacks.<br /><br />The alarming sequence of recent events suggests that the missile attack can start from the territory of Belarus, which is closest to Ukraine’s capital Kyiv. Russia has relocated 30,000 troops to Belarus, together with 2 battalions of S-400 missile systems, where it is conducting “military training” on February 10-20. <br /><br />A staged attack “by Ukrainian drone” with casualties among Russian and Belarusian soldiers may give Russia “justification” to start a missile or air attack on Ukraine, and at the same time it will give “justification” for Belarus dictator to allow Russia to use its territory and airdromes. <br /><br />Read more:<br />1) about Russia’s fake attack video:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/ukraine-russia-fake-attack-video-us-claims#:~:text=US%20officials%20claim%20they%20have,a%20pretext%20for%20an%20invasion.&amp;text=US%20officials%20said%20the%20video,a%20way%20of%20implicating%20Nato.">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/feb/03/ukraine-russia-fake-attack-video-us-claims#:~:text=US%20officials%20claim%20they%20have,a%20pretext%20for%20an%20invasion.&amp;text=US%20officials%20said%20the%20video,a%20way%20of%20implicating%20Nato.</a><br /><br />2) about February 4th satellite images of Russian missile systems in Belarus:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reuters.com/world/satellite-images-show-troop-deployment-belarus-border-with-ukraine-ahead-russian-2022-02-06/">https://www.reuters.com/world/satellite-images-show-troop-deployment-belarus-border-with-ukraine-ahead-russian-2022-02-06/</a><br />%20Nato.<br /><br />Watch about Belarus building roads through marshes to Ukraine:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUK50HQ13Co">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUK50HQ13Co</a>{% endraw %}
