{% raw %}Making solo project videos isn’t something I like to do a lot. But with the state of the channel right now, they might be making a comeback of some sort. <br /><br />In this Short Review, I took a look at the Harry Potter movie series and expressed some thoughts, reactions, and my overall opinion on it. <br /><br />If you liked this short review and want to see more in the future, make sure to drop a like and I’m always open to feedback in the comments.<br /><br />Thanks for Watching!<br /><br />Disclaimer: I do NOT own any movie clips used in this video{% endraw %}
