{% raw %}What you should do and what it means when she is not as responsive and in to you as before.<br /><br />In this video coaching newsletter I discuss two different emails from two different viewers. The first email is from a viewer who has been cherry picking from my videos for a while, but only recently started reading my book. After a couple of great dates and sex, she seems to be becoming distant. He wonders why. The second email is from a viewer who has been watching my videos and reading 3% Man, for years. He recently got ghosted by a woman who seemed to be really interested in him. He asks what happened.<br /><br />“Women are like cats. They tend to be fickle and when they get bored they tend to disappear and roam the neighborhood. The more time they spend with you and the more comfortable they feel when they have your romantic interest when you first start dating, the more you will notice they occasionally seem to be less interested or even bored. Never take it personally, it soon will change, just like the weather constantly changes. Weak men get perturbed and butt-hurt. Strong men are unperturbed and amused, because they know she’ll be back, and if not, better will come.” ~ Coach Corey Wayne<br /><br />Click the link below to read the article “Why Is She Not As Responsive To Me As Before?” on my website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://understandingrelationships.com/why-is-she-not-as-responsive-to-me-as-before/72218">https://understandingrelationships.com/why-is-she-not-as-responsive-to-me-as-before/72218</a><br /><br />If you have not read my book, “How To Be A 3% Man” yet, that would be a good starting place for you.
