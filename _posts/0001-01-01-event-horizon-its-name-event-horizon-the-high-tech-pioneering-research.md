{% raw %}Its name: EVENT HORIZON.  The high-tech, pioneering research spacecraft mysteriously vanished, without a trace, on its maiden voyage seven years earlier.  But a weak, persistent signal form the long-missing craft prompts a rescue team, headed by the intrepid Captain Miller (Laurence Fishburne, THE MATRIX and MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE III), to wing its way through the galaxy on a bold rescue mission.  Accompanying Miller is his elite crew and the lost ship's designer (Sam Neill, JURASSIC PARK), their mission is to find and salvage the state-of-the-art interstellar horror. Kathleen Quinlan (APOLLO 13) and Joely Richardson (TVï¾’s NIP/TUCK) also star in this gripping sci-fi thriller.{% endraw %}
