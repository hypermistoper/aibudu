{% raw %}In this video there are 4 methods explained by Sadhguru. By which it will become much easier to follow brahmacharya.<br />s*men retention Will be easy .<br /><br />Sadhguru: ‚ÄúBrahman‚Äù means ‚Äúthe divine‚Äù or ‚Äúultimate,‚Äù ‚Äúcharya‚Äù means ‚Äúthe path.‚Äù If you are on the path of the divine, you are a brahmachari. To be on the path of the divine means you have no personal agendas of your own. You simply do what is needed. You have no personal ways of deciding where you should go in your life, what you should do, or what you like and dislike; all these things are simply taken away from you. If you do this unwillingly, it can be an absolute torture. If you do it willingly, it makes your life so wonderful and beautiful because there is nothing to bother you anymore. You simply do what is needed; life is so simple. Once you have given yourself like that, you do not have to bother about the spiritual path or worry about your spirituality. It is taken care of. You do not have to really do anything about it.<br /><br />People may think a brahmachari is making a great sacrifice and is being denied life. But it is not so at all. If someone is a brahmachari only by dress, yes it is true, life is torture. But for a person who is truly walking the path of the divine, the petty pleasures that the world offers will become totally meaningless. Once you enjoy the inner pleasures of your being, the external pleasures become totally meaningless.<br /><br />üìå Ride with MYSTIC has the authorization of the owner to sadhguru content in any distribution or channels ‚Äì offline and online ‚Äì and monetize them as well.<br /><br /> We have used Sadhguru's content in our video with his kind permission.
