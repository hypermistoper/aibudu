{% raw %}Cucamonga Peak is a classic southern California hike, but in the winter months the trail transforms into a challenging mountaineering route. Fierce wind, steep icy drop-offs and an even steeper climb to the summit make this a winter mountaineering adventure worthy of more than a couple celebratory summit snacks. <br /><br />DISCLAIMER: The hike to Cucamonga Peak in winter is drastically different than the summer climb. We do not recommend attempting this route without proper mountaineering experience, safety gear, and experience with route-finding. As always, hike at your own risk.<br /><br />#mountaineering #winterhiking #hiking{% endraw %}
