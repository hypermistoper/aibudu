Disarming chord progressions, a gradual sense of release and hope and a spoken word sample that will bring many to tears, 'Safe' is one of Monkey Safari's most thoughtful and well-executed tracks to date.<br /><br />'Just a few months ago, when our lives had not been upside-down yet, we produced 'Safe' as a message of unity, hope, and love. Just a normal day in the studio. But now, in these days of social isolation, it seems 'Safe' represents exactly our feelings when we look at the empty world outside. Sharing emotions is one of our main motivations when producing music and DJing. Getting together, dancing together, smiling together. 'Safe' is full of emotions that we would love to share with everyone.' Monkey Safari.<br /><br />Sharing is caring: 'Safe' has been subject to so many ID requests since Joris Voorn first started playing it, they've pushed the release forward for us all to enjoy. Stay safe everyone, brighter days will return eventually.{% endraw %}
