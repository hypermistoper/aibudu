{% raw %}We could always find our way there<br />To the beginning...<br /><br /><br />Until you’re right here, hold this song close to your chest by Tim McNary<br />Say that you will not rest.<br /><br /><br /><br />Lyrics:<br />Hold me close to your chest<br />Say that you will not rest <br />Until you’re right here, till you are right here <br /><br />Say that you’ll never leave <br />That you’ll be caring for me<br />Like in the beginning, When we were winning<br /><br />And the summer sun was coming up <br />And the nights were never long enough <br />In the beginning ahhhh<br /><br />No far away place was too far<br />We could always find our way there<br />In the beginning, in the beginning <br /><br />Now the days are short, nights are long<br />But we could still press re-start<br />Back to the beginning, when we were winning<br /><br />And the summer sun was, coming up <br />And the nights were never long enough <br />In the beginning aaahhhh<br /> <br />Could we retrace our steps<br />Perhaps, wind back our minds<br />And try to remember, being two of a kind<br />Maybe we were just kids, but we were doing things right<br />Can you remember, what it felt like<br />In the Beginning aaahhh<br /><br />Hold me close to your chest, say that you will not rest<br />Until you’re right here, till you are right here<br /><br /><br />Music:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.timmcnary.com/">http://www.timmcnary.com/</a><br /><br />Support:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1mu2MMauRuWXh1v8ztD7rD">https://open.spotify.com/album/1mu2MMauRuWXh1v8ztD7rD</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/timmcnary">https://soundcloud.com/timmcnary</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.songkick.com/artists/2937376-tim-mcnary">https://www.songkick.com/artists/2937376-tim-mcnary</a><br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Timmcnarymusic/">https://www.facebook.com/Timmcnarymusic/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mcnarymusic/">https://www.instagram.com/mcnarymusic/</a>{% endraw %}
