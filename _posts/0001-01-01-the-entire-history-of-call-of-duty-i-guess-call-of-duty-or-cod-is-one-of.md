{% raw %}Call Of Duty, or COD is one of the most amazing franchises in Video Games, spanning nearly 2 decades they've changed the gaming industry, and become a staple of it. This video was very much inspired by other videos like The Evolution of Call of Duty Games , History of Call of Duty by Nick930, and I played Every Call of Duty in a single video by Im Suda but to put a sillier spin more video essay focused spin on the concept. Focusing less on detail and more on creating a narrative. I also wanted to input my own opinion, and so I drew heavy inspiration from one of my favorite creators The Act Man with his various videos analyzing the Call of Duty games but from a broader perspective to see how we went from Modern Warfare 2 and Black Ops 2 Being so Awesome to  COD WWII and Infinite Warfare being so bad. <br /><br /><br />Patreon: <br />►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/PaprikaDota">https://www.patreon.com/PaprikaDota</a><br />Twitch: <br />► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/paprika_Spicelord">https://www.twitch.tv/paprika_Spicelord</a><br />Twitter <br />►<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Paprika_Gaming">https://twitter.com/Paprika_Gaming</a><br />Discord <br />► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/XsCYqnM">https://discord.gg/XsCYqnM</a> <br /><br />I hope you enjoy, if you do consider subscribing, and if you agree with me about COD Ghosts, Advanced Warfare, Black Ops 3, COD 4, Infinite Warfare, COD 1, COD 2, COD 3, COD Modern Warfare, and of course How Did American Youth Survive the Great Recession with Call of Duty?{% endraw %}
