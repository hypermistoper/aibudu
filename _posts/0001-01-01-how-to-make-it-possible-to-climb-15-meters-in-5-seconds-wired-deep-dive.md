{% raw %}Wired's video was a great video for the climbing community and it really did a great job on talking about speed climbing.  However since that video new techniques and innovations have surfaced in the speed climbing community and has given us tools to potentially get the elusive 5 second flat time that Wired thought was Almost Impossible.  I talked to John Brosler USA's fastest speed climber and did a deep dive on what it would take to make climbing 15 meters in 5 seconds flat possible.<br /><br />John Brosler's Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/johnbrosler/?hl=en">https://www.instagram.com/johnbrosler/?hl=en</a><br /><br />If you want to support me on patreon you can find me at:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/professorok">https://www.patreon.com/professorok</a><br /><br />My instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/professorok/">https://www.instagram.com/professorok/</a><br />If you're interested in online coaching DM me!<br /><br />Like, Comment, and Subscribe and let me know what other topics or moments in climbing you want to see next!{% endraw %}
