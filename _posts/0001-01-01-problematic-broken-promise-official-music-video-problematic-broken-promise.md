I don’t really know<br />I am lost no direction someone tell me where to go<br />Tank is running empty losing all my strength <br />Pray to God for forgiveness<br />I’m repenting on my sins <br />I regret the things I’ve done <br />Kinda hate what I’ve become<br />Cause I broke another promise to myself <br />(Mmmm) A broken promise to myself<br /><br />Verse 2:<br /><br />What’s it gonna take for the day where I finally see my worth?<br />Why do I push everyone away from me to the point they just don’t deserve?!<br />Addictive personality can’t fight this urge<br />Might wake up blessed then by night I’m cursed <br />It’s about d*mn time that I put me first<br />Don’t ignore them signs and avoid that hurt<br />Sounds a little bit insane don’t you think so?<br />These voices convoluted I’m a skitzo<br />Got a pure cold heart from my Ex <br />This life is a test<br />Doctor told me chill out take a Benzo <br />Stressing on the daily is my job to deliver <br />Detrimental to your health like a worn out liver <br />I love my fans but I hate my figure <br />Might fall down a lot but I ain’t no quitter <br /><br />Chorus Repeat <br /><br />Bridge:<br /><br />Hood up like the Grim Reap <br />Don’t disturb when I’m in my zone<br />(Shh!) Don’t speak<br />I’ll expose like a song leak <br />If anybody f**k around <br />They’ll pay a toll like a bridge fee<br />I appreciate the honest critics <br />But if you on that fake love and not real we’re finished!<br />Let myself down once again<br />Promise after promise but I won’t give in <br /><br />Chorus Repeat{% endraw %}
