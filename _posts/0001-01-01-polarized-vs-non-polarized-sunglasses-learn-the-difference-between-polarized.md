However, if you are a pilot or look at a digital screen outside, then the polarized lens may not be the best for you. <br /><br />How to do a polarized sunglasses test:<br />Hold a pair of sunglasses in front of a computer screen, rotate the sunglasses while looking through the lenses and if the image of the computer screen goes black, the sunglasses are polarized. <br /><br />You can also rotate one pair of polarized sunglasses against another pair of polarized lenses, if they go dark, then the lenses are polarized. If they do not, then at least one pair are non polarized sunglasses.<br /><br />âœ… Recommended playlists:<br />Buying New Eyeglasses?
