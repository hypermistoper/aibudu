The fun detail about our story is that the boat we bought was sinking and relying on many bilge pumps to survive so we had to lift it onto the dry to start a full refit. Once the boat was lifted (for the first time in her life) we realized that the works needed were a lot more than expected. Between bailing or accepting the challenge, we decided to go for the second option. Watch us as we bring Yabá back to life with the help of an amazing team of traditional shipwrights, sharing every phase of the process, overcoming the highs and lows and having fun along the way. <br /><br />More about us: <br />👉 About us + Q&amp;A <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/TldDlohjwTs">https://youtu.be/TldDlohjwTs</a> <br />👉 our website with more info about the project <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.sailingyaba.com">http://www.sailingyaba.com</a><br /><br />We can use songs we really enjoy listening to thanks to Artlist's high-quality music selection!
