{% raw %}If the Starseed concept is still weird to you, then you might not know if you're actually a Starseed. A Starseed is an old soul who possesses deep spiritual wisdom. That wisdom is an accumulation of their past life, and it's been lying dormant inside them all the time, not something they acquired in their current life journey. And what sounds weird is that Starseeds arrived from other solar systems or star constellations. This concept sounded bizarre, but it's been around for a while, and as far as we know, nothing is impossible in this world; we just don't know the fact yet.<br /><br />------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />❤️ Hi, guys!?
