Miraculously he is right. Since returning to his own body is not an option, a heavenly agent places him into the corpse of a rich Manhattan mogul who has just been murdered by his wife -- until a more suitable replacement can be found. Ironically, it is as this new person that Lance ultimately discovers his true self, falls in love and improves his comedy act in the process.<br /><br />CREDITS:<br />TM &amp; © Paramount Pictures (2001)<br />Cast: Chris Rock, Regina King<br />Director: Chris Weitz, Paul Weitz<br /><br />Watch More:<br />► Fresh New Clips: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2taDWqW">http://bit.ly/2taDWqW</a><br />► Classic Trailers: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2qTCxHF">http://bit.ly/2qTCxHF</a><br />► Hot New Trailers: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2qThrsF">http://bit.ly/2qThrsF</a><br />► Clips From Movies Coming Soon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2FrP8VL">http://bit.ly/2FrP8VL</a><br />► Indie Movie Clips: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2qTZMRE">http://bit.ly/2qTZMRE</a><br />► Deleted Scenes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2ARbLPJ">http://bit.ly/2ARbLPJ</a><br />► Bloopers: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2qYmBnc">http://bit.ly/2qYmBnc</a><br />► Celebrity Interviews: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2D4tzw4">http://bit.ly/2D4tzw4</a><br /><br />Fuel Your Movie Obsession: <br />► Subscribe to MOVIECLIPS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2CZa490">http://bit.ly/2CZa490</a><br />► Watch Movieclips ORIGINALS: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2D3sipV">http://bit.ly/2D3sipV</a><br />► Like us on FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2DikvkY">http://bit.ly/2DikvkY</a><br />► Follow us on TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2mgkaHb">http://bit.ly/2mgkaHb</a><br />► Follow us on INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2mg0VNU">http://bit.ly/2mg0VNU</a><br /><br />The MOVIECLIPS channel is the largest collection of licensed movie clips on the web.
