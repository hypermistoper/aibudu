Who doesn’t?<br /><br />But if you’re in sales, you’re in a particularly great position to grow your wealth—if you play your cards right, that is. More on that in a few minutes.<br /><br />In this post, I’m revealing the 3 best habits of rich people. Habits that you can learn for yourself. And habits that will put you well on your way to true financial freedom.<br /><br />One of the hardest pills to swallow about success is that it isn’t quick. Striking it rich betting on the newest cryptocurrency? Winning the lotto? These cases are rare. And the majority of the wealthy built their fortunes over time. Lots of time.<br /><br />The difference between those who become rich and those who don’t is how they spend that time. Because in reality, that’s the only thing anyone has real control over.<br /><br />Now, we’d like to think we’re in control of what we do each day. And think about it—don’t you feel that way? Like you’re in the driver’s seat?<br /><br />But in fact, we’re actually slaves to one thing that rules us all… our habits.<br /><br />Our habits control how we spend our days. They dictate our feelings. Our motivations. Our productivity. Do we work towards building a brighter future? Or do we put off tasks and give in to that warm call of the couch instead?<br /><br />Over time, these daily accomplishments (controlled by our habits) build on each other to determine our future.<br /><br />Indy 500 and Formula 1 Legend Derek Daly said it best when he told me, “You will not decide your future. You'll decide your habits. And your habits will then in turn, decide your future. Are your habits aligned with your own personal goals or stretch goals?”<br /><br />But there’s a problem here. We tend to forget what we’ve done in the past. So we end up not tying that past effort to the present, to what we’re achieving today.<br /><br />--<br /><br />👇 JOIN SELLING MADE SIMPLE ACADEMY 👇<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://salesman.org/academy">https://salesman.org/academy</a><br /><br />👇 SUBSCRIBE TO SALESMAN.ORG NOW 👇<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5m7amy0FXEAe9WxhXTI_A?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCL5m7amy0FXEAe9WxhXTI_A?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />👇 FOLLOW ON SOCIAL MEDIA FOR MORE SALES TIPS 👇<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/salesmanpodcast">https://facebook.com/salesmanpodcast</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/salesmanpodcast/">https://instagram.com/salesmanpodcast/</a>{% endraw %}
