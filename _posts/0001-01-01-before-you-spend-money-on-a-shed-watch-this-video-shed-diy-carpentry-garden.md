{% raw %}#shed #DIY #carpentry #garden #storage<br />In this video, I build the Heartland Stratford 12 foot by 8 foot shed, purchased from Lowes on sale. This video covers some of the process and challenges I encountered when building a modified floor design with a prefab kit. The other challenges included dealing with poor quality structural lumber that was warped, twisted or bowed. The take away for the manufacturer would be to supply a better framing structure and wall studs made from thick plywood as opposed to 2 X 3s. In the end I made it all work but it didn’t really save me any time versus building from scratch. The kit did come with all the hardware and the OSB boards for the roof. The roofing itself was made up of Ondura corrugated roofing panels.<br /><br /><br />HOW TO INSTALL ONDURA ROOFING: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrvqTot6hwQ&amp;t=419s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jrvqTot6hwQ&amp;t=419s</a><br /><br />DONATE TO THIS CHANNEL TO HELP KEEP IT GOING: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/2Waya68">https://bit.ly/2Waya68</a><br /><br />Donate via Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/sorensen">https://www.patreon.com/sorensen</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: My videos are for entertainment purposes only.
