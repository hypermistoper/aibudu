{% raw %}Today we are talking about a business structure which we find very interesting! The OpCo/PropCo business structure! This business structure involves separating your business into two different companies. The &quot;OpCo&quot; or operating company, handles the operational portion of the business and the &quot;PropCo&quot;, or property company, handles the development and acquisition of the real estate assets. There are numerous benefits to this type of business structure and it is used by many hospitality businesses for various reasons. As usual, discuss the particulars of your business with professionals to truly understand the details and how they relate to you to see if it's a good option for your specific business!{% endraw %}
