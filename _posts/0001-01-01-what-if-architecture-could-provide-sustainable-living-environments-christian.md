{% raw %}As senior architect in the internationally operating LAVA office (Laboratory for Visionary Architecture), Christian Tschersich deals with buildings as complex systems. His work as a lecturer focuses on generic parametric design. His talk is about how a more comprehensive understanding of the main factors of our (built) environments can lead to high-performing architecture that meets future demands. Drawing on examples, he demonstrates which innovative projects are – and could be – possible.<br /><br />This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
