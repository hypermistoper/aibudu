{% raw %}The Leadership Development Program and Wellness and Testing Center of Ateneo de Davao University Senior High School in collaboration with the Ignatian Spirituality and Formation Office - Ateneo de Davao University bring you ACCEPTANCE AND INCLUSIVITY: An Online Conversation on Gender Appreciation.<br /><br /><br /><br />As one of the modules of Leadership Development Program (LDP 2), it is very important for the Sui Generis leaders to understand the context of LGBTQ+ and those young ones who are struggling in appreciating their true identity. As Ateneans, being sensitive and compassionate to them is both our aspiration and responsibility. An aspiration that we may all live harmoniously, equally and our responsibility to make it happen.{% endraw %}
