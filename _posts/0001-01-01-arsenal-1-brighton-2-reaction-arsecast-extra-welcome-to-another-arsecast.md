{% raw %}Welcome to another Arsecast Extra, the Arsenal podcast, with myself and James from @gunnerblog.<br /><br />In this episode we discuss the 2-1 defeat to Brighton on Saturday. We start with Granit Xhaka’s selection at left-back, how it impacted the team, and what it means for Nuno Tavares. We chat about the goals we conceded, the lacklustre performance when there was supposed to be a reaction, some poor decision making, and how a late flurry wasn’t enough to prevent a truly disheartening result. There’s also stuff on Alexandre Lacazette and the need for a change up front, as well as questions about a shift in formation, keeping fringe players more involved, VAR, our top four chances and Mikel Arteta, great rivalries and lots more.<br /><br />Get extra bonus content and help support Arseblog by becoming an Arseblog Member on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/arseblog">https://www.patreon.com/arseblog</a> – this month every penny we earn from Patreon will be donated to Unicef to help children affected by conflict around the world.<br /><br />Remember, you can send us questions via which we’ll try and get to each week.
