{% raw %}A Capitol Rioter who was caught on video celebrating while participating in the insurrection and who declared &quot;this is war&quot; has been sentenced to a small amount of time in jail. During her sentencing hearing, she broke into tears and claimed that &quot;dark forces&quot; convinced her to invade the Capitol that day, but the judge didn't buy it and sent her off to jail for the next 45 days. Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins explains why these rioters continue to fall flat in court, thanks to their own social media posts. <br /><br />Link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rawstory.com/trump-supporter-who-declared-this-is-war-during-capitol-riot-gets-jail-sentence/">https://www.rawstory.com/trump-supporter-who-declared-this-is-war-during-capitol-riot-gets-jail-sentence/</a><br /><br />Become a member today!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join</a><br /><br />Support us by becoming a monthly patron on Patreon, and help keep progressive media alive!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire">https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire</a><br /><br />Find our merchandise at Teespring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store">https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store</a><br /><br />Spread the word!

There was dark energy forces that forced her to do what she's doing. Tears are rolling down her face. And the judge was like, yeah, I don't buy it. The judge, US district judge Reggie Walton said this. Um, I've been reading a couple books about how civil wars starts. And so much of history is repeating itself in our country. I love this country. This country has been good to me. And to see what people are trying to do to this country is just very concerning. To which the Capitol rioter responded again, tearfully, I don't glorify my actions. I got caught up on the energy and if I could go back and change things over, I definitely would've brought more peace.<br /><br />Would've brought more peace because clearly I already had some peace, but I, I would've just probably brought a little more of it, you know, to the whole situation here. Now here's the thing. Like so many other Capitol rioters and this is why I love to talk about this story because these people are so incredibly stupid. There's video of this now convicted rioter at the Capitol. And here is what this person says in the beginning. It's just the beginning. As Trump says, the best is yet to come. It was so ugly. It got ugly in there. It got really ugly. I'm literally by myself. They told me not to be on my own, to find a crowd and I'm by myself, that just shows how brave I am. If I can do this, you guys can do this. It's a civil war. We're coming. This is war. That was the video of this Capitol rioter at the Capitol riot. Look how brave I am.<br /><br />This is war. War is coming. If I can do it, you can do it. And you want to go in front of a judge knowing they have this video in evidence, tears rolling down your face saying, oh, I'm so sorry. If I could go back, I'd bring more peace. You got 45 days in jail. 45 days in jail for literally in your own words, in your own video posted on your social media, you're calling for war against the government and you get 45 days in jail. My God, what's the point of even having laws against things like this if all you get is 45 days in jail, right? Oh, you get to go sit in a jail cell and then you get out, you know, right before Easter, how lovely for you. You missed the rainy parts of Spring. This is ridiculous. 45 days. How about 45 years? Now that may seem excessive to people. But again, listen to her words.<br /><br />It's a civil war. We're coming. This is war. At the Capitol riot, literally declaring war on the government of the United States. And she cries about getting 45 days in jail. You're lucky you're not going behind bars forever. You're lucky we don't enforce the rules as they're written because as we all know, that comes with a capital punishment there. You can't just declare war against the United States and walk away, squeaky clean. But apparently this person can. So maybe this judge doesn't really love America as much as he claims to because if you did, this woman would be spending the next several years in jail, not just for her actions, but for the words she spoke and the meanings behind them when she was participating in that riot. That would be true justice. This is a frigging joke.{% endraw %}
