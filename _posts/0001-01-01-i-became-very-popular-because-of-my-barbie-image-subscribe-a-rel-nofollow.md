I’m Erica, and I had absolutely everything I could dream of: rich parents, a posh house and popularity. So, I never tried to study hard and didn't prepare for the final exams at school. Instead of cramming, I hung out with Chloe and Amanda at my favorite club. I was sure I would get good grades anyway because my dad was the biggest sponsor of the school! But that wasn’t what happened at all. The teachers bombarded me with questions, and I failed the exams. Mr. Collins even called Dad to school, but that didn't bother me. Dad always solved my problems easily, and I had no doubt that he would put Mr. Collins in his place.<br />I couldn’t have been more wrong!{% endraw %}
