{% raw %}What is LIFT Ireland?<br /><br />Learn all about LIFT Ireland, its principles and its goals. In this short five minute video, we hear from some of LIFT's esteemed Advisory Board including CoFounders David Hession, Sonya Lennon and Joanne Hession and board members including Mick Sweeney, Fardus Sultan, Suzanne Carroll, Eamonn Forbes, Ken Casey, Greg Clarke, Caterine Moroney, and John Lonergan.<br /><br />LIFT, which stands for ‘Leading Ireland’s Future Together’, was built on a desire to change the country for the better by changing the way people view leadership. It aims to do this through its eight-part, group learning process. LIFT’s programme is being rolled out nationwide via a volunteer facilitator network with a goal of reaching 10% of the population by 2028. <br /><br />www.liftireland.ie{% endraw %}
