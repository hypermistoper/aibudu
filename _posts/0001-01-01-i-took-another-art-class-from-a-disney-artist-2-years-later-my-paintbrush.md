{% raw %}My paintbrush line: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.artisticbearco.com">http://www.artisticbearco.com</a><br /><br />Today I went back 2 years later to the Epcot Festival of the Arts to take an art class from a Disney artist to learn how to draw a character, try artsy foods, and more! I had such a fun time!! The festival runs until February 21st, it's so much fun and perfect for artists of all ages and experience levels!<br /><br />You have artful photo ops where you can step inside classic paintings, culinary art, visual arts, and so much more. You can even meet and watch disney licensed artists making and selling their artwork!<br /><br />First time 2 years ago: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/FA_2xSI1S6I">https://youtu.be/FA_2xSI1S6I</a><br /><br /><br />ðŸŽ¨ Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/artofchloerose">http://www.twitter.com/artofchloerose</a><br />ðŸŽ¨ Instagram <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/artofchloerose">http://www.instagram.com/artofchloerose</a><br />ðŸŽ¨ Facebook <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/chloeroseartwork">http://www.facebook.com/chloeroseartwork</a><br />ðŸŽ¨ Business Email: mschlosey@gmail.com<br /><br />__________________________________________{% endraw %}
