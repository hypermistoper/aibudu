Fast forward to October 2020 where I made my pro debut in Spain 100lb heavier than my very first outing and continue to improve and add mass to the largest frame in the IFBB. Next stop, Mr Olympia :) #MassWithClass<br /><br />The Giant has landed and i'm here to make a huge mark ðŸ’ª #TeamGiant{% endraw %}
