{% raw %}Howzit punters! Lantern Luck is a brand new Habanero game that is now available on Lottostar. In this video I take my first look at the game, and I must say that it was pretty enjoyable. There are lots of little bonuses and features that trigger during the game, making for an exciting experience. My only complaint is that the spins settle a little too fast for my liking.<br /><br />Hopefully we can see Lantern Luck come to Hollywoodbets and Supabets soon.<br /><br />Apologies for the poor mic sound, I'm away and using a temporary mic :)<br /> <br />Let me know what your thoughts on Lantern Luck are in the comments below!{% endraw %}
