It's a killer progression, you've heard it in songs like Runaway by Del Shannon and Sultans of Swing by Dire Straits, as well as a million other songs. <br />This time, we're transforming into many different styles, and along the way, hopefully you pick up some composing tricks, music theory hacks, or general song writing inspiration. <br />These are the links I reference in this video. If you were confused something in this video, chances are it is explained in one of the following vids. <br />12tone- Andalusian Cadence: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/MSjVTZ_l9XA">https://youtu.be/MSjVTZ_l9XA</a><br />David Bruce- The mystery at the Heart of Flamenco <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/XYgTkW4WK80">https://youtu.be/XYgTkW4WK80</a><br />David Bruce- Composing A Melody over a Chord Progression <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/jA7gdz56LtY">https://youtu.be/jA7gdz56LtY</a><br />Writing Progressions in Minor Keys  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/j-j4g0ktPGw">https://youtu.be/j-j4g0ktPGw</a><br />Harmonic Minor Series  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTR7Cy9Sv2845ykqmNpmeGFq_v9yKZ_3A">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTR7Cy9Sv2845ykqmNpmeGFq_v9yKZ_3A</a><br />Suspended Chords <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/qu49nYaBfdM">https://youtu.be/qu49nYaBfdM</a><br />Powerchords <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/dbhF2wnnT7M">https://youtu.be/dbhF2wnnT7M</a><br />Pedal Tones + Drones <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/5E4Nsa6RL9I">https://youtu.be/5E4Nsa6RL9I</a><br /><br />A quick note- there's some sloppy guitar playing in here. I absolutely have the production skills to elminate those mistakes (and probably would if these songs were to be released on an album) but I think it's important for you all to see/hear those mistakes!<br /><br />Also the intro has many inversions and chord modifcations. I simplified the numerals. One more thing I want to point out- the Em scale over B can sound fine if you play it fast enough - pretty much anything is passable if you play it quickly. But you really can't build real harmonies off that V chord if you're using the b7 tone, and the more time your ear has to hear the dissonance, the worse it will sound!<br /><br />I use Ableton Live 10 and Reason 10 (via rewire) together to produce. <br /><br />A giant thank you to my Patreon supporters. They're the reason I'm able to offer a professional rhythm course at a name-your-own-price model.
