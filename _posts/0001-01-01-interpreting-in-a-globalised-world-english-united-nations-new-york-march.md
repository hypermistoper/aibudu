{% raw %}United Nations, New York, March 2012 - This short video describes the work of interpreters at the United Nations and the European Parliament, highlighting common features of multilingualism, while shedding light on the challenge facing both organizations - that of a shortage of qualified and skilled interpreters. The movie was shot in 2011, when Mr. Miguel Angel Martinez Martinez, Vice President of the European Union Parliament, visited United Nations Headquarters in New York.  Mr. Martinez was received by the Under-Secretary-General for General Assembly and Conference Management, Mr. Shaaban M. Shaaban.  During the visit, Mr. Martinez met briefly with Mr. Nassir Abdulaziz Al-Nasser, President of the 66th session of the General Assembly, and was given a tour of the General Assembly hall and the Department's Interpretation Service. <br /><br />[Video Co-produced by the European Union Parliament Directorate General for Interpretation and Conferences and the United Nations Department for General Assembly and Conference Management]{% endraw %}
