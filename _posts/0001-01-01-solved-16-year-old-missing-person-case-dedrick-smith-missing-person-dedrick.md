These debilitating symptoms blur the line between what is real and what isn't, making it difficult for the person to lead a typical life.<br /><br />We believe that Dedrick's schizophrenia is what led him to accidentally drive his car into Winston Lake 16-years earlier. <br /><br />Our thoughts and prayers go out to Dedrick's family during this difficult time.<br /><br />Hug the ones you love for you never know when it might be the last time you see them.<br /><br />‚ù§Ô∏è..
