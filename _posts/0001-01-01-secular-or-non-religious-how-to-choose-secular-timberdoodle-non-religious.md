{% raw %}Secular Or Non-Religious<br />I have honestly not received this question as much as you would think. Every secular homeschool group online that I have seen names Timberdoodle as &quot;not allowed.&quot; I am a proud secular homeschooler and we use Timberdoodle Non-Religious Kits. Let's break that down and see how it the Non-Religious Curriculum Kits work for Secular homeschoolers. As always, please do your own research. Please live your definition of Secular and don't go past your tolerance point. I try to share as much as I can here so that as secular homeschoolers we can all make the best decisions for our families. Please let me know if I can help by answering any questions. As always, links below.<br />#secularornonreligious #makingeverydaymagic #howtochoosesecular<br />-ðŸ’–Shanna<br />Just a mama making magic! <br /><br />Suitcase Princess: www.youtube.com/c/suitcaseprincess<br /><br />Timberdoodle Kits:<br />Timberdoodle Nonreligious 4th grade kit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://timberdoodle.com/collections/curriculum-kits/products/nonreligious-2021-fourth-grade-curriculum-kit?utm_source=making_everyday_magic&amp;utm_medium=brt&amp;utm_campaign=nonreligious-2021-fourth-grade-curriculum-kit">https://timberdoodle.com/collections/curriculum-kits/products/nonreligious-2021-fourth-grade-curriculum-kit?utm_source=making_everyday_magic&amp;utm_medium=brt&amp;utm_campaign=nonreligious-2021-fourth-grade-curriculum-kit</a><br /><br />Timberdoodle Nonreligious Kindergarten kit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://timberdoodle.com/collections/curriculum-kits/products/nonreligious-2021-kindergarten-curriculum-kit?utm_source=making_everyday_magic&amp;utm_medium=brt&amp;utm_campaign=nonreligious-2021-kindergarten-curriculum-kit">https://timberdoodle.com/collections/curriculum-kits/products/nonreligious-2021-kindergarten-curriculum-kit?utm_source=making_everyday_magic&amp;utm_medium=brt&amp;utm_campaign=nonreligious-2021-kindergarten-curriculum-kit</a><br /><br />Be sure to share the magic and subscribe for more magic<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwHXtQS5-ylYroyA8dWpANg?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwHXtQS5-ylYroyA8dWpANg?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />ðŸŽžMore Magic Vids you may like:<br />*<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwHXtQS5-ylYroyA8dWpANg/videos">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwHXtQS5-ylYroyA8dWpANg/videos</a><br /><br />ðŸŽŸSee the Rest of the Playlist Here:<br />* <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzzGqiUPPglqdQCH9w3Lyeux_YOQ95Z3P">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzzGqiUPPglqdQCH9w3Lyeux_YOQ95Z3P</a><br /><br />ðŸŽ‡More Magic<br /><br />Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://makingeverydaymagic.com/">https://makingeverydaymagic.com/</a><br />FB: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/makingeverydaymagic/">https://www.facebook.com/makingeverydaymagic/</a><br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/makingeverydaymagic/">https://www.instagram.com/makingeverydaymagic/</a><br />Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/makingeverydaymagic/">https://www.pinterest.com/makingeverydaymagic/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/EverydayShanna">https://twitter.com/EverydayShanna</a><br />Amazon Store: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/makingeverydaymagic">https://www.amazon.com/shop/makingeverydaymagic</a><br />ðŸ’Œ Contact Directly: hello@makingeverydaymagic.com<br /><br />ðŸ›’ Shop my Favorites<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/makingeverydaymagic">https://www.amazon.com/shop/makingeverydaymagic</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://makingeverydaymagic.com/favorites/">https://makingeverydaymagic.com/favorites/</a><br /><br /><br />âœ¨DISCLOSURE <br /><br />Thank you for listening to my honest opinions and using them to decide on your future purchases.
