According to the reliable source, we got the latest news that there will be no new banner after Ayaka rerun banner ends. and also Genshin Impact version 2.7 special program livestream will be released on may 20th, so it's still 20 days from now. The last event in version 2.6 is marvelous merchandise when we can get 380 Freemogems or Free Primogems but the event will end on may 13th. Highly likely we won't get any new event or new banners or compensation or Free Intertwined Fates for Yelan and Kuki Shinobu, it has been confirmed by a reliable source Uncle Y. So we have to understand that, because this is very difficult time for HOYOVERSE or miHoYo due to the current situation. I think I really need to touch some grass at that moment<br /><br />➧ Join my discord channel:<br />➝ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/3esFrE4">https://discord.gg/3esFrE4</a><br /><br />➧ Music<br />➝ Kurt - Cheel YouTube Audio Music Library<br /><br />➧ Genshin Impact social media:<br />➝ Facebook : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Genshinimpact">https://www.facebook.com/Genshinimpact</a><br />➝ Twitter : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/genshinimpact">https://twitter.com/genshinimpact</a><br />➝ YouTube : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/GenshinImpact/">https://www.youtube.com/c/GenshinImpact/</a><br />➝ Discord : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/genshinimpact">https://discord.gg/genshinimpact</a> (ALL but Chinese)<br />➝ Reddit : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/">https://www.reddit.com/r/Genshin_Impact/</a><br />➝ Instagram : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/genshinimpact/">https://www.instagram.com/genshinimpact/</a><br />➝ Website : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en">https://genshin.mihoyo.com/en</a><br />➝ Forums : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.hoyolab.com/genshin/">https://www.hoyolab.com/genshin/</a><br /><br />#GenshinImpact #원신 #原神 #ГеншинИмпакт #UndiscoveryCh #Primogem{% endraw %}
