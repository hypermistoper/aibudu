{% raw %}Sweet baby Lucinda is home! Her surgery was successful and the botfly was removed. The vet had to go deep into her skin to pull the nasty worm out and it’s highly probably damage was done to the tiny structures but will be recovered and seen as almost never been there and she is alive and that’s the most important thing!!. For the 2nd video you will see this lizard getting excited for her cricket.<br /><br />To see more of Botfly removals and more satisfying stuff, check this Instagram account out:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/hoagii">https://instagram.com/hoagii</a><br /><br />Note: All Videos Here On This Channel Have Been Allowed To Be Uploaded On It(except Commentary, it's Original And Added By Me With My Own Voice)<br /><br />Love Animals?
