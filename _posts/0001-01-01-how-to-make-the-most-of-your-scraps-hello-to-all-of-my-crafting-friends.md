{% raw %}Hello to all of my crafting friends.   Thank you so much for popping by.<br /><br />Today we are going to do something a little different.  We are going to work on using our paper and fabric scraps to create some exciting little details to add to our journals. <br /> Come and follow along with me and bring your favourite hot drink or cold drink if it is hot where you are.<br /><br />I have used my Baking Bliss Collection. I have both a digital option and a printed kit version.  Most of the kits are available in both the PDF and JPG versions, except for the Journal Pages, as it is 25 pages large.  If you are wanting to purchase these in the JPG format, just drop me an Etsy Message and I can arrange that with you.<br />The Journal Pages are also available in two sizes, namely:  US Letter size or A4.  Each kit is clearly labelled, so you don't choose the wrong one.<br /><br />I have a Coupon Code, valid for the month of January 2022.  It is BAKINGBLISS25  and it will enable you to benefit from a 25% discount if you spend over Â£14 (British Pounds or equivalent) in my Etsy store.  Just type in BAKINGBLISS25 into the Store code box on check-out.<br /><br />You are most welcome to use any kit you like.  You are not obligated in any way to purchase my kits at all.  Please use what you have in your craft room.  If you have a printer and would like some digitals, I do have freebies available in my Facebook group.  You might just want to try them.  They are free, as the name suggests.<br /><br />Here is the link for my Facebook Group Fans of Angela Kerr Designs:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/326471378943654/?ref=share">https://www.facebook.com/groups/326471378943654/?ref=share</a><br /><br />Here is the link for the playlist for this complete Baking Bliss Journal Project:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcieoffxG12QYdJdvu8lmwcc4YLqwxEY_">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcieoffxG12QYdJdvu8lmwcc4YLqwxEY_</a><br /><br />Here is my Etsy link for my NEW and current journal kits in my store:  Etsy as Angela Kerr Designs or <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://etsy.me/2RR1qhm">https://etsy.me/2RR1qhm</a><br /><br />My New Kits are called Baking Bliss and here are the links: <br /><br />Lace and Doily Digital Kit:  www.etsy.com/uk/listing/851322443<br /><br />My Pastel Butterflies: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://etsy.me/3yqZMac">https://etsy.me/3yqZMac</a><br /><br />My Fussy Cut flowers Set 2:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://etsy.me/3fLbdl3">https://etsy.me/3fLbdl3</a><br /><br />US Letter Size Baking Bliss Journal Digital Pages: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://etsy.me/3esTTRo">https://etsy.me/3esTTRo</a><br /><br />Tea, Avo and Lacey Sheets digital pages:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://etsy.me/3bWxdYb">https://etsy.me/3bWxdYb</a><br /><br />A4 Baking Bliss Journal Pages:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://etsy.me/3qxNhXQ">https://etsy.me/3qxNhXQ</a><br /><br />Baking Bliss Add On Kit:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://etsy.me/3myBwiD">https://etsy.me/3myBwiD</a><br /><br />Baking Bliss Ephemera Kit:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://etsy.me/3yZF9mw">https://etsy.me/3yZF9mw</a><br /><br />Baking Bliss Sentiments Kit:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://etsy.me/3mvnKgw">https://etsy.me/3mvnKgw</a><br /><br />Baking Bliss Printed Kits:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://etsy.me/3JvR8NN">https://etsy.me/3JvR8NN</a><br /><br />For all my favourite tools: Including all I have used in today's project can be found on my Amazon Favourites lists below.<br /><br />My Amazon Favourite Crafting tools list UK:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/shop/angelakerr">https://www.amazon.co.uk/shop/angelakerr</a><br /><br />My Amazon Favourite Crafting tools list USA:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/angelakerr">https://www.amazon.com/shop/angelakerr</a><br /><br />My Amazon Favourites Crafting Tools List Canada: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.ca/shop/angelakerr">https://www.amazon.ca/shop/angelakerr</a><br /><br />My Amazon Favourites Crafting Tools List Germany: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.de/shop/angelakerr">https://www.amazon.de/shop/angelakerr</a><br /><br />My Amazon Favourites Crafting Tools List Australia:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com.au/hz/wishlist/ls/2ZLBP8MWESUIZ?ref_=wl_share">https://www.amazon.com.au/hz/wishlist/ls/2ZLBP8MWESUIZ?ref_=wl_share</a><br /><br />These are some of my favourite tools, that I use on a regular basis while crafting.<br />As an Amazon Associate I do earn a small commission on qualifying purchases at no extra cost to you.<br /><br />You can find me on: (links on my Youtube main page!)<br />Instagram at:  Angela Kerr Designs or www.instagram.com/Angelakerrdesigns/<br />Etsy as Angela Kerr Designs or <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://etsy.me/2RR1qhm">https://etsy.me/2RR1qhm</a><br />Pinterest:  Angela K.  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://pin.it/%2BTh0V1q">https://pin.it/%2BTh0V1q</a><br />My email which is: Angelakerr2468@gmail.com<br />My Facebook Group:  Fans of Angela Kerr Designs<br /><br />Have fun crafting!! ðŸ¤—<br />Angela x<br />Thank you so much for watching{% endraw %}
