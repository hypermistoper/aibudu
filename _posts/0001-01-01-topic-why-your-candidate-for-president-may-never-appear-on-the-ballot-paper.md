{% raw %}Topic: *Why your candidate for president may never appear on the ballot paper in 2023*<br /><br /><br /><br />In the next 40 days, chiefs and delegates of various political parties in Nigeria will select the next president. There will be no debate among candidates of each party, and voters like you will not be involved in the selection process. Nigeria's ruling party, the APC, demands N100 million from interested candidates. Other parties are not far off.<br /><br /><br /><br />The voters will have no choice but to vote for whoever the party delegates and chiefs pick at the end of the day. What kind of candidates will emerge?<br /><br /><br /><br />Join us tomorrow, Saturday, April 23, 2022, at 4.00 PM Nigeria Time and 11.00 AM New York Time as we survey Nigeria's political landscape in another episode of *HaveYourSay247.* Also, we will look at the tragic death of gospel singer, Osinachi Nwachukwu, domestic violence in Nigeria, and the role of pastors in the devastating pandemic. Please make it a date!{% endraw %}
