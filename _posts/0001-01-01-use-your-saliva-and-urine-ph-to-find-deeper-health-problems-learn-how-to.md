Using pH strips can easily and inexpensively help you keep track of your pH and your overall health. <br /><br />The pH scale goes from 1 to 14. Anything over 7 is more alkaline, and anything under 7 is more acidic. Different parts of your body require different pH levels. <br /> <br />Your urine pH should be between 4.8 to 7.8. If your urine is too alkaline, it could be due to:<br /> • Drinking too much alkaline water<br /> • Testing right after eating <br /> • Consuming a vegan diet<br /> • An infection <br /> • Diuretics or antacids <br /> • Vomiting <br /><br />Urine that's too alkaline can increase your risk of:<br /> • Gout<br /> • Kidney stones <br /> • Kidney failure<br /><br />If your urine is too acidic, it could be due to:<br /> • Consuming too much meat <br /> • Uncontrolled diabetes <br /> • Diarrhea <br /> • Fasting or starvation<br /> • Dehydration<br /> • Testing the first urine catch of the day<br /><br />Your saliva pH should be between 6.2 to 7.6. If your saliva is too alkaline, it could be due to:<br /> • Too much bacteria in your mouth<br /><br />Saliva that's too alkaline can increase your risk of:<br /> • Tartar crystals (advanced dental plaque) <br /> • Gingivitis (mild gum inflammation) <br /><br />If your saliva is too acidic, it could be due to:<br /> • Consuming too much sugar <br /> • Too much bacteria in your mouth<br /><br />Saliva that's too acidic can increase your risk of:<br /> • Dental cavities <br /> • Halitosis <br /> • Periodontitis (severe gum inflammation) <br /><br />I've made a lot of different videos with more specific information on correcting your pH. But, the most important thing you can do to fix an extreme pH level is to focus on eating healthily.
