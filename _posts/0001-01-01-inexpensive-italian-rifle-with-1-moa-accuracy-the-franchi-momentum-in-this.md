{% raw %}In this episode of TFBTV, James Reeves visits the Franchi Booth of EOS (European Outdoor Show) to check out the cookbooks, club music, women - oh yeah - and the guns. Bruno walks James through the Franchi Horizon/Momentum series of bolt-action rifles, an inexpensive but well-made Italian bolt gun that still carries an MOA-accuracy guarantee. <br /><br />According to Franchi's materials on the rifle:<br />&quot;The feature-rich Momentum represents the cutting edge of hunting rifle technology and performance. Ergonomic, light and fast-handling, its accuracy-enhancing, free-floating, coldhammer-forged barrel is threaded to accept a muzzle brake or suppressor (not included). Enjoy 1-MOA accuracy with premium factory ammunition. The bolt has a short 60-degree throw for fast cycling. A TSA recoil pad reduces felt recoil up to 50 percent. the single-stage trigger adjusts 2 to 4 lbs. Momentum takes the same scope bases as the Remington model 700 (two piece bases only).&quot;{% endraw %}
