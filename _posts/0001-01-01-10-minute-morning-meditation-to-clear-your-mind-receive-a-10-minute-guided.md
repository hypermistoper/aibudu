{% raw %}A 10 Minute guided morning meditation to clear your mind &amp; receive... You know how sometimes when you're feeling blissed out in meditation, beautiful ideas come to you? Or even just thoughts that you don't think you conjured up - like they just materialized in your mind somehow? This is the receptive mode. We're in it quite often actually, but we can be receptive to the influence of emotions like fear and anxiety if we're not giving ourselves intentional time to practice honing into the feeling of receiving inspiration during peaceful moments of meditation. Trust what you sense and receive and if any inspired ideas come to you that require action, trust your heart!{% endraw %}
