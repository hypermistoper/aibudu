{% raw %}The PRECEDE PROCEED is a logic model that can help us design health promotion initiatives that involve the community we are trying to support. A key concept is that we engage with our community and figure out what THEY want given what quality of life issues are relevant to them. We then work backwords from there to figure out what predisposing, reinforcing and enabling factors are associated with the behaviours that are affecting or that could affect their quality. Once we have designed an intervention that is based on their needs and is politically, logistically, and environmentally feasible, we run the intervention and evaluate, evaluate, evaluate!{% endraw %}
