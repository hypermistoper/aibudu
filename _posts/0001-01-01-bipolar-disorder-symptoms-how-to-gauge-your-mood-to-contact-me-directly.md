Episodes can sometimes sneak up on us and get out of control before we realize it. Something I've learned over the years is how my Bipolar symptoms tend to follow very specific (and sometimes predictable) pattern. These patterns were always there but I didn't know what to look for in the past. These patterns can also be very different for each person, so it's important to learn how YOUR Bipolar symptoms manifest. I've mentioned how we all experience different triggers, symptoms, and thresholds for coping with them.<br /><br />That being said, I'd like to share a a few techniques for &quot;gauging your mood.&quot; The examples I'll provide can be used as a reference to find your very own &quot;metric&quot; for gauging your own Bipolar Symptoms. This is an incredibly valuable way to cultivate awareness and reduce the severity of our Bipolar symptoms.<br /><br />I'm very excited to hear from all of you in the comments on this video! I hope we can all work together to share techniques which work for us. The more we share, the easier it will be for others to find a &quot;metric&quot; that works well for them. Thank you so much for taking the time to watch and comment. We are in this together!<br /><br /><br />My channel is completely dedicated to helping individuals, families, and friends who struggle with, or know someone living with Bipolar Disorder. My goal is to provide actual tools, tips, and discuss topics that can potentially help “Polar Warriors” grow to live a more balanced, peaceful, and fulfilling life.<br /><br />-Rob Whittaker, Polar Warriors: Bipolar Support <br /><br /><br />HELPFUL LINKS &amp; ADDITIONAL CONTENT:<br /><br />-Check out my Partner, The International Bipolar Foundation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ibpf.org/">http://www.ibpf.org/</a> <br /><br />*FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/PolarWarriors/">https://www.facebook.com/PolarWarriors/</a> <br /><br />*BECOME A PATRON: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/PolarWarriors">https://www.patreon.com/PolarWarriors</a>{% endraw %}
