{% raw %}The body fat scale I use is under $30 and works great. You can find it here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2FdlFn6">https://amzn.to/2FdlFn6</a><br /><br />For a higher end scale, I have liked this Withings Body+ Scale: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Gz241i">https://amzn.to/2Gz241i</a><br /><br />Please note that as an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases made through the amazon links above.<br /><br />The important metric when losing weight is to try and pay attention to the amount of body fat you are losing. The problem is that accurate body fat measurements require DXA or hydrostatic testing. You can even utilize calipers or tape measurements, but who has time for that? In this video, I cover the science behind how the bioeletrical impedance analysis scales work to measure body fat, why they're inaccurate, and the best practices for using them to the best of their ability. <br /><br />If you like the video, please consider subscribing!<br /><br />#weightloss #fatloss #fitness{% endraw %}
