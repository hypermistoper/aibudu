{% raw %}John MacArthur claims in his video (see below) that the gifts of the Spirit have ceased, at the sealing of the canon of Scripture— in this video I show this popular church doctrine to be utterly false. It (seems) its only purpose is to have your Pastor or religious leader control you, and not the Holy Spirit.<br /><br /><br />➤Definition: Cessationism is the Protestant doctrine that spiritual gifts such as speaking in tongues, prophecy and healing ceased with the Apostolic Age. Reformers such as John Calvin originated this view. More recent development has tended to focus on other spiritual gifts too, owing to the advent of Pentecostalism and the Charismatic movement that have popularised a radical continuationism – the position that the spiritual gifts are meant for all Christians in every age.
