Do you know what a red panda is?? If you don’t, that’s probably because it’s estimated that fewer than 2,500 are left in the wild. On top of that, they live in dense bamboo forests at high-altitudes making them even harder to spot. Which is ideal to keep them away from poachers, but not great for those who want to save them such as the guardians of the Red Panda Network who walk the forests of the Nepalese Himalayas, to track and count them. <br /><br />This documentary follows the only female member of the Red Panda Network as she and the team hope to find a hint to the species survival. This is Firefox Guardian from wildlife filmmaker Gunjan Menon.<br /><br />#conservation #redpandas #endangeredspecies #documentary #seekerindie #seeker #nature<br />____________________<br /><br />Seeker empowers the curious to understand the science shaping our world.
