{% raw %}This is evidenced by a new telephone conversation between occupiers intercepted by the SSU.<br />‘The brigade commander comes and says: ‘Are you f**king kidding me? You can’t you take a small village for two days now?’ ‘Well, there are civilians…’ our guys say. ‘No one gives a f**k!’ Roll back 1.5 kilometers and a volley from all guns! And that’s f**king it,’ and so we just razed it to the ground… Ukrops [Ukrainian military] and civilians, everyone,’ an invader in Donbas tells his wife.<br />The SSU is documenting ruscists’ atrocities: since the full-scale invasion started, we have opened over 10,000 cases. We are working to punish everyone involved in russia’s aggression!{% endraw %}
