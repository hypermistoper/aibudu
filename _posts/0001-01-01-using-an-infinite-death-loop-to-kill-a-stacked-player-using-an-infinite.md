I escaped a prison and then got my revenge on the entire minecraft server smp. This video is similar to Parrot / Parrotx2 and his school's minecraft server and school smp series where he ended or started a war. This is like the LifeSteal SMP, a minecraft server not like the Awaken SMP or the Dream SMP or the OneTrySMP or a lifesteal smp copy. This is the hardest minecraft server ever. This is how I ended an entire minecraft server. This is similar to Parrot, Tommyinnit Lifesteal, Quiff, Doni Bobes, and Minecraft Curios. This is like one block but a minecraft smp. This is on minecraft 1.18. I take revenge on the deadliest minecraft smp<br /><br />#Minecraft #LifeSteal #MinecraftSMP{% endraw %}
