{% raw %}The hot and humid season is already here. This unbearable heat will grow more intense during the months of April and May. Because of the summer weather most of the trees are ready and heavy with various fruits. Some flowers need hot scorching sun to be in full bloom. One of those flowers is Hibiscus. Hibiscus flower needs very hot sun to be in full bloom. It is a special flower which blooms at dawn and withers and falls off during the sunset. Some people call the hibiscus flower as the “Shoe Flower”(Sapaththu mala) but the reason is unknown. Hibiscus flower is very common in our country and have many varieties and colors too. <br /><br />Almost every house in the adjacent village, have grown hibiscus trees in line on their fences. When the flowers blooms on those trees, the red hibiscus flowers gives an amazing sight to everyone. I used to pick hand full of flowers when I passed through that way and used to make hibiscus tea. Actually hibiscus tea has a very medicinal and nutritional properties. Yesterday I went that way, mainly to pick hibiscus flowers as the red colour of the petals can be used to make purple mixed red colored desserts and other dishes. This extraordinary medicinally valued flower gives a very beautiful color close to magenta when poured hot water in them! That colour can be used to color different varieties of desserts , sweets and fruit smoothies as the color can be used as a natural food colouring. What I do is that I dries petals of the flowers so they can be kept for longtime and use.<br /><br />The most phenomenal thing happened when I added the hibiscus flowers into the sugar mixed water as the water changed into a beautiful red color. Then when I added the deskinned pears to the boiling sugar syrup, amazingly the pears also became beautiful and red in color. I made the pudding with freshest cows milk together with Chins moss(agar agar) and condensed milk. Once it set I decorated the pudding by placing the pear cubes around it with syrup and added pears slices to make it more appetising! As always our brother was more eager to taste it than enjoying that eye-pleasing dessert. <br /><br />I made some sweet snack on the next day for the evening tea. I hurried to our elder Aunty's place to fetch our Grandmother with some of the sweets for them too, because she went to visit our Elder aunty earlier that day. I got a sweet surprise when I came back with Grandmother as my Brother had already made tea for us. How nice of my little brother. He had made an unusual milk tea with some of my dried hibiscus petals, adding an attractive pink colour with a very fresh taste as well. I wondered silently with a very pleasing mind of this awesome match made in heaven, with hibiscus colored sugar dusted snack(Seeni Bello) and brothers pink hibiscus flower milk tea. I couldn't help smiling to myself to hear Grandmothers long and non stop praising of our brothers pink tea until the day ended.<br /><br />Love you All!<br />Nadee<br /><br />© All rights reserved<br />Hibiscus flowers!
