{% raw %}Cecilia's Update Video 3 Years Later: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/6wXCEAXfYco">https://youtu.be/6wXCEAXfYco</a><br /><br />Cecilia is diagnosed with schizophrenia and experiences frequent hallucinations of a violent clown. Afraid others would think she was crazy, Cecilia silently struggled through her symptoms until a failed suicide attempt brought her to a mental ward. <br /><br />Today Cecilia is dedicated to ensuring nobody in the world is ever again afraid to say “I have schizophrenia.” <br /><br />Support SBSK on Twitter at <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/chrisSBSK.">https://twitter.com/chrisSBSK.</a>{% endraw %}
