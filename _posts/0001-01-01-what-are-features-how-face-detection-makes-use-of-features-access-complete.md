The approach we’ll take is to train our AI using an existing dataset of faces created by the University of Yale, and then give it our own faces to see if it can recognize them.<br /><br />The big topics that will be covered in this course center around the concept of Dimensionality Reduction. We’ll cover techniques such as Eigenfaces and Fisherfaces to make our AI detect faces. This will be complemented by a more accurate technique named Local Binary Patterns. We’ll cover the Yale Faces Database and how you can add additional faces to it.{% endraw %}
