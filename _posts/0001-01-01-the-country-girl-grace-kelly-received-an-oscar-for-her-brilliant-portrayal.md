{% raw %}Grace Kelly received an Oscar for her brilliant portrayal of the wife, and Bing Crosby gave one of the most outstanding performances of his varied career as an alcoholic, guilt-ridden and has-been actor. When he is given an opportunity to star in a new musical show, his wife (Grace Kelly) and the show's director (William Holden) attempt to bolster his ego and help him make a comeback. This superb and timeless drama, based on Clifford Odets' play, was nominated for seven Academy Awards.{% endraw %}
