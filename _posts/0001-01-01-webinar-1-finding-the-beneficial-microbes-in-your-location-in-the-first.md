{% raw %}In the first webinar we’ll be exploring the microscopic world beneath our feet. There are billions of microorganisms in a single teaspoon of soil and they are not all beneficial to plant life. So how do we know which are desirable and which aren’t? <br /><br />We’ll be introducing you to some of these critters under the microscope and we’ll be looking at how you can find them on the land in your area, no matter where you live! <br /><br />Finally we’ll explore some of the benefits of regenerative agriculture, such as Nutrient Cycling. <br /><br />This is an information packed webinar, but don't worry if there is too much to digest, as you’ll be able to ask questions in the Q&amp;A session and you’ll be able to watch the recording after the live event.<br /><br />Our panelists will be: <br /><br />Dr. Elaine Ingham, Soil Food Web School Founder<br /><br />Eric Feiler, Soil Food Web Consultant<br /><br />Brian Vagg of Sprouting Soil, Soil Food Web Consultant<br /><br />Dr. Adrienne Godschalx, Soil Food Web School Mentor<br /><br />Dr. Adam Cobb, Soil Food Web School Science Communicator{% endraw %}
