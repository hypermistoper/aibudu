{% raw %}An analogy is a comparison between things that have similar features, often used to help explain a principle or idea:<br /><br />For example, here is a quote from psychiatrist Elisabeth Kubler-Ross<br /><br />People are like stained glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within.<br /><br />The analogy here is between stained glass windows and people. It is a creative comparison that illuminates a point--it is easy for a person to be good and jolly when things are going well, and not so easy to share these same sentiments when problems occur. <br /><br />Now you may think: Hmm, this sounds like a metaphor. And you would be partly correct--metaphors can be used in analogies. However, what sets an analogy apart from a metaphor is that an analogy seeks to explain something, while a metaphor does not.<br /><br />Here is another example of an analogy by humorist P.G. Woodehouse:<br /><br />‚ÄúIt has been well said that an author who expects results from a first novel is in a position similar to that of a man who drops a rose petal down the Grand Canyon of Arizona and listens for the echo.‚Äù<br />The analogy here is between an author‚Äôs expectation from a first novel, and dropping a rose petal into the grand canyon while expecting an echo.<br /><br />It is an outrageous analogy--and that is the point. Woodehouse is demonstrating that a writer‚Äôs expectation for his/her first novel should be grounded in reality. You wouldn‚Äôt expect to hear the echo of a rose petal dropped into a canyon would you? Of course not. So you should have realistic expectations for writing a first novel as well.<br /><br />Now it is your turn to identify the analogy in the following three examples. Besides identifying what two things are being compared, be ready to explain the significance of the comparison. Oh, and for number four, be ready to create your own analogy. Good luck. <br /><br />1. Worrying is as effective as trying to solve an algebra equation by chewing bubble gum.<br /><br />--Baz Luhrmann<br /><br />2. If you want my final opinion on the mystery of life and all that, I can give it to you in a nutshell. The universe is like a safe to which there is a combination.<br /><br />--Peter De Vries<br /><br />3. You see, wire telegraph is a kind of a very, very long cat.  You pull his tail in New York and his head is meowing in Los Angeles.  Do you understand this? And radio operates exactly the same way: you send signals here, they receive them there.  The only difference is that there is no cat.<br /><br />--Albert Einstein<br /><br />üëâüëâüëâSupport Tolentino Teaching by buying mugs, t-shirts, notebooks and more! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/TolentinoTeaching?ref=seller-platform-mcnav">https://www.etsy.com/shop/TolentinoTeaching?ref=seller-platform-mcnav</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.redbubble.com/people/TolentinoTeach/shop?asc=u">https://www.redbubble.com/people/TolentinoTeach/shop?asc=u</a><br /><br />üîî SUBSCRIBE for more for online teaching resources: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxVn...">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCxVn...</a><br /><br />üé• WANT TO CREATE VIDEOS LIKE THESE?<br />This is the software I use:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinm...">https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinm...</a><br /><br />üë®‚Äçüíª LET'S CONNECT<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/tolentinote...">https://www.instagram.com/tolentinote...</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/tolentinotea...">https://www.facebook.com/tolentinotea...</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/TolentinoTeach">https://twitter.com/TolentinoTeach</a><br />Facebook ELA Group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/24111...">https://www.facebook.com/groups/24111...</a><br /><br />**Disclaimer: Tolentino Teaching  is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program and AWIN, affiliate advertising programs designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to www.amazon.com and <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://paidforadvertising.com/‚Äã">http://paidforadvertising.com/‚Äã</a>{% endraw %}
