{% raw %}This song is about the life of Joseph from the Bible. From his humble beginnings, sold into slavery by his brothers, his life in the house of Potiphar, in prison and beside the pharaoh of Egypt, leading the country through famine. A wonderful story that teaches character and also forgiveness. <br /><br />#BibleSongs #BibleHeroes #JosephStoryInTheBible<br /><br />David &amp; Goliat Productions - Christian childrens' songs is a musical project with the purpose of promoting the message of the Gospel and the Bible principles in a creative, inovative and modern way through Christian songs and cartoons. <br /><br />Lyrics <br /><br />Early in the morning, getting out of bed,<br />Joseph told his family `bout the dreams he had.<br />Everybody knew the heavenly reveal:<br />God will make him great and all of them will kneel. <br /><br />Be that as it may, certainly one day<br />God will make him prosper and thrive.<br /><br />All the elder brothers wickedly behaved:<br />Traded younger Joseph in Egypt as a slave,<br />Potiphar was pleased and Joseph didn`t fail,<br />But he was betrayed and ended up in jail.<br /><br />Be that as it may, certainly one day<br />God will make him prosper and thrive.<br /><br />Even in the prison Joseph served and prayed,<br />Thought about his old dreams when he was afraid,<br />God was watching over hearing his calls<br />Carrying out His plan beyond the prison walls.<br /><br />Be that as it may, certainly one day<br />God will make him prosper and thrive.<br /><br />There came the day when Pharaoh had a dream<br />Only Joseph could understand.<br />Trusted by the king and knowing what to do<br />Saved the land by God`s mighty hand.<br /><br />Thanks to godly Joseph Egypt still had food.<br />Guess who came to buy some from the neighborhood?<br />All the elder brothers taken by surprise<br />By the younger Joseph merciful and wise<br /><br />Be that as it may, certainly one day<br />God will make me prosper and thrive.{% endraw %}
