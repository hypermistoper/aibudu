{% raw %}Something just exploded on the far side of the sun. A fairly fast and impressive asymmetric halo CME was observed in NASA's SOHO LASCO C2/C3 just after 30/0600 UC. STEREO-A COR2 confirmed that this event occurred on the far side of the Sun and is not Earth directed.<br /><br />Thanks for watching! <br /><br />#CME #solareruption #spaceweather <br /><br />Music credit: YouTube Audio Library <br />Red Nose Hose - Jingle Punks{% endraw %}
