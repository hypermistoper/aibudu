{% raw %}Bit of background info, Julie is a good friend from school. We used to be close but have drifted apart and don’t see each other as much as we used to. John is her boyfriend. We used to be close but he has been cold towards me recently. They have both opened up a business and I am a lawyer at a decent sized firm. A few days ago I get a text from my good friend Julie out of the blue wanting to meet up. I was thrilled because Julie has bailed the last couple of times I have organised things. We meet up, but the whole time Julie keeps fishing for free legal advice about her business, which I politely refused. I refused for many reasons; she sought advice in an area of law I have minimal experience in, it goes against the conditions of my practicing licence, what she wanted me to do would take up most of my limited free time, and in my jurisdiction there are rules and lots of warnings against giving free legal advice to friends and family – <br /><br />#AITA #RedditUpdate <br /><br /><br />Chapters<br /><br />00:00 Intro<br />00:10 Story 1<br />12:02 My opinion <br />12:33 Story 1 comments<br /><br /><br />Reddit aita. justnomil reddit. r/aita update. reddit update. justnoso reddit. aita. reddit husband. reddit stories. justnoso reddit. reddit update. r/ relationships. r/ AITA. r/aita.  r/ Relationship_Advice. r/justnomil. rslash.<br /><br /><br />Stories<br /><br />1.
