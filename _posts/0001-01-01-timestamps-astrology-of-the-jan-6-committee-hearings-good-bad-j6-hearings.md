How will it go?<br /><br />22:00 The weirdness gets weirder. Huff Post put out article from Truth Social about CHILDRENS book starring &quot;King Donald&quot; bedeviled by &quot;Hillary Queenton&quot; and &quot;shifty knights&quot;. &quot;King Donald&quot; accused of working with &quot;Russioians&quot; by a dossier kept in a &quot;steel box&quot;. You can't make this stuff up. Do I even want to know what the book sales will be?<br />31:00  Will there be justice in Uvalde? According to San Antonio newspaper editor, Uvalde police are so desperate, they have recruited biker gangs to intimidate media to stop interviews. Aas a sidenote: I live in TX, these bikers are almost a militia unto themselves, well organized and well connected. Gilead is not far away.<br />37:15  Will Boris Johnson survive the no-confidence vote today?<br />43:30  Biden gave out so many executive orders at the beginning of his terms. Why is he reluctant to do it as a temporary fix for gun control and...<br />47:30 ...abortion rights?<br />50:30 Once the Dems can take over the Senate and House, will Biden be able to reform all the Federal Government institutions that was gutted by Trump and taken over by Trumpsters?<br />54:15 Are we going to find out the Republicans have always given out gifts like gas cards, etc.?<br /><br />57:00 â€‹Will anything be revealed in the January 6 hearings that will lead to Justice Thomas being impeached?<br /><br />1:04:30 Will the DOJ start making arrests as the Jan. 6th Committee hearings air?<br />1:08:30 Rep. Louie Gohmert (Texas- R) says Peter Navarro indictment means Republicans 'can't even lie to Congress or lie to an FBI agent or they're coming after you.' Is he for real?<br />1:15:00 Is Chuck Grassley going to be in line to be arrested or forced out?<br />. <br /><br />TODAY'S TAROT DECK â€¢ Gold Foil Tarot â€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3GSI9oS">https://amzn.to/3GSI9oS</a><br /><br />Thank you so much for watching! ðŸ–¤ðŸ§¡ <br /><br /><br />//AVAILABLE MERCH <br />â€¢ Cute Kitty Tarot pouch â€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3tueInT">https://bit.ly/3tueInT</a> <br />â€¢ Cute Kitty Tarot sticker â€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3JCmDFj">https://bit.ly/3JCmDFj</a><br /><br /><br />//TAROT CARDS used on this channel <br /><br />â€¢ Aquarian Tarot Deck (Art Nouveau/Art Deco-style)â€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2ZRVUAN">https://amzn.to/2ZRVUAN</a> <br /><br />â€¢ Gilded Tarot Royale Deckâ€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3fkHbmH">https://amzn.to/3fkHbmH</a> <br />â€¢ Gold Foil Tarot â€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3GSI9oS">https://amzn.to/3GSI9oS</a><br /><br />â€¢ Golden Art Nouveau Tarot â€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2YZL5vg">https://amzn.to/2YZL5vg</a> <br /><br />â€¢ Halloween Tarot Deckâ€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2SFQ4wN">https://amzn.to/2SFQ4wN</a> <br /><br />â€¢ Housewives Tarot Deckâ€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Zx78Hp">https://amzn.to/2Zx78Hp</a> <br /><br />â€¢ Morgan-Greer (70's-tastic) Tarot Deckâ€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3etLXgN">https://amzn.to/3etLXgN</a> <br /><br />â€¢ Smith-Waite Centennial Tarot Deck (light gray back) â€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3nFOIQC">https://amzn.to/3nFOIQC</a> <br /><br />â€¢ Rider-Waite Tarot Deck (blue plaid back)â€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Y4PpXA">https://amzn.to/2Y4PpXA</a> <br /><br />â€¢ Smith-Waite Tarot Deck Borderless (green back)â€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2DOiejq">https://amzn.to/2DOiejq</a> <br /><br />â€¢ Steampunk Tarot Deckâ€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2TIPK19">https://amzn.to/2TIPK19</a> <br /><br />â€¢ Yarn Tarot â€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3HHxhbY">https://amzn.to/3HHxhbY</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />//OTHER PRODUCTS USED <br /><br />â€¢ The long-sleeved shirts I wear are available in many colors â€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3BrLTdu">https://amzn.to/3BrLTdu</a> <br /><br />â€¢ I wear press-on nails using Short-term (a few hours) Nails Glue Adhesive Tabs/Stickers â€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2G2r0uj">https://amzn.to/2G2r0uj</a> <br /><br />â€¢ Playing Cards Holder (the card rack I'm using) â€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3yklagI">https://amzn.to/3yklagI</a> <br /><br />â€¢ Lunch during the livestream is usually Orgain Organic Vegan Protein Powder, Creamy Chocolate Fudge â€¢ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3AxLO7I">https://amzn.to/3AxLO7I</a> <br /><br /><br /><br />//IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER - PLEASE READ!
