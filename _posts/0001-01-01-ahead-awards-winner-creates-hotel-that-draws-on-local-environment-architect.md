{% raw %}Architect Jonathon Leitersdorf explains the vision behind luxury resort Six Senses Ibiza, in this video produced by Dezeen Studio for the AHEAD hospitality awards.<br /><br />The Six Senses is located in Cala Xarraca, on the northern tip of Ibiza.<br /><br />The project was named the winner of the Spa and Wellness category at the AHEAD Europe awards 2021.<br /><br />The AHEAD Awards celebrate striking hospitality projects from across the world and is split into four different regions: Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia and the Americas.<br /><br />The winners of the AHEAD Europe hospitality awards were announced during a live ceremony in London on the 19th November.<br /><br />According to Leitersdorf the hotel was designed to take cues from the local spaces on the island, in order to feel more like a real community.<br /><br />&quot;The first concept that we had in our mind was a sense of discovery,&quot; Leitersdorf told Dezeen.<br /><br />&quot;We ended up with a concept of a utopian village built out of nine buildings, which are actually all connected underground.&quot;<br /><br />&quot;The idea is, if you created something more like a village that has outdoor spaces and indoor spaces, and they're all a little different and a lot more intimate, then people will be happy to stay and never leave.&quot;<br /><br />The 20-acre site offers up to 116 guest rooms and includes restaurants, a spa &amp; wellness centre, and a yoga pavilion.<br /><br />The resort's design takes cues from the surrounding environment, with many of the structures finished in terracotta hues and an organic material palette, reflecting the rugged terrain of the site.<br /><br />Read more on: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.dezeen.com/?p=1743393">https://www.dezeen.com/?p=1743393</a><br /><br />Subscribe to our YouTube channel for the latest architecture and design movies: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1tcULvhLike​">http://bit.ly/1tcULvhLike​</a> <br /><br />Dezeen on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/dezeen/​">https://www.facebook.com/dezeen/​</a><br />Follow Dezeen on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Dezeen/​">https://twitter.com/Dezeen/​</a><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dezeen/​">https://www.instagram.com/dezeen/​</a><br />Check out our Pinterest: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://uk.pinterest.com/dezeen/">https://uk.pinterest.com/dezeen/</a>{% endraw %}
