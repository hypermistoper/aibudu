{% raw %}The ravager apocalypse is here on the Unstable SMP... a Minecraft Server that is NOT the Lifesteal SMP... I have spawned over 1000 Ravagers on this Minecraft SMP, so Here's Why I Spawned 1047 Ravagers in Survival Minecraft... and it's known as the Unstable SMP...<br /><br />Follow for more videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/spokeishere">https://twitter.com/spokeishere</a><br /><br />Like ParrotX2 and his LifeSteal SMP Series where he broke bedrock or blew up 2000 TNT. Not Technoblade / TommyInnit / or any other Dream SMP member. This is a new and original Minecraft idea like HermitCraft or LastLife with Grian and MumboJumbo. Survival is harder than Hardcore Minecraft because PVP is on. <br /><br />Freatures: @Parrot @PrinceZam @Mapicc @TheTerrain @Poafa @Reddoons @Playboi Carti @Don Turnt<br /><br />Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/rvkqzncuGJ">https://discord.gg/rvkqzncuGJ</a><br /><br />A Minecraft video made by Spoke or SpokeIsHere on other platforms! Enjoy! This was made on the Unstable SMP.{% endraw %}
