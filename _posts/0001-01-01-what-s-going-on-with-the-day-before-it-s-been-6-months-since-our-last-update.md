{% raw %}It's been 6 months since our last update and news on The Day Before has been pretty sparse since. What's going on with the game? And what are the odds it still launches this June?<br /><br />#TheDayBefore #Survival #MMO<br /><br />About The Day Before<br /><br />This is an open-world Survival MMO set in a deadly, post-pandemic America overrun by flesh-hungry infected and survivors killing each other for food, weapons, and cars. <br /><br />- Explore a huge, detailed world with large cities and towns, snow-capped mountains, rivers and forests, all while traveling either on foot or in vehicles.<br />- Search abandoned vehicles, houses, and skyscrapers as you scavenge for resources.<br />- Visit survivor colonies where we can sell loot, trade and communicate with other players.<br />- Fight off infected, as well as other players using realistic weapons.<br />- This is a PvP-focused game, but will have plenty of interesting activities for PvE fans.<br />- Developed on the latest version of Unreal Engine.<br /><br />My gear:<br />Headphones – V-MODA Crossfade M-100 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3w7NVNk">https://amzn.to/3w7NVNk</a><br />Mic – Shure SM7B <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2NZdWxn">https://amzn.to/2NZdWxn</a><br />Mixer – GOXLR Mini <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2P60jgu">https://amzn.to/2P60jgu</a><br />Computer – Doghouse Armor TL <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.doghousesystems.com/">https://www.doghousesystems.com/</a> (use code FORCE for free 500GB SSD with purchase of any system){% endraw %}
