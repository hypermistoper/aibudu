I am not in ANY way obligated to mention these products and if I have done so, it is because I genuinely like them. I would NEVER talk about or show something I didn't genuinely love.<br /><br />Sometimes, I may be sponsored by brands for videos. I turn down 90% of sponsorship opportunities. I will not accept unless I love the brand/product already. All products/items will still have been chosen by myself, and the video concept will always be my own idea. I would never endorse a brand/product that I didn't truly love and believe in.<br /><br />I use affiliate links in the description box of this channel. This means I earn a very small percentage when you purchase a product I recommend- the same way a sales associate in a store earns commission when they help you select a product. This does not in any way affect the price you pay for the item, and absolutely does not influence my choice of items to show you. <br /><br />Lots of love,<br /><br />Freds x{% endraw %}
