Ooh how I love fooood.<br />Coley ‚Äì That is not food. That is junk food! And you know that junk food is unhealthy, right?<br />Bumbley ‚Äì I know, I know. But why? I mean how can something that tastes so good, be so bad for us? <br />Coley ‚Äì It is quite simple Bumbley. We need food to supply us with nutrients. Nutrients which are used to build our body and fuel it.<br />Bumbley‚Äì Why can‚Äôt junk food do that for us?<br />Coley ‚Äì Because junk food doesn‚Äôt have enough nutrients in it. It does not give you energy to play or stay strong.<br />Bumbley ‚Äì I don‚Äôt mind not playing if I can have an extra burger. (One burger eating another burger and burping)<br />Coley ‚Äì Really? No play for a burger?<br />Bumbley ‚Äì Actually, I won‚Äôt mind both. Play and junk food (Burger trying to balance itself on a ball)<br />Coley ‚Äì You can have both. You can have your burger if you eat fruits too. That way you are giving your body enough nourishment too.<br />Bumbley ‚Äì I am sleepy now.<br />Coley ‚Äì Oh, yes. Junk food makes you sleepy and tired too. You can sleep if you want. I am gonna go and play basketball.<br />Bumbley ‚Äì Hey, wait for me! I promise, I will eat fruits and veggies too. Because I wanna play and have fun!<br /><br />#WhyisJunkFoodUnhealthy #HealthTips #AskColey<br /><br />To learn more about Why is junk food unhealthy?, visit the best e-learning website here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mocomi.com/why-is-junk-food-unhealthy/">https://mocomi.com/why-is-junk-food-unhealthy/</a> <br /><br />For more fun learning health tips and good habits, visit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mocomi.com/learn/new-world/ask-coley/">https://mocomi.com/learn/new-world/ask-coley/</a><br /><br />Watch more ask coley videos in one go here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrIPt0fi9vk&amp;list=PL6vCwGtCTVtOEYlvjEu5c3SCN99aP12bh">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrIPt0fi9vk&amp;list=PL6vCwGtCTVtOEYlvjEu5c3SCN99aP12bh</a><br /><br />Watch more educational content for Kids here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mocomi.com/">https://mocomi.com/</a> - Top educational website for kids,<br /><br />Subscribe here for new and interesting content every week ‚ñ∫ ‚ñ∫ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/mocomikids?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/mocomikids?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Press Bell Icon üîî For Latest Updates. <br />Thanks for watching!
