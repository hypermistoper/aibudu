{% raw %}Dr Tsakok presents her research on the genetic factors driving allergic disease.<br /><br />Allergic disease has been increasing globally for the last few decades, with now around 30% of adults suffering some kind of allergy. Nickel allergy is among the commonest causes of allergic contact dermatitis, or contact allergy, where the skin reacts to a usually harmless substance. Nickel allergy is often associated with common items such as jewelry, zips and glasses frames.<br /><br />While the hygiene hypothesis - an environmental cause - is often cited as the reason for increasing levels of allergies, Dr Tsakok's research investigates the potential genetic drivers of allergic disease.<br /><br />By using large cohort twin studies, including whole genome sequencing, patch testing and metabolics, her work aims to estimate the heritability of delayed nickel sensitivity, or contact dermatitis. By identifying common genetic variants - single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs - associated with allergies, this work looks to provide future insights into the biochemical mechanisms of allergy and potentially how to prevent it.<br /><br />Dr Teresa Tsakok is an Academic Clinical Fellow at Guys and St Thomas's Foundation Trust.<br /><br />Dr Teresa Tsakok gave this short research presentation, 'The BRC Allergene Project: Heritability of nickel allergy and genetic determinants', at the finals of the Oral Plenary Competition at the Spring Meeting for Clinician Scientists in Training 2013.
