The two tracker EP consists of Chapter I and II, which are a continuation of each other’s story. ‘’Unending’' sees trio keep exploring the darker side of dance music.<br /> <br />Chapter 1 opens with melancholy piano notes and limp percussion that creates a cinematic and ethereal experience. The cleverly placed electronica style drum kicks and dark hearted monolith bass, which come after the slowly rising evocative sounds, trap the listeners in much more layered composition. The energetic atmospheric lead melody throughout the track gives a hint for Chapter II, while the epic dramatic pad sound offers an almost auditory contrast.<br /> <br />Atmospheric exploration continues as it moves from Chapter I to Chapter II, but this time develops into 4/4 club focused formula. Hypnotic bassline unleashed by the main riff and piano chords begin to build up before slamming listeners back down into the unbridled euphoria.<br /><br />#Triart #Unending #EtherealFuture #FutureForward<br /><br /><br />Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://spoti.fi/3uwq9fB">https://spoti.fi/3uwq9fB</a><br />SoundCloud: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/futureforwardmusic">https://soundcloud.com/futureforwardmusic</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/futureforwardmedia">http://www.instagram.com/futureforwardmedia</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/futureforwardmedia">http://www.facebook.com/futureforwardmedia</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/FFMedia_FFMedia">https://twitter.com/FFMedia_FFMedia</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.futureforward.media">http://www.futureforward.media</a>{% endraw %}
