{% raw %}The potential of a digital dollar has generated key questions on the design and implementation of central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). This is especially relevant for the United States because of potential security risks and challenges in an international context.<br /><br />Please join the CSIS Economics Program and Ghadar Family Foundation on June 1 at 9:00am EST for the last of three public events on major issues for a potential digital dollar. This event will feature a panel discussion between Miguel Díaz, head of the Toronto Centre for BIS, Dr. Fariborz Ghadar, Schreyer Chair holder and Professor of Global Management, Policies, and Planning at the Smeal College of Business at Pennsylvania State University and Senior Advisor and Distinguished Scholar at CSIS, and Steven Kamin, Senior Associate (non-resident) of the CSIS Economics Program. Gerard DiPippo, Senior Fellow for the CSIS Economics Program, will moderate the conversation.<br /><br />Gerard DiPippo published a recent piece on options for a U.S. CBDC, and contributing expert to the series Fariborz Ghadar has an upcoming book entitled Hurry and Get it Right: The Urgent Need for Digital Policy Frameworks. If you missed the first event on the promises and pitfalls of a potential U.S. CBDC, watch here. If you missed the second event on key regulatory and technological considerations, watch here.<br /><br />This event is made possible through the generous support of the Ghadar Family Foundation<br />---------------------------------------------<br />A nonpartisan institution, CSIS is the top national security think tank in the world. <br />Visit www.csis.org to find more of our work as we bring bipartisan solutions to the world's greatest challenges.<br /><br />Want to see more videos and virtual events?
