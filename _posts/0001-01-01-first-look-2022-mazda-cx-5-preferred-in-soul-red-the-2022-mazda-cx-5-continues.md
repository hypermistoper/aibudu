{% raw %}The 2022 Mazda CX-5 continues with the Preferred package minus the SV.  In that case, we lost the Bose sound system as with the Carbon Edition.  <br /><br />However, we continue with full leather, heated seats with memory.  An upgrade first seen in 2021.  This package upgrades from the Select and also includes a power moonroof and rear power lift gate. <br /><br />#preferred #cx5 #mazda #2022cx5 #jonathansewellsells #morecarvids #mitchellmazda<br /><br />Support the channel by wearing merchandise available at www.jonathansewell.shop<br /><br />Jonathan Sewell Sells<br />Mitchell Mazda<br />1222 Rucker Boulevard<br />Enterprise, Alabama 36330{% endraw %}
