{% raw %}Today we take a look around DHL NEXT - Hams Hall, Sutton Coldfield B76 0BE.<br /><br />When we first arrive we are disgusted with the amount of rubbish along the back fence so we let security know about it when they call us over.<br /><br />We then have a look around the front but have to walk on the road due to vehicles blocking the pedestrian footpath.<br /><br />We decide to ask for someone in charge to report these matters to but they are too busy and ask us to wait.<br /><br />Whilst waiting we walk around the car park and notice a couple a illegal number plates to add to the list.<br /><br />Eventually we spot a senior figure arrive in his car so we report the concerns to him and then leave.<br /><br />The security and staff hated the camera but without reporting the issue and holding them to account then we feel no action would have been taken about these serious issues.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br />________________________<br /><br />Q - What is your email address?<br />A - djaudits@gmail.com<br /><br />Q - What Drone Do I Use<br />A - DJI MINI 2 <br />Can be purchased here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3ICW9Dp">https://amzn.to/3ICW9Dp</a><br />Q - What Camera Do I Use<br />A - DJI OSMO POCKET 2<br />Can be purchased here - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/30bEMs4">https://amzn.to/30bEMs4</a>{% endraw %}
