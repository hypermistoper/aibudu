True female reproductive health, which is the foundation of everyone’s health, requires that the social systems in which we live allow us to make informed choices about what is best for each of us.” This passage from Like A Mother captures exactly why I wrote the song Our Bodies. Thank you Angela Garbes for this beautiful book and bringing women’s health to the forefront of issues important to us all.... &quot;<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bbislandmusic.com/she-keeps-bees">https://bbislandmusic.com/she-keeps-bees</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/shekeepsbees">https://twitter.com/shekeepsbees</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shekeepsbees/">https://www.instagram.com/shekeepsbees/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/shekeepsbees/">https://www.facebook.com/shekeepsbees/</a><br /><br />#SheKeepsBees #BBIsland{% endraw %}
