{% raw %}This old chimney had to go! Here's what it looks like when sped up like crazy.<br /><br />We removed a fireplace from a house we have been working on. With the help of several people we were able to remove the chimney and fireplace and patch the resulting hold in the roof. Take a look at this time lapse to see it done in 2 minutes!<br /><br />Oh, one more thing... at about 0:37 there's butt crack (thanks John Doe), you've been warned...{% endraw %}
