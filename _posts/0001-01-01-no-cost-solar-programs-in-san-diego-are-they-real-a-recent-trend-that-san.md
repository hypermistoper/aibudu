{% raw %}A recent trend that San Diego homeowners have been seeing on Facebook and other social media sites are ads for &quot;free solar&quot; and &quot;no-cost solar&quot; - which often disguise themselves as articles or government programs. These ads seem too good to be true - and the truth is they are.<br /><br />These ads are often published by lead generation companies that use false claims and clickbait to get homeowners to submit their information, which they then sell to solar companies. <br /><br />In this video, we explain why &quot;no-cost solar&quot; isn't real, and we go over how to identify scammy solar ads, so that San Diego homeowners can avoid being duped.<br /><br />If you're looking for a real solar company in San Diego, contact us at Stellar Solar.
