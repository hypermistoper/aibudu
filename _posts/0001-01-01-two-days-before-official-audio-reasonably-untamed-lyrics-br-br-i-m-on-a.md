{% raw %}LYRICS:<br /><br />I'm on a flight away<br />From everything, I'm Leaving<br />And though my heart may break<br />My body keeps on breathing<br /><br />They're serving eight ounce cups<br />And to future luck, I'm drinking<br />I'm flying up and up, yet I<br />Feel like I'm sinking<br /><br />And If I could<br />I'd stay for a spell<br />Get enchanted on a wishing well<br /><br />And If I could<br />I'd see us through<br />Wish for more time, with no time to loose<br /><br />Cause your leaving on Tuesday<br />And I'm on a plane two days before<br />Yeah your leaving on Tuesday<br />And I'm on a plane Two Days Before<br /><br />And to distract myself<br />I spell your whole name out, on the ceiling<br />And every page I count<br />In this magazine, I've been reading<br /><br />And with my feet flown out<br />From off the ground, I'm falling<br />But when this plane goes down<br />Safe and sound, I'll be calling<br /><br />And If I could<br />I'd stay for a spell<br />Get enchanted on a wishing well<br /><br />And If I could<br />I'd see us through<br />Wish for more time, with no time to loose<br /><br />Cause your leaving on Tuesday<br />And I'm on a plane two days before<br />Yeah your leaving on Tuesday<br />And I'm on a plane Two Days Before<br /><br />And If I could<br />I'd stay for a spell<br />Get enchanted on a wishing well<br /><br />And If I could<br />I'd see us through<br />Wish for more time, with no time to loose<br /><br />Cause your leaving on Tuesday<br />And I'm on a plane two days before<br />Yeah your leaving on Tuesday<br />And I'm on a plane Two Days Before<br /><br />Two Days Before<br />Two Days Before<br /><br />Music and Lyrics:<br />S.
