{% raw %}A guide to show you how to work out the equal spacing of stair spindles.<br />NOTE  Example is for up 1 metre base rail length so we just knock off 200 mm from initial gap between newel posts. <br />For a 2 metre base rail take off 400 mm from the initial measurement and 600 mm for a 3 metre base rail etc.<br />Likewise for on the rake 300 mm for a metre, 600 mm for 2 metre etc.<br />Taking off these initial figures from the gap between newels is just a way of quickly finding the probable number of spindles required and works 90% of the time.<br />If you then find the gap between spindles is to big or to small when you have done the initial calculation its only a case of adding or reducing the number of spindles by 1 normally. <br />Remember UK Building Regulations ask for a maximum gap of 99 mm.{% endraw %}
