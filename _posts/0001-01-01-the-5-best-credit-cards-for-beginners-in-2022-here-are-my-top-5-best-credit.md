DISCOVER IT SECURED CREDIT CARD<br />This card has NO ANNUAL FEE. And you will get you 2% cash back on restaurants and gas stations up to the first $1000, AND you’ll get unlimited 1% cash back on everything else. They’re also running a promotion where they will MATCH your cash back in the first year. Not only that, but Discover also allows you to monitor your FICO score for free on their platform, so you can keep track of how your score is improving over time. <br /><br />2. PETAL 2 VISA CARD<br />This one also has NO ANNUAL FEE, and they base your credit limit on your banking history - meaning, you have the potential of getting approved without any prior credit history, at all. Since they utilize your banking information, they also double as a personal finance app that calculates your payments, interest if you don’t pay off your balance, your monthly spending, and other personal finance tips to help you save money. <br /><br />3. AMAZON PRIME REWARDS CARD<br />If you get the Amazon Prime Rewards Card - which  requires you to have a valid Amazon Prime membership to get the full benefit, you’ll get a $100-$150 amazon gift card for signing up, and then you’ll get unlimited 5% cash back on all amazon and Whole Foods purchases, and 2% cash back at restaurants, gas stations, and drugstores…and then 1% cash back on everything else. <br /><br />4. THE CHASE FREEDOM FLEX CARD<br />First, they’ll be giving you a $200 bonus when you spend only $500 on purchases within the first 3 months. They’ll also offer you 5% cash back on up to $1500 worth of bonus categories, 5% back on travel through the ultimate rewards portal, 3% back at restaurants and dining….3% on drugstores…and 1% back on everything else. <br /><br />5. CITI DOUBLECASH REWARDS CREDIT CARD<br />You'll have no annual fee, and UNLIMITED 2% cash back on everything: 1% when you make a purchase, and 1% when you pay it off. Simple!<br /><br />GUIDE TO GETTING A PERFECT CREDIT SCORE: <br /><br />First, sign up for a free credit monitoring service like CreditKarma.com or CreditSesame.com. <br /><br />Second, get yourself the Discover It Secured Credit Card…or, the Petal 2 Visa card if you get approved. From there, just put a few minor expenses on the card every week…and then, pay it off, in full, by the time it’s due…that’s it.<br /><br />Third, after 6 months of doing that - add ANOTHER credit card to the list, like the Amazon Prime Card, Chase Freedom Flex, or Citi Doublecash. Then…do the same thing as the first step: put a few minor charges on the card, and pay it off in full by the time it’s due. <br /><br />Fourth, after another 6 months of doing that - open the American Express Blue Cash Charge Card, and then - repeat the same process. You see how easy this is? ALWAYS PAY THEM OFF IN FULL. <br /><br />Fifth, after another 6 months of paying on time - request a credit limit increases on all of your credit cards….even if you don’t need a higher limit. <br /><br />Sixth, keep doing this consistently - and within 18-24 months, assuming you carry a zero balance and always pay on time…you should have a score above 740-780, which gets you the lowest interest rates any time you want to leverage your money, get a mortgage, rent an apartment, buy a car…or, do anything, really. <br /><br />ENJOY!<br /><br />My ENTIRE Camera and Recording Equipment: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB">https://www.amazon.com/shop/grahamstephan?listId=2TNWZ7RP1P1EB</a><br /><br />For business or one-on-one real estate investing/real estate agent consulting inquiries, you can reach me at GrahamStephanBusiness@gmail.com<br /><br />*Some of the links and other products that appear on this video are from companies which Graham Stephan will earn an affiliate commission or referral bonus.
