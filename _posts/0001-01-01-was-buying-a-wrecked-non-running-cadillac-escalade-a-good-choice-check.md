My wife and I bought this thing for parts, mainly to have an extra LS powertrain lying around for an upcoming project.  In addition to the many parts we're able to use, there's also a lot of opportunity to make additional revenue via selling all of the unused parts that this has to offer!  First and foremost, we need to see if we can get the Escalade running.  Although it passed my &quot;visual&quot; inspection, we had no way to fire it up at the time of purchase due to the accident's resulting damage.  It was definitely a gamble, but the opportunity was too good to pass up!  I hope you all enjoy the video!<br /><br />My Social Media Channels:<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/saabkyle04llc/">http://instagram.com/saabkyle04llc/</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Saabkyle04LLC">https://twitter.com/Saabkyle04LLC</a><br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Saabkyle04LLC">https://www.facebook.com/Saabkyle04LLC</a><br /><br />I know you’re probably asking yourself, what exactly is Saabkyle04 and why should I subscribe?
