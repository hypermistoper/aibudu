{% raw %}English isn't my first language, so for years I didn't put a description under my videos but I do now. <br /><br />I want to ask anyone who shares my videos to please give me credit. It takes so much time and effort to make them, I have to search for the clips, choose the music, put the overlays and text, etc. Some people have asked me if they could use my videos, and as long as they gave me credits, I have no problem with it. <br /><br />It's discouraging to find stolen videos with more views than the originals I made (I think this applies to every editor out there). <br /><br />Thanks for reading this and thanks for all the support you showed to my channel all these years, especially all the lovely comments ❤️<br /><br /><br />You can support my channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://ko-fi.com/consufrutos">https://ko-fi.com/consufrutos</a><br /><br />If you like the video subscribe and give it a like and comment ♡{% endraw %}
