However this now brings us back to a forum leak from February that predicted this exact name and maybe this might not have been a false one.<br /><br />It predicted a bunch of features from player housing to new professions and most importantly with 6 new zones to be added in the expansion with some old ones revamped, together with 4 brand new classes with a single spec and a bunch of class skins such as necromancer skin for warlocks, for example. Could these dragonflight features actually be real?<br /><br />All of the footage used in the video is copyrighted by Blizzard Entertainment unless stated otherwise. Due to images being shared across various sites it is quite difficult to find who the original artists are.
