{% raw %}Javelin missiles Ukraine blows up hundreds of convoys of Russian military in Donbas region<br /><br />The Ukrainians have been extremely effective against Russian convoys and armored vehicles with anti-armor weapons such as the US-built Javelin anti-tank weapons, perhaps due to a blend of innovative ambush tactics and and strategic attacks in narrowly configured passageways or intersections<br /><br />While most observers and weapons developers are likely to stop well short of using the word “obsolete” when it comes to tank warfare, however does the Ukrainian success highlight the prospect that heavily armored tanks are in fact more vulnerable than may have been anticipated<br /><br />Thanks For Watching<br />The Thumbnail/Videos are for illustrasion purpose only<br /><br />#russian #ukraine #javelinmissiles{% endraw %}
