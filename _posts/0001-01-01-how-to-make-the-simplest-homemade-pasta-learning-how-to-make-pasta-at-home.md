{% raw %}Learning how to make pasta at home is WAY easier than you think! Homemade pasta is a pantry staple you can make with THREE simple ingredients-- you're gonna love it! *CLICK SHOW MORE FOR RECIPE*<br /><br />‚û°Ô∏è‚û°Ô∏è GET MY COOKBOOK: www.homesteadcookbook.com<br /><br />Get the full recipe &amp; instructions: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2015/02/homemade-pasta-recipe.html">https://www.theprairiehomestead.com/2015/02/homemade-pasta-recipe.html</a><br /><br />The Easiest Bread You'll Ever Make: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsgUcpTLQww">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BsgUcpTLQww</a><br /><br />NO-FUSS HOMEMADE PASTA<br /><br />2 cups flour<br />1/2 teaspoon sea salt<br />3 large eggs<br /><br />Combine the flour and salt.<br /><br />Make a well in the center of the flour, and add the eggs.<br /><br />Gently begin to mix the eggs, gradually drawing in flour with each stroke. Eventually a stiff dough will form.<br /><br />Knead the pasta dough for 6-7 minutes.<br /><br />If the dough is too dry and won‚Äôt stick together, add a 1/2 teaspoon of water. If it is too sticky, sprinkle in a bit more flour.<br /><br />Keep in mind this dough will be much stiffer than your traditional bread doughs. However, the longer you work it, the smoother and more pliable it will become.<br /><br />We are looking for a smooth, satiny consistency, which will begin to develop the more you knead.<br /><br />Cover the well-kneaded dough tightly with plastic wrap, and allow it to rest for around 45 minutes. (This resting phase is super important, as it gives the dough time to relax. Otherwise, you‚Äôll fight it the whole time you are rolling it out.)<br /><br />After the resting period, divide the dough into four portions. <br /><br />Pasta Machine Instructions:<br />Rolling the dough is a process‚Äì you need to make several passes, throughout each thickness setting for the best results. I start with the biggest setting (usually 5 or 6), run it through once or twice there, and then start gradually adjust the settings to be thinner and thinner until I have the perfect sheet of golden pasta.<br /><br />Between each pass, I like to fold the strip into thirds. This helps square up the edges and keeps things even. Then simply roll it through the cutting side of the machine to slice into spaghetti or fettucine.<br /><br />Rolling Pin Instructions:<br /><br />If you don‚Äôt have a pasta machine, you can simply use a rolling pin and knife (or pizza cutter). Keep in mind you‚Äôll want to roll it out as thin as humanly possible, as it will plump up considerably once you cook it.<br /><br />Roll each portion of dough out on a well-flour surface and then cut into thin strips. Your noodles will be more rustic, but they‚Äôll still taste amazing.<br /><br />From here, you can either cook your pasta right away (3-4 minutes in boiling water) or dry it.<br />It also freezes well‚Äì just make sure you don‚Äôt throw it into the freezer in a big lump, because then you‚Äôll end up with a pasta dumpling when you go to cook it.<br /><br />Serve your perfect homemade pasta with homemade sauces, or olive oil, Parmesan, and fresh herbs.<br /><br />üß¢ We have Old-Fashioned on Purpose Gear! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://homesteadswag.com">https://homesteadswag.com</a><br /><br />üêì LIVE OLD-FASHIONED ON PURPOSE:<br />+ The Prairie Homestead Cookbook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://homesteadcookbook.com">http://homesteadcookbook.com</a><br />+ Learn How to Cook Like a Homesteader: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://heritagecookingclass.com">http://heritagecookingclass.com</a><br />+ Learn How to Can (Safely!): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://learnhowtocan.com/learntocan3">http://learnhowtocan.com/learntocan3</a><br /><br />üåé OTHER PLACES WE HANG OUT:<br />+ The Old-Fashioned on Purpose Podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://oldfashionedonpurpose.com">http://oldfashionedonpurpose.com</a><br />+ The Prairie Homestead Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://theprairiehomestead.com">http://theprairiehomestead.com</a><br />+ Follow Along on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/theprairiehomestead">http://instagram.com/theprairiehomestead</a>{% endraw %}
