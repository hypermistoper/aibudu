Both function similarly based on monthly subscriptions. Patreon deducts up to 20% of your donation. Our website will not and will allow you to post photos and audios. <br />a) Save this website to your mobile home screen &amp; choose &quot;online church&quot; or &quot;inner circle&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discoverchurch.online/">https://discoverchurch.online/</a> <br />b) Become a Patron at: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/cioccolanti">https://www.patreon.com/cioccolanti</a> You will get audios, videos, posts and photos not shared on any other social media.<br /><br />✝️ 2) Tithe to your home church and give offerings on DiscoverChurch.Online. Some Christians have been mistaught that tithing is not found in the New Testament, which is false doctrine: read Luke 11:42 and Hebrews 7:8. God teaches that the tithe (10% of income) is His and must be returned to the place that feeds you spiritually. If you reside in a geographical location without a Bible-teaching church, you may treat us as your online church. <br /><br />✅ Separate to tithes, you can sow offerings to any ministry that feeds you according to Galatians 6:6. Offerings can be any amount. We believe the $58 seed is prophetic. Contribute to God's ministry: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.discover.org.au/partner">http://www.discover.org.au/partner</a> <br /><br />✝️ 3) Pray with and for Discover Ministries (Colossians 4:3, 2 Corinthians 1:11) Here are some model prayers you can start with: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.discover.org.au/pray">http://www.discover.org.au/pray</a> (There is a prayer group where you can send prayer requests and pray for others inside www.DiscoverChurch.Online) <br /><br />✝️ 4) Spread Jesus, the Word of God, to your family and friends. Invite friends and the unchurched to discover the online church community where they can connect, grow and belong. Giving books and DVDs is another way to spread the Good News. Before giving Christian books or videos, first pray in faith for those people you want to be saved. For help refer to a model prayer from Pastor Cioccolanti's life called “6 Steps” and use it right away!<br /><br />✅ BE PART of an END-TIME NETWORK of like-minded believers and collaborators.. <br />✝️ JOIN DISCOVER CHURCH ONLINE today! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discoverchurch.online/">https://discoverchurch.online/</a> <br /><br />-------------------------------<br />✅ YES, I'd like to help Discover Church keep reaching the lost and awaken the sleeping virgins of the Church:<br /><br />🌷DONATE via PayPal, your credit card or bank transfer: www.discover.org.au/give<br />🌷TAX DEDUCTIBLE DONATIONS now available to US residents only: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.USAChurch.Online">https://www.USAChurch.Online</a><br /><br />✅ By GIVING you partake in the divine grace and eternal rewards of this ministry!<br /><br />(c) 2022 Steve Cioccolanti.
