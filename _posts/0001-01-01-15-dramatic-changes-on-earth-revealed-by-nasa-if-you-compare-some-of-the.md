{% raw %}If you compare some of the photographs which can be found on NASA’s website, you can really see how human beings have changed the appearance of our world over the years. The time difference between these images ranges from five to 100 years. Incredible stuff.<br /><br />Other videos you might like:<br />What If Dinosaurs Were Still Alive Today? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeFnH4xux7w&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeFnH4xux7w&amp;</a><br />A Unique Creature on Earth That Can Never Be Killed <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8893cgbUfg&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8893cgbUfg&amp;</a><br />The Solar System Is Not Like You Think It Is <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FvpAe3MacM&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-FvpAe3MacM&amp;</a><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS: <br />Pedersen Glacier, Alaska 0:20<br />Aral Sea, Central Asia 0:44<br />Lake Oroville, California 1:06<br />Carroll Glacier, Alaska 1:22<br />Powell Lake, Arizona and Utah 1:50<br />Bear Glacier, Alaska 2:19<br />Forests in Rondonia, Brazil 2:45<br />McCarty Glacier, Alaska 3:03<br />The Dasht River, Pakistan 3:22<br />Matterhorn Mountain in the Alps 3:38<br />Toboggan Glacier, Alaska 3:54<br />Great Man-Made River, Libya 4:16<br />Qori Kalis Glacier, Peru 4:35<br />Mar Chiquita Lake, Argentina 4:52<br />Muir Glacier, Alaska 5:08<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />- Pedersen Glacier is an outlet glacier located in Kenai Fjords National Park near Seward. The photo taken in 1917 shows that it was an ordinary massive glacier once. No icebergs are visible anymore.<br />- The Aral Sea in Kazakhstan almost disappeared by 2014 due to the extensive irrigation of cotton fields.<br />- Lake Oroville was hit hard by the lack of water while California was suffering from a severe drought.<br />- The photo taken at the same place almost 100 years later shows that the Carroll glacier still exists, but it has serious problems. The ice cap has melted and has been covered with natural debris.<br />- Powell Lake is an artificial reservoir located on the Colorado River. It’s easy to notice that its water level has reduced over 15 years.<br />- The rise in temperature from 1950 to 1990 caused the giant Bear Glacier to retreat by one mile. From 2000 to 2005, it moved another two miles.<br />- Since the 1960s, Amazon rain forests have been actively cut down. According to current estimates, they now have about 80% left. The state of Rondonia in Brazil lost most of its forests.<br />- Toboggan Glacier covered a large territory once. Unfortunately, like many other glaciers on our planet, this one keeps melting fast. Comparing the two photos, you can see that there is less snow in 2000.<br />- Qori Kalis Glacier located in the Andes mountains of Peru. Frankly speaking, it's almost impossible to recognize this place nowadays – the difference is truly shocking.<br />- Mar Chiquita Lake is the biggest salt lake in South America. As you see, it has become smaller in recent years, but the area still looks lush.<br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />For copyright matters please contact us at: welcome@brightside.me<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Our Social Media:<br /><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC ">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC </a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
