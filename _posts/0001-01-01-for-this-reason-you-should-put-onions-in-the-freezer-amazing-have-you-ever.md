{% raw %}Have you ever put onions in the freezer? - Here I show you why that's a good idea!<br /><br /><br />‚úÖ Is HERE something for you? ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Hi7tEy">https://amzn.to/3Hi7tEy</a> *<br /><br /><br />You surely know the problem when cutting onions. Tears come straight to your eyes, even if you don't want them to. But so that no tears come to you when cutting onions, there is a little trick that I would like to show you here.<br /><br />Because you can simply put your onions in the freezer before cutting! This changes the structure of the onion and the enzyme which triggers the tears in you, is frozen. It is enough if you put the onions in the freezer for about 15 minutes before you cut them. Then take them out and cut them directly.<br /><br />You'll notice that you won't have tears when you cut them. Try this little trick with the onion therefore necessarily once, if you no longer want the tears come when you cut onions!<br /><br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />‚ùå THIS must not be missing in any household! ‚ùå<br /><br />‚úÖ Washing Soda ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3nafQKa">https://amzn.to/3nafQKa</a> *<br />‚úÖ Baking Soda ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3Dha8f6">https://amzn.to/3Dha8f6</a> *<br />‚úÖ Citric Acid ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3DgGUgt">https://amzn.to/3DgGUgt</a> *<br />‚úÖ Vinegar ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3cbH9xz">https://amzn.to/3cbH9xz</a> *<br />‚úÖ Microfiber Cloth ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2YGgG82">https://amzn.to/2YGgG82</a> *<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Subscribe to my Channel for Free ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8c3P7NxLr7k6XRC6VVMJmg?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8c3P7NxLr7k6XRC6VVMJmg?sub_confirmation=1</a> ‚òëÔ∏è<br /><br /><br />* I use so-called affiliate links here.
