We are really excited to be working outside again but at the same time, this is a physically tough job.  Pressure treated plywood needs to be installed on the underside of our house which means we are working in a tight space with heavy material.  It's safe to say we will be hurting tomorrow.<br /><br />We are a couple who are building our own home from the ground up in the mountains of West Virginia.  After living near the city our entire lives we finally decided to sell it all, pack up our 3 kids and live in an RV on our 73 acres while building our own debt free, off-grid house and learning to live a more self-reliant life.<br />Our house build is documented entirely on our main channel &quot;Wild Wonderful Off-Grid&quot; and our family life vlogs can be found on our secondary channel &quot;Wild Wonderful After Show&quot;{% endraw %}
