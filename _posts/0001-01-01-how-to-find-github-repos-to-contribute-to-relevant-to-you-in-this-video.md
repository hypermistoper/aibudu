{% raw %}In this video I want to really quickly show you an extremely powerful search and filter functionality that is built into github.com that allows you to find codebases (code repositories) that are of interest to you, that are relevant to your skill-sets or just repos that are easy for beginners or in specific programming languages!<br /><br />As there are so many open source codebases out their in the world (a lot of which, including some of the bigger names, are hosted on Github (like NodeJs, Linux &amp; Kotlin)) you need a good way of filtering the masses in order to find repositories that are within your skill set or within a specific programming language or perhaps you are new to open source contribution and you want to find a repository that enables newbies to get involved (as open source should be for everyone!).<br /><br />Let me show you an already existing and easy to us tool, that actually not many people know about or use to it's full potential, that is already built in and fully available on the Github website...<br /><br />Enjoy &amp; good repo hunting!<br /><br />Links discussed in the video ======================<br /><br />My Git Tutorial Playlist:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58zsLtwzL60&amp;list=PL3Y9MECuxct0RMwdYcqoIjo-7ncRpTNLs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=58zsLtwzL60&amp;list=PL3Y9MECuxct0RMwdYcqoIjo-7ncRpTNLs</a><br /><br />Github Search &amp; Filter options:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://help.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests">https://help.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests</a><br /><br />=============================================<br /><br />Thank you so much for watching.
