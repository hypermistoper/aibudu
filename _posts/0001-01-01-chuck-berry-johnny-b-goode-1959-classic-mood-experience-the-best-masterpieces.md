With songs such as &quot;Maybellene&quot; (1955), &quot;Roll Over Beethoven&quot; (1956), &quot;Rock and Roll Music&quot; (1957) and &quot;Johnny B. Goode&quot; (1958), Berry refined and developed rhythm and blues into the major elements that made rock and roll distinctive, with lyrics focusing on teen life and consumerism and music featuring guitar solos and showmanship that were a major influence on subsequent rock music.<br />Born into a middle-class African-American family in St. Louis, Missouri, Berry had an interest in music from an early age and gave his first public performance at Sumner High School. While still a high-school student he was convicted of armed robbery and was sent to a reformatory, where he was held from 1944 to 1947. After his release, Berry settled into married life and worked at an automobile assembly plant. By early 1953, influenced by the guitar riffs and showmanship techniques of the blues musician T-Bone Walker, Berry began performing with the Johnnie Johnson Trio. His break came when he traveled to Chicago in May 1955 and met Muddy Waters, who suggested he contact Leonard Chess, of Chess Records. With Chess he recorded &quot;Maybellene&quot;â€”Berry's adaptation of the country song &quot;Ida Red&quot;â€”which sold over a million copies, reaching number one on Billboard magazine's rhythm and blues chart. By the end of the 1950s, Berry was an established star with several hit records and film appearances and a lucrative touring career. He had also established his own St. Louis nightclub, Berry's Club Bandstand. But in January 1962, he was sentenced to three years in prison for offenses under the Mann Actâ€”he had transported a 14-year-old girl across state lines.<br />FROM WIKIPEDIA: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Berry">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Berry</a> ðŸŽ·ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽ·ðŸŽ¶ ðŸŽ·ðŸŽ¶ <br /><br />Subscribe to our channel for the best music masterpieces: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/ClassicMoodExperience">http://bit.ly/ClassicMoodExperience</a><br /><br />Classic Mood Experience The best masterpieces ever recorded in the music history.<br /><br />Explore Classic Mood Experience music, the bestÂ  jazz, blues, rock, pop, R&amp;B, soul, lantin songs ever recorded by Etta James, Billie Holiday, Bill Evans, Stevie Wonder, Ray Charles, Nina Simone, Muddy Waters, Django Reinhardt, Louis Armstrong, Miles Davis, James Brown, Chet Baker, Frank Sinatra, Ella Fitzgerald, Harry Belafonte, Nat King Cole, Louis Prima, Duke Ellington, Elvis Presley, Count Basie, Little Walter, Herbie Hancock, Edith Piaf, Aretha Franklin, Charlie Parker, Lightnin' Hopkins, Son House, B.B.
