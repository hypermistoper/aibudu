{% raw %}Veteran benefits are available to all 100 disabled veterans, but the VA will not tell you about them. Once you reach 100% VA disability rating, the VA does not provide a list of veterans' benefits. P&amp;T isn't even disclosed to you; you have to look for it in your VA account's letters section. Listed below are ten of the most valuable veterans benefits, and other benefits may exist depending on your state of residence.<br /><br />00:00 Introduction<br />00:45 VA Disability Compensation Pay<br />1:28 VA Dental Benefits For 100 Percent Disabled Veterans<br />2:48 CHAMP VA Healthcare Benefits for Dependents<br />4:28 VA Special Monthly Compensation Pay<br />5:40 VA Aid and Attendance Benefits<br />5:56 VA Housebound Benefits<br />6:58 VA Healthcare Benefits<br />9:05 Veteran Student Loan Forgiveness<br />9:54 VA Dependents Educational Assistance (DEA)<br />11:04 Property Tax Exemptions for 100 Percent Disabled Veterans<br />11:35 State Benefits for 100 Disabled Veterans<br /><br />Useful links:<br />VA Aid and Attendance &amp; Housebound Benefits<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.va.gov/pension/aid-attendance-housebound/">https://www.va.gov/pension/aid-attendance-housebound/</a><br /><br />Total and Permanent Disability Discharge<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/disability-discharge">https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/disability-discharge</a><br /><br />Survivors’ and Dependents’ Educational Assistance<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.va.gov/education/survivor-dependent-benefits/dependents-education-assistance/">https://www.va.gov/education/survivor-dependent-benefits/dependents-education-assistance/</a><br /><br />Full List of Property Tax Exemptions By State<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://militarybenefits.info/property-tax-exemptions-state/">https://militarybenefits.info/property-tax-exemptions-state/</a><br /><br />🔵  If you are looking for a Nexus Letter for Mental Health and all other Medical Conditions, here is the email of one of our partners:  medicalexperts@2ndStrata.com (Please Include Your Phone #)<br /><br />🤠 Sign up for Boot Camp <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.combatcraig.com">http://www.combatcraig.com</a><br /><br />🎯 If you don’t know me already, my name is Combat Craig.
