{% raw %}Day 1 in The IRON Series and we begin with a complete leg day workout involving some of the main dumbbell movements to recruit as much muscle as possible within each rep. <br /><br />Being able to perform a movement through its full range of movement with control should be the aim. Of course we all have slightly different ways of performing the same movement including depth, foot position or range of movement available so it is important to always tweak to suit you such as toes pointed out slightly during squat if better or lower to knees and not beyond during RDLs.<br /><br />Even during this workout, you could consider it as ‘dynamic stretching’ as you are moving the joint through the range available. <br /><br />And use it as practice! Every workout I do is a practice session! I am forever thinking during each rep… rather than moving the weight from A to B, think about lifting ‘with’ the muscle too. Mind muscle connection can be powerful and hopefully we will see more research coming in future relating to the potential benefits of this in hypertrophy.<br />If you think about a bent over row… rather than allowing yourself to draw elbows up to move the weight, actually think about the muscles in your back contracting to lift the weight. This can be applied to nearly all movement patterns. Overtime, you become even more susceptible to this coming more naturally when you lift.<br /><br />Every workout I share is unedited. One take and it’s my entire workout so you will see me struggle for sure! And hopefully be able to see also the focus. <br /><br />I am constantly thinking as I lift and sometimes I may be thinking about one aspect when I then notice my foot isn’t perfectly inline with thigh or I could improve my neck being inline with my spine…I am saying this to remind you the importance of focus, especially when lifting. And that we all are improving continuously! <br /><br />Have fun lifting and use the next 6 weeks to improve even more! <br /><br />The dumbbells I am using for your reference are 15kg each!<br /><br />The timer will be on for 60 seconds per exercise with 30 seconds rest inbetween! <br /><br />SUITCASE SQUAT<br />SUITCASE SQUAT<br /><br />STATIC LUNGE<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br /><br />RDL<br />RDL<br />RDL<br /><br />REAR STEP LUNGE<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br /><br />PAUSE AT BOTTOM GOBLET SQUAT<br />PAUSE AT BOTTOM GOBLET SQUAT<br /><br />LATERAL LUNGE<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br />SWITCH SIDE!<br /><br />FINISHER:<br /><br />30/30/30/60<br /><br />1/2 REP GOBLET SQUAT<br />FULL RANGE!<br />1/2 REP!<br />BODYWEIGHT FULL RANGE!<br /><br />Let’s lift, let’s go!<br /><br />Cx<br /><br />……………………………………………………………<br /><br />Useful Links<br /><br />Don’t forget to Subscribe and turn on notifications so that you don’t miss any Workouts, Community Updates or Surprises: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/c/carolinegirvan/?sub_confirmation=1">https://youtube.com/c/carolinegirvan/?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Optional Add-ons<br /><br />5 Minute Warm Up: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/c0VxUFHdYzs">https://youtu.be/c0VxUFHdYzs</a> (Always warm up before any workout)<br />Today’s Optional Add-on Workout: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/uVwNVEQS_uo">https://youtu.be/uVwNVEQS_uo</a><br />20 Minute Stretch and Relax: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/y87vSUoIMGU">https://youtu.be/y87vSUoIMGU</a><br /><br />IRON Series Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhu1QCKrfgPWmStsg7imo5EQ0zmkxymJ2">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhu1QCKrfgPWmStsg7imo5EQ0zmkxymJ2</a><br />IRON Series Calendar: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carolinegirvan.com/IRON-Series-Calendar.pdf">https://carolinegirvan.com/IRON-Series-Calendar.pdf</a> (Printable)<br /><br />My Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://carolinegirvan.com">https://carolinegirvan.com</a><br />Caroline Girvan Community: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/groups/carolinegirvan">https://facebook.com/groups/carolinegirvan</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/carolinegirvan">https://instagram.com/carolinegirvan</a><br />Business Enquiries Email: info@carolinegirvan.com<br /><br />Ab Workouts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhu1QCKrfgPX_3_Fir25lT1zjLvmjifl7">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhu1QCKrfgPX_3_Fir25lT1zjLvmjifl7</a><br />Cardio Workouts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhu1QCKrfgPVj9hpw_O3t1LoUcqUWpJio">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhu1QCKrfgPVj9hpw_O3t1LoUcqUWpJio</a><br />HIIT Workouts: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhu1QCKrfgPXHHqpj3cBJkNSRwF3P3h2k">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhu1QCKrfgPXHHqpj3cBJkNSRwF3P3h2k</a><br /><br />Here is the link to my favourite cardio workout just for your reference! <br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/FgqmrQ2rnfM">https://youtu.be/FgqmrQ2rnfM</a><br /><br />……………………………………………………………<br /><br />Disclaimer: If you are new to exercise or planning on embarking on a new fitness programme, you should consult your physician.
