{% raw %}Mocap Suit Building Part 6<br /><br />In this video I have tried to clear up the concept of Low Pass Filter and how does it work, and then have implemented the logic in my code to eliminate the noise created by the accelerometer during the estimated inclination or tilt measurement. Although the implementation is not fully Low Pass Filter implementation, but given the dynamic variation of the data the cutoff measure has been considered as variable. The output is stable and the noise has almost eliminated by the filter, but I have encounter more problem which is leading me to understand other sensors to fuse the data with accelerometer data.<br /><br />This post detailed writeup: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/61781469">https://www.patreon.com/posts/61781469</a><br />Information and Links:<br />Previous video link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/YEOmMxwxn20">https://youtu.be/YEOmMxwxn20</a><br />Previous Paper Post: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/61594310">https://www.patreon.com/posts/61594310</a><br />Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnFVXCUAWlE&amp;list=PLCFP4Gs-mIbxZ0fJUaqIEaD0tAvFTQ8pl">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JnFVXCUAWlE&amp;list=PLCFP4Gs-mIbxZ0fJUaqIEaD0tAvFTQ8pl</a><br /><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/themakingofothers">https://www.patreon.com/themakingofothers</a><br /><br />Toptechboy Link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://toptechboy.com/arduino-based-9-axis-inertial-measurement-unit-imu-based-on-bno055-sensor/">https://toptechboy.com/arduino-based-9-axis-inertial-measurement-unit-imu-based-on-bno055-sensor/</a><br /><br />Special Thanks to Paul McWhorter, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfYfK0tzHZTpNFrc_NDKfTA.">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfYfK0tzHZTpNFrc_NDKfTA.</a><br /><br />Video Chapters:<br />00:00 Recap from previous episode<br />02:05 Why do we need Low Pass Filter for IMU / Why Accelerometer data requires Low Pass Filter<br />03:14 What is Low Pass Filter / Basic understanding of Low Pass Filter<br />03:33 What is Attenuate?<br />03:51 How Low Pass Filter works, with examples<br />05:25 Different output of Low Pass Filter for different precision<br />06:13 What is Kernel in Low Pass Filter?<br />06:30 What is Attenuation?<br />06:48 Sourcecode to implement Low Pass Filter <br />07:12 Low Pass Filter for Arduino / Low Pass Filter for Accelerometer<br />10:33 Problem in applying Low Pass Filter on accelerometer data<br />11:27 How to resolve the problem of Low Pass FIlter by using Sensor fusion<br />12:42 Low Pass Filter in 1 mins and Conclusion<br /><br />Music source: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects">https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects</a><br /><br />I am not an expert, I am learning while I am making this video.
