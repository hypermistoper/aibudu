I spent most of my time in the distribution and supply chain organizations.<br /><br />Before Tesla, I was a Director of Business Intelligence and Pricing at the largest Pet Food &amp; Supply distributor in the US, Phillips Pet Food &amp; Supplies based out of Easton, PA. My wife and I also owned a small business in Bethlehem, PA between 2016 and 2019.<br /><br />My thoughts are my own and are not representative of everyone who currently works, or has worked at Tesla.<br /><br />If you like this content I would greatly appreciate your likes and shares!<br /><br />www.farzadmesbahi.com<br />www.linkedin.com/in/farzadmesbahi<br />Twitter @farzyness<br /><br />Timestamps:<br />00:00 Elon Musk at Giga Berlin Opening<br />01:02 Introduction<br />02:24 Following the breadcrumbs...<br />11:35 Conclusion and wrap up{% endraw %}
