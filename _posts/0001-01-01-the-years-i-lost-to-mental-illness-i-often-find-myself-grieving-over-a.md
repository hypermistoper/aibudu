{% raw %}I often find myself grieving over a period of time in my life that it feels I lost to mental illness. For a period of about 5 or 6 years, it felt like I was using all the time and energy I had just to stay afloat. I lost touch with the life trajectory I had envisioned, I lost touch with the important people in my life, and I lost touch with my understanding of who I was.<br /><br />In this video I discuss those years and how I've come to process them, learn from them, and move forward.<br /><br />PATREON: <br />Make an impact!
