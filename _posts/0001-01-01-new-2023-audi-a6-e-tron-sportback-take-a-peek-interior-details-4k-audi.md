{% raw %}#Audi #A6 #etron #Sportback #INTERIOR<br /><br />The Audi A6 Avant e-tron  hints at the futurescape of electric range for tomorrow’s production vehicles. <br />Located between the axles, a scalable battery module that can be adapted to the motor requirements forms the heart of this forward-looking solution on which the Audi A6 Avant e-tron concept is also based. Thanks to variable sizing, less powerful models can be equipped with a smaller, lighter battery. What’s more, making use of the entire vehicle base provides a comparatively flat layout for the battery. This is not only essential for vehicles with dynamic architecture but also enables quattro drive. On the exterior, a black inlay highlights the battery housing above the rocker panel that connects the wheel arches.<br />Depending on the drive and model variant, a production version based on the Audi A6 Avant e-tron  could deliver a range of over 700 kilometres (according to the WLTP standard) going forward. The Audi A6 Avant e-tron has an 800-volt system and a charging capacity of up to 270 kilowatts. These promising prospects are possible thanks to the new Premium Platform Electric (PPE). <br /><br />Welcome to the Gold Car Studio channel<br />Enjoy in 4K ULTRA HD  video resolution<br />If you like video, don't forget to subscribe /share/ like / comment ...<br /><br />Time codes:<br />0:00 Exterior (FRONT lights)<br />0:09 Exterior (REAR lights)<br />0:18 Interior <br />1:13 Exterior{% endraw %}
