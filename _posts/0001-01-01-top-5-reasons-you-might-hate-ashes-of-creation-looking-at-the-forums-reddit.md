Our world structure is dynamic and built to react to the actions of our players. Cities will rise and fall, their populations based on the history of the world as the players create it. Quests will unlock as these populations gather, their needs grow, and secrets are unlocked. As the world’s NPC structure is established in real time, players will have the ability to destroy what they’ve created, paving the way for new development, new populations, and real change. Political strife and intrigue will play a very real role in the structure of your world. Gone are the days of static worlds, change is here to stay.<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Chapters:<br />0:00 Intro<br />0:26 Reason #5 No PvE Servers/Can't Toggle PvP Off<br />3:24 Reason #4 Time Sinks<br />5:25 Reason #3 Exclusivity<br />7:05 Reason #2 Consequences of Dying<br />9:03 Reason #1 ???<br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />#AshesofCreation #Top5 #VlhadusGaming{% endraw %}
