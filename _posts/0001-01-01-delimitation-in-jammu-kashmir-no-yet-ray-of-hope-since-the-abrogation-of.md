Now, Jammu will have 6 more seats in J&amp;K Assembly and Kashmir will have 1 more seat and 2 nominated seats for Kashmiri Pandits have been reserved. There has been unrest among the people of Kashmir after the special status of Kashmir was removed by the Narendra Modi government and a full-fledged state was torn into 2 Union Territories i.e. Ladakh and Jammu &amp; Kashmir. In the last District Development Council elections, BJP had hoped to win but the Gupkar Alliance won the DDC Elections and since then Assembly Elections are due.<br /><br />#Delimitation #Kahsmir #Jammu&amp;Kashmir #J&amp;K #Article370 #HindiNews #IndiaNews #BreakingNews #KashmiriPandits #KashmirFiles<br />———————- <br />Please visit our Web Portal for Articles, write-ups, and more... on various serious issues.<br />English- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thepublicindia.com">http://thepublicindia.com</a> Hindi- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://thepublichindi.com">http://thepublichindi.com</a><br /><br />Find us on Social Media<br /><br />Youtube- www.youtube.com/ThePublicIndia<br />Facebook- www.facebook.com/ThePublicIndiaOfficial<br />Twitter- www.twitter.com/ThePublicIndia<br />————————-<br />To conserve unbiased journalism in India, please support The Public India.<br /><br />To donate to us directly through Credit/Debit Card, Wallets, PayPal, or UPI please click on this link- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rzp.io/l/YpFFfUtb">https://rzp.io/l/YpFFfUtb</a><br /><br /> <br />To donate through NEFT/RTGS-<br /><br />Bank Account Name- &quot;The Public&quot;<br />Account Number- 2313392315<br />Bank Name- Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited<br />Branch- Gomti Nagar, Lucknow<br />IFSC- KKBK0005196<br />——————{% endraw %}
