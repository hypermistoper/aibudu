{% raw %}Ray’s team at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging have led research how happiness works. They found that lower expectations make it more likely that an outcome will exceed the expectations and subsequently have a positive impact on happiness.<br /><br />Read more about the research: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0814/040814_happiness_equation">http://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/news-articles/0814/040814_happiness_equation</a><br /><br />Ray Dolan’s research is concerned with a neurobiological characterisation of human emotion and how it interacts with other components of cognition, particularly attention, memory and decision making.  An emphasis in his recent work has been to link brain activity to theoretical models of decision making, particularly models derived from reinforcement learning theory. He is the author of 400 original papers and is ranked as one of the most cited scientists in the world in the field of Neuroscience and Behaviour.<br /><br />Part of the Exchanges at the Frontier event series: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.wellcomecollection.org/exhibitions/exchanges-frontier-2014">http://www.wellcomecollection.org/exhibitions/exchanges-frontier-2014</a><br /><br />Follow us on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://twitter.com/explorewellcome">http://twitter.com/explorewellcome</a><br />Find us on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/wellcomecollection">http://www.facebook.com/wellcomecollection</a>{% endraw %}
