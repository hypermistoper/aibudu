{% raw %}Vinyl Fire shows you the difference between stickers and decals. Stickers are all one solid print and can simply peel and stick. Decals have transfer tape over the design so that more complicated delicate designs can be peeled, applied and then have the transfer tape removed after installation. We also show you our printed and cut stickers.{% endraw %}
