{% raw %}Antiques Roadshow UK S44E10 (03 Apr 2022) - Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh 3<br />#Antiques #AntiquesRoadshow #AR<br />Fiona and the team return to the beautiful grounds of the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh, where finds include a stunning set of traditional Highland dress that once belonged to a clan chieftain and a rare Rolex Sea-Dweller watch. <br /><br />Siobhan Tyrell is thrilled to see a selection of medals awarded to pioneering diver Verrall Newman, including a 1924 Olympic participant’s medal, while Susan Rumfitt hears the poignant story behind a Norwegian bridal brooch. Ronnie Archer Morgan admires a 19th-century bust of a young black man by Scottish sculptor Thomas Stuart Burnett, while Lisa Lloyd appraises a large decorative Suzani textile from central Asia. <br /><br />Alastair Dickenson is intrigued by a silver trophy in the shape of a ram’s head, awarded to the winner of a one-mile bicycle race in 1897 – but what was the curious object’s original purpose? Fiona gets the chance to take a closer look at a plant specimen collected by Charles Darwin during his voyage on HMS Beagle, and Theo Burrell challenges her to put a selection of ceramic piglets by the Wemyss firm in order of value.{% endraw %}
