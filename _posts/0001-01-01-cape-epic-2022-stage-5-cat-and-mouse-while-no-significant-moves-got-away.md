{% raw %}While no significant moves got away, the TOYOTA-NinetyOne-Specialized team of Matt Beers and Christopher Blevins managed to gain time on GC and overtook the Speed Company Racing team for the second position. Beers and Blevins are now 06.55min behind the race leaders with two more racing days. Haley Batten and Sofia Gomez (songo-NinetyOne-Specialized) enjoyed the transition day and found willing allies in the Faces-Rola team. The teams worked together throughout the stage, and ultimately the Specialized duo outsprinted their competition for the win. They now lead by more than 15 minutes overall.{% endraw %}
