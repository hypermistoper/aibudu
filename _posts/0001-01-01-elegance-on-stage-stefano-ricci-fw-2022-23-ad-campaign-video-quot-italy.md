{% raw %}&quot;Italy is a splendidly tailored suit. It is the sum of art, tradition, knowledge, and expertise: it is quality of life in one sentence. And like any sartorial garment, it delights with little secrets and in details that make the difference. For this reason, we continue on a path that sees us committed to the locations of a sustainable Italy, of the absolute Italian spirit. This is naturally relevant for products that are 100% Made in Italy, and, in this context, we were fascinated by the richness of Mantova, the land of the Giants. Virgil, Verdi, Vivaldi, Mantegna, the Gonzaga dynasty, up to Tazio Nuvolari. It is a territory that reminds all of us how much beauty surrounds us.&quot;<br />Filippo Ricci, STEFANO RICCI Creative Director{% endraw %}
