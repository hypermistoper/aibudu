{% raw %}Looking to scale agile in your organization with a heavy focus on scrum? <br />Join me in this video as I introduce you to agile scaling framework Large Scale Scrum (LeSS).<br />LeSS is important especially as it encourages:<br />- whole product instead of “my part.” Take holistic approach, Systems approach and optimize the whole. Local optimization alone would not help!<br />- Global and “end-to-end” product<br /><br />==Abbreviations used <br />PBR = Product Backlog Refinement<br />mPBR = Master PBR<br />PO = Product Owner<br />aPO = Area Product Owner<br />tRT = Team (Sprint) Retrospective<br />tRV = Team (Sprint) Review<br />oRT = Overall Retrospective<br />oRV = Overall Review<br />SP1 = Sprint Planning 1<br />SP2 = Sprint Planning 2<br />FT = Feature Team<br />CT = Component Team<br /><br />===One simple disclaimer..<br />I am using several abbreviations in this video that are not official terms used by LeSS framework<br /><br />I am using these new abbreviations to make it easy for you to understand and visualize the concepts. <br /><br />We also have limited space for the whiteboard to fit in all my awesome illustrations! And abbreviations help us conserve that valuable space<br /><br />Once again, this is not official explanation of LeSS framework.
