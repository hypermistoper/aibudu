In today's video, I'm going to cover why the end of the world's most powerful currency may be coming very soon.<br /><br />The mighty American dollar was once backed by gold, but what a lot of people don't realise is that for a long time it's been backed by oil. Currently, almost all world trade in oil must be done in US dollars, which helps prop up the currency's value.<br /><br />But that may all be coming to an end. As recently, talks between Saudi Arabia and China may start to signal the death of the American dollar. Which could change the world for all of us.<br /><br />Please let me know your thoughts below.<br /><br />LAST WEEK'S VIDEO: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wps0KfUBZCw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wps0KfUBZCw</a><br /><br />0:00 - The US Dollar and oil<br />1:05 - A history of oil and money<br />2:52 - Stabilising the price of oil<br />4:00 - The man who controls oil<br />5:32 - FTX insert<br />6:46 - How the US dollar is losing power<br />8:24 - What this means for you?<br />9:57 - Some final thoughts<br /><br />‚ñ∫ IMPORTANT LINKS:<br />Enter your email below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abundantia.co/">https://www.abundantia.co/</a><br /><br />‚ñ∫ SOCIAL MEDIA:<br />‚Ä¢ Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/">https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/</a><br />‚Ä¢ Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/sorelleamore">https://instagram.com/sorelleamore</a><br />‚Ä¢ Abundantia Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/abundantiaco">https://twitter.com/abundantiaco</a><br />‚Ä¢ Abundantia Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance">http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance</a><br /><br />Sorelle and Leon.<br />Founders, Abundantia<br /><br />Liability Disclaimer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer">https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer</a><br />*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.
