{% raw %}Prime Train / Tom Baulch is back in 2022 playing for the Noosa Tigers in the QAFL competition. The Tigers didn't win a single game last year but with an influx of local and national talent and Prime returning home from the VFL, this year is (hopefully) going to be different!<br /><br />This game was played at Rococo's oval in Noosa. Prime amassed 24 disposals, kicked 4 goals and took 6 marks. Prime played the first mostly through the midfield and then moved to full forward for the second half. <br /><br />If you are interested in training like a professional athlete, check out Prime's programs here; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.primetraining2019.com/">https://www.primetraining2019.com/</a><br />USE CODE: WEEKLYVLOG for 20% off x<br /><br />If you are interested in checking out our new In-Season AFL Program written by Patrick Cripps, Tom Mitchell and Prime, check it out here; <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.primetraining2019.com/collections/personalised-programs/products/personalised-8-week-afl-in-season-gym-program">https://www.primetraining2019.com/collections/personalised-programs/products/personalised-8-week-afl-in-season-gym-program</a> <br /><br />Massive thanks to MIXD MEDIA for shooting the games! <br /><br />Also, a big thankyou to sponsors for this video: <br />Musashi (CODE: PRIME30)<br />Sumo Strength (CODE: BAULCHY5)<br />Manscaped (CODE: PRIMET)<br />EPJournals (CODE: PRIME)<br />Hypnos Reovery (CODE: PRIME10)<br />Tomorrow Skincare (CODE: PRIME)<br />LRF Sport<br />Lululemon <br />Muscle Nation <br />Gymshark<br />Game Bytes <br />Puma <br />Total Compression <br />LUP Labs<br />Modex{% endraw %}
