{% raw %}The Lotus Eletre that you’re looking at here has, on the face of it, as much in common with a Lotus Seven or Elise as a speed-boat has with a cross-channel ferry. It’s a pure-electric SUV, weighs north of 2.2 tonnes, and, can you believe, also happens to be the first Lotus in the company’s 74-year history to have four doors. It’s powered by a 105kWh battery good for 600bhp-plus, promises a WLTP range of 373 miles, and is AI future-proofed in all sorts of ways, including the world’s first deployable LIDAR for level four autonomy. This isn’t a car, it’s a quantum leap. So here’s Top Gear Magazine’s Jack Rix to talk you around it.<br /><br />Subscribe to Top Gear for more videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear">http://bit.ly/SubscribeToTopGear</a><br /><br />MORE ABOUT TOP GEAR:<br />Want to watch a bit of Top Gear on the internet?
