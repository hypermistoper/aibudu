{% raw %}First day - appointment day which actually went well! <br />Second day - wiped out and very unwell<br />Third day - update from appointment and tried to feel better but unfortunately whatever bug I caught really hit me (more to come in the next YT). <br /><br />Lots of hurdles with all of this, but as ever, we kept on going as best we could. <br /><br />#edrecovery #anorexiarecovery #dayinthelife #eatingdisorderrecovery #inpatient #recovery #recovery{% endraw %}
