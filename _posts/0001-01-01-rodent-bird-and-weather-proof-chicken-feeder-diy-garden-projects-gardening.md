{% raw %}Hannah Moloney has devised a smart self-feeding station for her chooks using a recycled plastic tub. <br /><br />As well as keeping her birds entertained, the system is rodent-proof, bird-proof and weather-proof. “The ultimate trifecta!” Hannah says.  <br /><br />What you need: <br /><br />Large food-grade plastic bucket with a handle and a good lid (2-10L is good) <br /><br />A square scrap of untreated timber  <br /><br />An eye bolt (stainless steel or galvanized) <br /><br />A drill with appropriate bits; one matching eye bolt diameter &amp; one slightly larger hole saw or spade bit.  <br /><br />How to do it: <br /><br />Using the hole saw or spade bit, drill a small hole in the bucket base, making sure to remove any loose bits of plastic.  <br /><br />Drill a hole in the timber piece, to attach the bolt.   <br /><br />Thread the bolt through the hole in the bucket, with eye placed inside.   <br /><br />Secure the timber on the end of the bolt, it should hang freely.   <br /><br />Fill the bucket with chicken feed &amp; secure lid.   <br /><br />Using a metal chain or hook, suspend in the chook run at an easy height for the girls to peck the timber.  Its movement in the base of the bucket will allow a few grains of feed to drop.  Your chickens will very quickly get the hang of it! <br /><br />See the latest content from Gardening Australia as it goes live by hitting subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://ab.co/GardeningYouTube">http://ab.co/GardeningYouTube</a> <br />Watch Gardening Australia on ABC iview: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://iview.abc.net.au/programs/gardening-australia">http://iview.abc.net.au/programs/gardening-australia</a> <br /> <br /><br /> <br />About Gardening Australia: <br />Gardening Australia is an ABC TV program providing gardening know-how and inspiration.
