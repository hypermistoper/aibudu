{% raw %}Aaron and Alex traveled to Wheeler Machinery, the largest CAT dealer in Utah to record two Dirt Talk podcasts. One of the podcasts was with the Executive Vice President of Wheeler, Jonathan Campbell. The other was with local contractor Ryan Goodfellow, also known as Rock Structures. We got to tour the facility and see some real neat equipment.
