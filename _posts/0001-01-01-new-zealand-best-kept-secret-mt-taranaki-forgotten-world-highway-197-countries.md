{% raw %}Join us for part 2 of our tour of New Plymouth and the Republic of Whangamomona, New Zealand!<br /><br />We loved the view of Mount Taranaki from our Home Exchange, but imagine living next to an active volcano. These are some brave people!<br /><br />Our first stop was a little agricultural town nearby called Stratford. Back in the day, it was a practice to name newly established towns after the birthplaces of imminent British figures, so Stratford was named after William Shakespeare's hometown. <br /><br />To pay even further respect to the genius British playwright, they named 67 streets after the characters from 27 of Shakespeareâ€™s plays!<br /><br />Today, Stratford is home to the only glockenspiel clock tower in New Zealand. It plays the balcony scene from Romeo and Juliet four times a day and we were lucky enough to be there at the right time to see the 5-minute show.<br /><br />Leaving town, we decided to check out the Carrington Walkway. This 2-mile long loop trail around Stratford was a great way to stretch our legs and discover the surrounding area.<br /><br />Next, we drove up to the Stratford Mountain House for a picnic with the best view of Mount Taranaki.<br /><br />From there we continued on our tour to Hawera, the second-biggest town in the Taranaki region. We quickly noticed the Hawera Water Tower - built because they had three devastating fires. <br /><br />After a quick visit, we decided to jump on the Surf Highway 45 towards New Plymouth and check out some of the nearby beaches and popular surfing spots. <br /><br />The next day, we visited the Puke Ariki (Hill of Chiefs) Museum in New Plymouth which also doubles as a library. <br /><br />Puke Ariki is an interactive museum, free to see and open to 5 pm. We enjoyed diving into New Zealandâ€™s history, nature, geology, inventions, social development, and a whole lot more. <br /><br />While still in the Taranaki area, we couldnâ€™t miss visiting the Republic of Whangamomona. Yes, you read that right! Even though now itâ€™s a tourist place, Whangamomona was founded in 1989. They celebrate the day of the republic on November 1st and even have their own passport stamp!<br /><br />But to get there, we first had to go through the infamous road known as the Forgotten World Highway! The name comes from the fact that there are no gas stations, settlements, or phone signals throughout the 150 km stretch! <br /><br />New Plymouth was such an adventure! <br /><br />If you loved it as much as we did, drop us a comment and let us know your favorite part!<br /><br />0:00 Welcome to New Plymouth New Zealand<br />0:37 View of Mount Taranaki from our Home Exchange <br />1:21 Visiting Stratford In New Zealand <br />1:51 Stratford Clock Tower <br />2:40 Stratford Shakespeare Streets <br />3:22 Glockenspiel Romeo &amp; Juliet Performance <br />4:25 Carrington Walkway Stratford <br />5:51 Stratford Mountain House and Mt Taranaki <br />7:50 Hawera New Zealand <br />8:07 Hawera Water Tower<br />8:19 Surf Highway New Zealand <br />10:42 Puke Ariki Museum New Plymouth <br />14:50 Leaving New Zealand on The Forgotten Highway<br />15:54 Whangamomona - New Zealandâ€™s Secret Country<br /><br />Enjoy the video!<br /><br />#NewPlymouth #NewZealand #Farm<br />______________________________________________________<br /><br />â–º SUBSCRIBE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://growingupwithoutborders.com/subscribe">https://growingupwithoutborders.com/subscribe</a><br /><br />â–º SUPPORT OUR WORK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://growingupwithoutborders.com/partner-with-us/">https://growingupwithoutborders.com/partner-with-us/</a><br /><br />â–º The Girls' New School - CRIMSON GLOBAL ACADEMY: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://growingupwithoutborders.com/CGA">https://growingupwithoutborders.com/CGA</a><br /><br />â–º JOIN OUR ONLINE CLASSES! <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://growingupwithoutborders.com/courses/">https://growingupwithoutborders.com/courses/</a><br /><br />â–º MAP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://growingupwithoutborders.com/video-index/">https://growingupwithoutborders.com/video-index/</a><br /><br />â–º SHOP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://growingupwithoutborders.com/shop/">https://growingupwithoutborders.com/shop/</a><br /><br />â–º WHERE TO STAY<br />* Sign up for Booking.com and youâ€™ll get $25 off your first stay! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://growingupwithoutborders.com/Booking">https://growingupwithoutborders.com/Booking</a> <br />*HOME EXCHANGE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.growingupwithoutborders.com/homeexchange">https://www.growingupwithoutborders.com/homeexchange</a><br /><br />â–º GEAR: <br />Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://growingupwithoutborders.com/Camera">https://growingupwithoutborders.com/Camera</a><br />Phone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://growingupwithoutborders.com/Phone">https://growingupwithoutborders.com/Phone</a><br />Drone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://growingupwithoutborders.com/Drone">https://growingupwithoutborders.com/Drone</a><br /><br />â–º FREE TRIAL OF OUR HOMESCHOOL CURRICULUM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://growingupwithoutborders.com/homeschool">https://growingupwithoutborders.com/homeschool</a><br /><br />â–º THE MUSIC WE USE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://growingupwithoutborders.com/music">http://growingupwithoutborders.com/music</a><br /><br />â–º CONNECT:<br /><br />âœ© BLOG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.GrowingUpWithoutBorders.com">http://www.GrowingUpWithoutBorders.com</a><br />âœ© INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/growingupwithoutborders/">https://www.instagram.com/growingupwithoutborders/</a> <br />âœ© FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/growingupwithoutborders/">https://www.facebook.com/growingupwithoutborders/</a><br />âœ© Tiktok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://growingupwithoutborders.com/Tiktok">https://growingupwithoutborders.com/Tiktok</a><br /> âœ© chantal (at) growingupwithoutborders (dot) com{% endraw %}
