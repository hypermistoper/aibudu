{% raw %}Because of the Atlanticâ€™s strong currents, the ocean carries warmer water towards the coast of Europe, creating a warmer, more misty natural climate and providing a home to a vast amount of wildlife. Starting in the French Pyrenees, through to The Channel Islands, Southwest England, and Western Ireland, this beautiful documentary showcases this unique climate, from snowy mountain ranges to sand dunes, and from Chamois Mountain Goats to Grey Seals. <br /><br />Click here for more documentaries: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2gSPaf6">http://bit.ly/2gSPaf6</a><br /><br />Follow us on Facebook: facebook.com/realwildschannel<br /><br />Follow us on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/realwildchannel/">https://www.instagram.com/realwildchannel/</a><br /><br />Any queries, please contact us at: owned-enquiries@littledotstudios.com<br /><br />#RealWild #Documentary{% endraw %}
