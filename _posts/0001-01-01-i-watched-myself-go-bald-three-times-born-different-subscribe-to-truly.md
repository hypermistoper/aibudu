{% raw %}SUBSCRIBE to Truly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj">http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj</a><br /><br />TAKING BACK control of her identity, Chloe Bean, an influencer from Scottsdale, Arizona, has had the trauma of watching her hair fall out three times after receiving an alopecia diagnosis when she was a little girl. Initially feeling like she had lost her femininity, she stood strong in the face of adversity and now dedicates her time to showing the world that bald is beautiful and losing your hair should never mean losing yourself. The beaming advocate has had her share of negativity due to her lack of locks but it's only made her stronger and now she shares that strength with thousands of followers every day while going one step further in creating and offering products specifically designed for people who have been, are going through or are starting the same journey she has spent her life battling herself. Chloe said: &quot;I posted my very first video of me going bald and the whole process of the bald spots, how it got bigger and bigger. And then my dad shaving my head on TikTok and it received a ton of support. I had so many people reaching out to me saying that they're going through the same thing. I was very surprised when it got that much attention. It went global which allowed me to really pinpoint that I want to do this throughout my lifetime. My passion to help inspire and encourage others will never stop growing.&quot;<br /><br />To follow Chlo's journey, follow here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/chl0ebean/">https://www.instagram.com/chl0ebean/</a><br />To keep up with her TikTok, click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@chl0ebean?lang=en">https://www.tiktok.com/@chl0ebean?lang=en</a><br />To check out her range of products, click here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://baldiebean.com">https://baldiebean.com</a><br /><br />Videographer: Andrew Keil<br />Producers: Dan Coles, Natalia Giorgi<br />Editor: Tani McDowell<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
