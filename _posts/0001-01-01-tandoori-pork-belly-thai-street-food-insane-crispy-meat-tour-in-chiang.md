Today we’re going on a Thai street food tour where we’ll eat some of the crispiest pork belly cooked in a giant earthenware jar - similar to a tandoor oven. Then we’ll eat some more Thai street food including Thai rice and curry, northern Thai rice noodles, and a legendary place for sweet roti. Let’s go eat!<br /><br />Places in this Thai street food tour in Chiang Mai:<br /><br />Neng Earthen Jar Roast Pork เหน่ง ไก่ย่าง หมูกรอบอบโอ่ง ร้านลับ ต้องโดน (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/Q8SxcZJ56PdeNtoHA)">https://goo.gl/maps/Q8SxcZJ56PdeNtoHA)</a> - This is the main spot, on the side of the road you’ll find half a dozen huge ceramic jars, which are used similar to a tandoor. The jar ovens are heated with charcoal on the bottom and all the pork belly and chicken hangs on the sides. The crispy pork belly is insanely tasty, and so crispy. The cooking method allows the meat to cook from the inside out and the skin to fully crispify. Amazing place, highly recommended when you’re in Chiang Mai.<br /><br />Nam Ngiaw Loong Pong น้ำเงี้ยวลุงพงษ์ (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/f7hKxi57Lv8UWhgU6)">https://goo.gl/maps/f7hKxi57Lv8UWhgU6)</a> - Price - 40 THB - Easily one of the most popular and local comfort foods of northern Thailand is nam ngiaw (น้ำเงี้ยว), a porky tomato stew that’s eaten with soft rice noodles. Uncle Pong cooks one pot a day and when it’s gone it’s gone. It’s a traditional taste and a very friendly place.<br /><br />O-Rote Ded โอรสเด็ด (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/bLAKk6VoWFFxP2Wg7)">https://goo.gl/maps/bLAKk6VoWFFxP2Wg7)</a> - Next up on this Thai street food tour we’re going to O-Rote Ded โอรสเด็ด, which is famous for their Thai rice and curry. Everything is ready, you just go up to the front choose what looks good and try it. Make sure you arrive sometime in the morning 8 - 9 am is good to get the best selection.<br /><br />Black Car Coffee (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/8UoXxH8DcHxsHxfr7)">https://goo.gl/maps/8UoXxH8DcHxsHxfr7)</a> - Right across the street, you’ll find P’Anchan who sells amazing coffee out of his old car.<br /><br />Rotee Pa Day (โรตีป้าเด) - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/aiDziA51xgUbABKWA">https://goo.gl/maps/aiDziA51xgUbABKWA</a> - Finally to complete this amazing Thai street food tour in Chiang Mai, we’re going to Rotee Pa Day (โรตีป้าเด), where Aunty Day has been making roti for over 39 years - she’s a legend! One of the things she does differently is use only coconut oil for frying her roti which makes a huge difference. You can taste the cleanness of it. She’s also been recognized in the Thailand Michelin guide.<br /><br />Thank you for watching and hope you have a great time eating Thai food when you’re in Chiang Mai!<br /><br />🎵MUSIC: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/HwVjdo">https://goo.gl/HwVjdo</a><br /><br />——————————————————<br /><br />🍌100% Real Durian Chips - Order Here: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z">http://pixelfy.me/uY4K5z</a><br /><br />👕Get t-shirts and caps:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://migrationology.com/store/">https://migrationology.com/store/</a><br /><br />——————————————————<br /><br />📱FOLLOW:<br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/migrationology">https://instagram.com/migrationology</a>{% endraw %}
