{% raw %}In this video, I use a Cypress component test (see <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://on.cypress.io/component-testing)">https://on.cypress.io/component-testing)</a> to mount a React App component. I do not like the spinning React logo, so I use the &quot;style&quot; option to load additional CSS and apply it to the Logo class, overwriting the animation property. Then I show how to verify that the animation CSS was truly applied (and I can see the logo frozen in the browser).
