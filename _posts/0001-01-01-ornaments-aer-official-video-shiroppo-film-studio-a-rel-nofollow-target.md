The promo of 2011 (s / t) recorded by the same Enrico in the recording studio where he works, which took advantage of Luca Zampriolo's graphics again, took up and developed the most distinctive sound of the band, adding to the renewed emphasis on the treatment of sound, the clear intent to reach more arranged dryness: enveloping live impact and atmosphere.Since the release of the new promo, from September of 2011 to summer 2012, Ornaments resumed treading the stage, promoting their new songs in more than twenty concerts (including the opening act to the only italian gig performed by Pelican and the appearance at Solo Macello Fest, with Napalm Death, Unsane and other big bands).<br />In the summer of 2012, Ornaments decided to start a new studio session to record their long-awaited debut full-length album.<br />&quot;Pneumologic&quot; is configured as a particularly hard-expected record which takes advantage of the experience born from more than 6 years of research in music and live performances.{% endraw %}
