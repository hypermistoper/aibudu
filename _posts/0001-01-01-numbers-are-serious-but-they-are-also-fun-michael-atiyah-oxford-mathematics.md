{% raw %}Oxford Mathematics Public Lectures - Numbers are Serious but they are also Fun - Michael Atiyah<br /><br />Archimedes, who famously jumped out of his bath shouting &quot;Eureka&quot;, also 'invented' the number pi. Euler invented e and had fun with his formula e^(2 pi i) = 1. The world is full of important numbers waiting to be invented. Why not have a go?<br /><br />Michael Atiyah is one of the world's leading mathematicians and a pivotal figure in twentieth and twenty-first century mathematics. His lecture is followed by an interview with Sir John Ball, Sedleian Professor of Natural Philosophy here in Oxford, where Michael talks about his lecture, his work and his life as a mathematician.<br /><br />The Oxford Mathematics Public Lectures are generously supported by XTX Markets.{% endraw %}
