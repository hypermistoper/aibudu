{% raw %}#bushcraft #dugout #buildingadugout<br /><br />Hello everyone from Russia!<br />I love hiking in the forest, so I decided to build my own camp in the forest. Where can I rest from the bustle of the city.<br />I have no experience in construction, but I have a great desire and love for nature.<br /><br />In this series, I made a storage for firewood inside the dugout so that it is always dry and there is no need to go outside. I also insulated the front doors and screwed the handles.<br /><br />Happy viewing!<br /><br />Donate: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://destream.net/live/alekseyvatolin/donate">https://destream.net/live/alekseyvatolin/donate</a><br />Russian instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/vatoshaa/">https://www.instagram.com/vatoshaa/</a>{% endraw %}
