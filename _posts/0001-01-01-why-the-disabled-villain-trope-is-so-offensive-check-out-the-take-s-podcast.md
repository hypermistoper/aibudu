Disabled characters have been portrayed as either innately wicked, turning diabolical in their moment of disfigurement, or generally despising their condition and seeking to harm the able-bodied. The disabled villain trope denies disabled characters any real personhood, and instead turns them into devices to visually contrast with “heroic” characters.<br /><br />If you like this video, subscribe to our channel and support us:<br />Shop our Weird Girl Trope Merch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://the-take.creator-spring.com/">https://the-take.creator-spring.com/</a><br />Join our Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/thetake">https://www.patreon.com/thetake</a><br />TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thisisthetake">https://www.tiktok.com/@thisisthetake</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/ThisIsTheTake">http://instagram.com/ThisIsTheTake</a><br />Podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2eSs6I12WGcAhBfCZ8YpGm?si=8be06c1575594e56">https://open.spotify.com/show/2eSs6I12WGcAhBfCZ8YpGm?si=8be06c1575594e56</a><br /><br />We are The Take (formerly ScreenPrism).{% endraw %}
