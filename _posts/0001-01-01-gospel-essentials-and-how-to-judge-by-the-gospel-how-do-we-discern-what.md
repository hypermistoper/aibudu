{% raw %}How do we discern what is essential to the gospel so as to not compromise? As well as when does a non gospel become a gospel issue? When do we extend the right hand of fellowship and when do we withdraw it? When one compromises And/or tolerates a false gospel, shouldn't such a one be considered an unbeliever? And finally (and more complex) when one makes a certain doctrine, as mentioned above, a gospel issue that others do not, does such a one have a different gospel?{% endraw %}
