{% raw %}I don't know when to start or when to stop<br />My luck's like a button, I can't stop pushing it<br />My head feels light but I'm still in the dark<br />Seems like without tenderness there's something missing<br /><br />Tenderness<br />Where is the<br />Tenderness<br />Where is it?<br /><br />I don't know where I am but I know, I don't like it<br />I open my mouth and out pops something spiteful<br />Words are so cheap, but they can turn out expensive<br />Words like conviction can turn into a sentence<br /><br />I held your hands<br />Rings but none on that finger<br />We danced and danced<br />But I was scared to go much further with it<br /><br />Just half a chance<br />Make sure that one night you're here<br />But next night you're not<br />It always leaves me searching for a little<br /><br />Tenderness<br />Tenderness<br />Tenderness<br />Tenderness<br />Where is the<br />Tenderness?<br /><br />Whistling in the graveyard<br />Calling up your girlfriend<br />Just trying to make her understand<br />You're squeezing the telephone like it was her hand<br /><br />No question<br />(So many questions)<br />She's going to catch you out boy<br />It all seems so underhand<br />Now she's the only thing that ever made you feel like a man, man<br />Madman, madman<br /><br />Where is the<br />Tenderness<br />Little tenderness<br />Where is the<br />Tenderness<br />Little tenderness<br />Where is it?<br /><br />But I held your hands<br />Rings but none on that finger<br />We danced and danced<br />But I was scared to go much further with it<br /><br />Just half a chance<br />Make sure that one night you're here<br />But next night you're not<br />It always leaves me searching for a little<br /><br />Tenderness<br />Tenderness<br />Tenderness<br /><br />Tenderness<br />Tenderness<br />Tenderness<br /><br />When you're sick to death of second best, pet<br />(Tenderness)<br />Why should the morning always find you unimpressed?<br />(Tenderness)<br />Is your love like a button?<br />(Tenderness)<br /><br />You can't stop pushing it?<br />(Tenderness)<br />Oh, this all night longing can be such a long time<br />(Tenderness)<br /><br />Tenderness<br />Tenderness<br />Tenderness{% endraw %}
