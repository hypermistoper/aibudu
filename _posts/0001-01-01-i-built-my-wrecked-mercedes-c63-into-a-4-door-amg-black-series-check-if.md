The hardest part of installing the kit has to be the rear end as its over 70mm wider that original and the rear arches are boded to the body panels leaving no room for error! Along with that i have a bunch more electrical and mechanical problems that i need to fix.<br /><br />‚¨áÔ∏è ALL NEW SAVE THE V8 HOODIES! ‚¨áÔ∏è<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://matarmstrong.co.uk/products/make-the-v8-great-again-oversized-hoodie">https://matarmstrong.co.uk/products/make-the-v8-great-again-oversized-hoodie</a><br /><br />‚¨áÔ∏è ALL MA MERCHANDISE ‚¨áÔ∏è<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://matarmstrong.co.uk/">https://matarmstrong.co.uk/</a><br /><br />‚¨áÔ∏è Follow Me Here Aswell ‚¨áÔ∏è<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/matarmstrongbmx">https://facebook.com/matarmstrongbmx</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/matarmstrongbmx">https://instagram.com/matarmstrongbmx</a>{% endraw %}
