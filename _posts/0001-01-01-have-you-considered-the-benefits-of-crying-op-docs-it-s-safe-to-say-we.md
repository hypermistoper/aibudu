{% raw %}It’s safe to say we all have more to cry about. Gone, for the most part, are the days when shedding tears around other people was derided as inappropriate or embarrassing: Even leaders are crying in public. And that’s OK: Crying can be really, really good for you.<br /><br />And that’s the message that Hidefumi Yoshida, a self-described tears teacher, is out to share. In the short film above, he holds workshops across Japan, where he helps grown-ups learn to cry. Whether it’s breaking the stigma around crying out of grief or simply learning to weep for better mental health, it’s a lesson we all could probably embrace a little more right now.<br /><br />- &quot;Tears Teacher&quot; by Noemie Nakai (<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://noemienakai.com/)">https://noemienakai.com/)</a><br /><br />Read more: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://nyti.ms/2X6KJSp">https://nyti.ms/2X6KJSp</a><br /><br />More from The New York Times Video: <br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n​​">http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n​​</a><br />Watch all of our videos here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://nytimes.com/video​​">http://nytimes.com/video​​</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/nytvideo​​">https://www.facebook.com/nytvideo​​</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/nytvideo​​">https://twitter.com/nytvideo​​</a><br />----------<br />Op-Docs is a forum for short, opinionated documentaries by independent filmmakers.
