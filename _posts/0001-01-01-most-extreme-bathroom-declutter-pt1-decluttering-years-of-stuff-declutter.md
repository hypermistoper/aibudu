{% raw %}#extremedeclutter #declutterwithme #2022declutter #declutter&amp;organize #messtoless #declutteringyearsofstuff<br />Hello everyone and welcome to today's most extreme bathroom declutter, in today's video we are decluttering &amp; organizing my parents' bathroom. This is part 1, so in today's video we will be focusing more on decluttering then cleaning or organizing. Part 2 we have much more organization and cleaning, however, we still have a ways to go with the decluttering process in this bathroom. I am so excited to help my mom declutter areas around her house. She has a lot of stuff, like a lot of stuff. My mom doesn't get rid of anything and she has held onto things for over 30 years! There were items in this bathroom closet that were 30+ years old. I am so excited to help my mom declutter &amp; organize her home. My parents are doing  a lot of updates and remodeling to there home and they're ready to downsize. I am so proud of my mom, she did an amazing job in todays video, we made a lot, a lot of progress. This is going to be a process, we'll have to take baby steps, but we're determined to get it done! This video is jam packed full of decluttering motivation! Thanks for watching and being here with me! Lets do this! xo<br /><br />Also follow me on Instagram @danniraearranged    <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/danniraearranged/">https://www.instagram.com/danniraearranged/</a><br />Music in todays video by Epidemic Sound<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/music/featured/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/music/featured/</a>{% endraw %}
