{% raw %}AMAZING THINGS YOU SHOULD TRY TO HAVE A GOOD TIME ALONE<br /><br /><br /><br />You don’t always need to be around people to have fun. Sometimes, you gotta turn to your creativity and ideas to discover the unlimited things you can do to have fun. In this video, I show you my favorite ones. <br /><br />Take a kitchen sponge and cut it in two small circles, then place it in a balloon and fill it up with glue, now you have your own little anti-stress toy. <br /><br />To give some color to your slime, you can try my relaxing technique where I paint on the slime with a marker and then I mix it up. <br /><br />To make beautiful abstract art, press with a hammer on top of some blobs of paint and see what abstract designs it creates. <br /><br />I also show you some ideas on how to make your own candles. You can use rubber gloves to make a hand-shaped one or eggshells and crayons. <br /><br /><br /><br />Timestamps:  <br /><br />0:42 – DIY relaxing hacks you should try<br /><br />1:43 – DIY hand candle<br /><br />2:59 – Ice-cream candle tutorial<br /><br />4:11 – Clear slime vs rainbow dye<br /><br />6:21 – Oddly satisfying art tutorials<br /><br />7:32 – Beautiful 3d pattern<br /><br />10:16 – The magic cube trick<br /><br />12:04 – Brilliant optical illusion trick <br /><br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
