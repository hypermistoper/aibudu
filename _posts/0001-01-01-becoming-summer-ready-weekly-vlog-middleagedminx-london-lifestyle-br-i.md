{% raw %}#MiddleAgedMinx #London #Lifestyle<br />I am always so jealous of people who in the first days of sunshine, are &quot;summer ready&quot;. De-fuzzed, smooth, tanned, manicured and pedicured. Well, this week I start the process. Thoroughly ashamed of my feet as they resembled hooves. I also went to Claridges to meet up with a very well known influencer who has brought out her own product. I was under no obligation to film her but why wouldn’t I??!! She is a legend! Hope you are looking forward to some sunshine and good luck with the preparations! Many thanks once again for your support.
