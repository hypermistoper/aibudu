{% raw %}RUSTIC FIREPLACE (4K UHD) | Crackling Fire Logs - 8 Hours - Nature Sleep Sounds &amp; Relaxation - ASMR<br /><br />Being in nature, or even viewing scenes of nature, reduces anger, fear, and stress and increases pleasant feelings. Exposure to nature not only makes you feel better emotionally, it contributes to your physical well-being, reducing blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tension, and the production of stress hormones.<br /><br />&quot;I believe in God, only I spell it Nature.&quot; —Frank Lloyd Wright<br /><br />Copyright © 2021 This Is Nature LLC.
