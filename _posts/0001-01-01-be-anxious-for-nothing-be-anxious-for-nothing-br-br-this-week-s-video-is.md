{% raw %}BE ANXIOUS FOR NOTHING!!!<br /><br />This week’s video is a motivational/inspirational one.  A scripture I have known most of my life was brought back to my memory last week as God led me back to the basics to apply it to my life.  Listen in as I share with you what He showed me.  What are you anxious or worried about right now?  I pray that after you tune in, whatever has troubled you will be troubled by your prayers and faith in God!  Be anxious for NOTHING my friends…and I do mean NOTHING!!!<br /><br />Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God; and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are just, whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there is anything praiseworthy—meditate on these things. Philippians 4:6-8 NKJV<br /><br />Follow me on Instagram : LadyAEA<br />Website: LadyAEA.com{% endraw %}
