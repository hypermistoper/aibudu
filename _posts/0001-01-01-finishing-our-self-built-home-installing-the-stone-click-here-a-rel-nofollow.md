It's a week of many ups and downs, including a devastating attack on our farm. <br />Shop Our Apparel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bunkerbranding.com/pages/wild-wonderful-off-grid">https://www.bunkerbranding.com/pages/wild-wonderful-off-grid</a><br /><br />We are a couple who are building our own home from the ground up in the mountains of West Virginia.  After living near the city our entire lives, we finally decided to sell it all, pack up our 3 kids and live in an RV on our 73 acres while building our own debt-free, off-grid house and learning to live a more self-reliant life.<br />As of 2022, we are living inside our A-Frame home. The next phase for us includes building the bedroom wing onto our home while also building investment properties and renovating dilapidated homes.{% endraw %}
