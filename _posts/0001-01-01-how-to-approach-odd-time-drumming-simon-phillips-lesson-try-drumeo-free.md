If you’re thinking in 4/4, the first bar will sound like it’s on the beat, and the second bar will sound like it’s off the beat.<br /><br />To demonstrate, Simon plays and breaks down two classic songs: <br /><br />1. “Dave’s Gone Skiing” by Toto<br />A silly name for a song, maybe, but there’s a good reason for it: the day the band got together to track the song, Toto’s vocalist, David Paich didn’t show up to the studio. When they called around looking for him, all they were told was “Dave’s gone skiing.”<br /><br />“So we cut it with just Luke, Mike and myself,” says Simon. David did eventually lay down piano on the track.<br /><br />You’ll find three time signatures in this tune: 9/8, 7/8, and 4/4.<br /><br />2. “Undeviginti” by Simon Phillips<br />‘Undeviginti’ means ‘nineteen’ in Latin, so it’s a fitting title for a song in which the main phrase is in 19.<br /><br />19/16, in fact.<br /><br />Don’t let those big numbers give you a heart attack. Forget about the bottom number for now, and just focus on counting to 19. You can divide 19 into groups of 2s and 3s to make it more manageable.<br /><br />Pretend you’re playing in 4/4, then after four bars you’ll add three more 16th notes (4*4=16+3=19).<br /><br />Sounds mathy, but it’s much simpler than you might think.<br /><br />(If you want the full song transcriptions, you can find them in the Drumeo members area.

It takes practice to recognize, identify, and play different meters. Simon has been grooving in odd time for years, so while he makes it look easy, it does take time. Keep going!<br /><br />(But in the meantime, if you want to watch Simon rock out in 4/4, here’s his breakdown of “Space Boogie” featuring a legendary double bass drum shuffle: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/zQVaiZsW0eo)">https://youtu.be/zQVaiZsW0eo)</a><br /><br />_______________________________________________________<br />Chapters:<br />00:00 - Introduction<br />00:31 - Overriding<br />02:46 - &quot;Dave's Gone Skiing&quot; Story<br />03:53 - &quot;Dave's Gone Skiing&quot; Performance<br />06:11 - &quot;Dave's Gone Skiing&quot; Analysis<br />07:08 - Counting Complex Time Signatures<br />07:54 - &quot;Undeviginti&quot; Clave &amp; Exercise <br />08:34 - How To Make 19/16 Groove<br />09:12 - &quot;Undeviginti&quot; Performance<br />15:58 - &quot;Undeviginti&quot; Story<br />16:49 - Final Thoughts<br />_______________________________________________________<br /><br />Follow Simon:<br />►Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.simon-phillips.com/">https://www.simon-phillips.com/</a><br />►Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/simonphillipsofficial/">https://www.instagram.com/simonphillipsofficial/</a><br />►Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/SimonPhillipsMusic">https://www.facebook.com/SimonPhillipsMusic</a><br />►YouTube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc3_wIo-8yE_RVE86juf5Ww/featured">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc3_wIo-8yE_RVE86juf5Ww/featured</a><br /><br />Follow us:<br />►The Drumeo Beat: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.drumeo.com/beat/">https://www.drumeo.com/beat/</a><br />►Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/drumeo/">http://facebook.com/drumeo/</a><br />►Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/drumeoofficial/">http://instagram.com/drumeoofficial/</a><br />►TikTok: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@drumeoofficial">https://www.tiktok.com/@drumeoofficial</a><br />_______________________________________________________<br /><br />#oddtime #simonphillips #drumeo{% endraw %}
