{% raw %}I thought you should see phase two of Sellers' home development and what's taken place in the last few months. <br /><br />My main interest in a home is the furniture inside and, for most woodworkers, we want to make our own. In my case, the house needed some updating and, that gave me a blank canvass to design and make for. <br /><br />With the living room completed and with several new designs in place, I am ready for the dining area of the house to begin. With all of the building work done, we now have the backdrop. It's time to start making and, I hope you will enjoy the journey with me.<br /><br />If you want to keep up to date with the projects Paul has been making, visit here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://woodworkingmasterclasses.com/video-library/">https://woodworkingmasterclasses.com/video-library/</a><br />--------------------<br /><br />For more free woodworking videos, please consider subscribing to my channel:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/PaulSellersWoodwork?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/PaulSellersWoodwork?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />Want to learn more about woodworking?<br /><br />Go to Woodworking Masterclasses for weekly project episodes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2JeH3a9">http://bit.ly/2JeH3a9</a><br /><br />Go to Common Woodworking for step-by-step beginner guides and courses: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/35VQV2o">http://bit.ly/35VQV2o</a><br /> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2BXmuei">http://bit.ly/2BXmuei</a> for Paulâ€™s latest ventures on his blog <br /><br />--------------------<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2oWpy7W">http://bit.ly/2oWpy7W</a><br /><br />Facebook- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/2JgKHQS">http://bit.ly/2JgKHQS</a><br /><br />Twitter- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/33S7RFa">http://bit.ly/33S7RFa</a><br /><br />Pinterest- <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/35X5uTf">http://bit.ly/35X5uTf</a>{% endraw %}
