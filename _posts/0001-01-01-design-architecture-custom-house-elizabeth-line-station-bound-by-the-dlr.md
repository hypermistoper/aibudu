{% raw %}Bound by the DLR and ExCeL London on one side, high voltage cables above and Victoria Dock Road to the other side, Custom House #Elizabethline station had to fit into a complex site.<br /> <br />The simple design takes inspiration from a Greek temple, with a long row of columns and beams. Access to the station is via an elevated bridge connecting Victoria Dock Road, the DLR and ExCeL London and the upper-level concourse is deliberately open-sided to give a sense of safety and security. <br /> <br />The station has been designed with a slight angle of 18 degrees, which matches the angle of the existing topography and road network. The columns, ceilings and paving are all parallelograms. <br /> <br />Join Robert Maxwell, Partner at Allies and Morrison to learn more about how the station has been designed and built in a way that combats substantial engineering challenges, producing a simple legible building. <br /> <br />Learn more about the Elizabeth line’s seven design principles, and explore the other new stations between Paddington and Abbey Wood here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZyhXyYkcZ9qL3d8jWSutpL4ots9mG0X1">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZyhXyYkcZ9qL3d8jWSutpL4ots9mG0X1</a>{% endraw %}
