The Pete Gage Blues Trio, presents laid-back standard blues tunes with a #jazz -y tinge, whilst my band, The Pete Gage Band, is characterised by original and powerful renditions of classic blues tunes from the early days of blues music up to the present time. I am a primarily a &quot;live&quot; gigging blues musician, but I also also write songs from hard-driving blues through to soul ballads and even in folk styles. I record all my songs, inviting many of my musical associates to contribute. But I will often play bass guitar, lead &amp; rhythm guitars myself, as well as all manner of keyboards.<br /><br />Whiskey Blues Playlist on Spotify: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shorturl.at/inGMS">https://shorturl.at/inGMS</a><br />Don's Tunes Official Spotify Playlist: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://shorturl.at/dftD2">https://shorturl.at/dftD2</a><br />Don's Tunes on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/dondraperstunes/">https://www.facebook.com/dondraperstunes/</a><br />#Blues &amp; #SlowBlues &amp; Jazz Group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/72sLfA">https://goo.gl/72sLfA</a><br />Don's Tunes on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mr.don.draper/">https://www.instagram.com/mr.don.draper/</a><br />Don's Tunes on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DonsTunes">https://twitter.com/DonsTunes</a>{% endraw %}
