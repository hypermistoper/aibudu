{% raw %}Pot Mutton Biryani<br /><br />This is a traditional Indian dish called Mutton Biryani. It is made with basmati rice, ground lamb or beef and cinnamon, cardamom, cumin seeds, cilantro powder (or leaves), cloves and bay leaves. There are many varieties of mutton biryani. But it's a classic, and it's so easy to make at home! This is a video of Pat Mutton Biryani.<br /><br />The key to making this recipe is patience and boiling for hours on a low flame. You should use mutton cut into small pieces, the bones are added because they add flavor to it. To make the rice fragrant, add garlic, ginger and onion in oil before cooking. We also use a variety of spices such as garam masala, chilli powder and turmeric, which give a unique flavor from other types of biryani.<br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Check our campaign in Patreon page:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/grandpakitchen">https://www.patreon.com/grandpakitchen</a><br /><br />For more details contact : grandpakitchen3@gmail.com<br />facebook :   <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/grandpakitchen/">https://www.facebook.com/grandpakitchen/</a><br />Instagram : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/grandpakitchen.official/">https://www.instagram.com/grandpakitchen.official/</a>{% endraw %}
