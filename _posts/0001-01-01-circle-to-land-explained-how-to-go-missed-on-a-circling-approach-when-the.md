{% raw %}When the runway you want to land on doesn't have a usable approach you may need to do a circle to land. Circling approaches are some of the most difficult tasks you can do as an instrument pilot, so it's important to learn the basics of setting them up, what kind of protections you get from obstacles, and how to go missed from a circling approach, especially if you're already past the missed approach point!<br /><br />Complete your IFR training!
