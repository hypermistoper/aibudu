{% raw %}This is also a BROOCH! Awe inspiring pin by Trifari! Massive! Egyptian Revival from 1973 when designer Andre Boeuf was with Trifari. This is an incredible necklace brooch. The bust of King Tut or an Egyptian pharaoh is depicted for this brooch. The velvet touch finish on the gold-plated metal is highlighted by a silver-tone serpent upon his headdress.<br />I found one on ETSY for $395.00! <br /><br />Please SUBSCRIBE, LIKE, SHARE, AND Hit the BELL so you know when I post new content and when I schedule LIVE jewelry and purse sales!<br /><br />Shop my PURSES here: eBay.com/usr/CostumeJeweler<br /><br />I am The Costume Jeweler!
