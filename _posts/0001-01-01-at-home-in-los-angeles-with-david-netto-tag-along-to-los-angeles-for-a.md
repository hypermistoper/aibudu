{% raw %}Tag along to Los Angeles for a behind the scenes visit with esteemed interior designer and writer David Netto. See how David lives in his iconic Silver Lake house designed by legendary modernist architect Richard Neutra. While David, a Harvard Architecture School drop out, bows reverentially to Neutra’s genius, you’ll see how he, with help from designer friend, the late Paul Fortune, transformed the spartan spaces into a warm and friendly family home for today. Learn how David infused elements of European modernism (including pieces from Arp, Lalanne and Jean-Michel Frank, to name a few) into this quintessential California modernist architecture for a casual and eclectic style. Watch David explain how for Neutra, melding inside and out, including the sound of water, was an essential component of his design, fundamental to his concept of well being in temperate California. And see how David is not afraid to bring color and a few eccentric decorative surprises to his strong architectonic game. With a deep dive of intellectual rigor and a healthy respect for the house’s illustrious position in the annals of design, David manages to bring the past forward with elegance, comfort and distinctive style. You’ll be inspired, informed and entertained!! For more visit quintessenceblog.com{% endraw %}
