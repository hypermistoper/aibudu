{% raw %}The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has survived a vote of no confidence in his leadership but failed to win the backing of a large number of his own members of Parliament.<br /><br />More than 41% of Conservative MPs refused to support him remaining as Prime Minister and voted to declare they had &quot;no confidence&quot; in his leadership. <br /><br />211 Tory MPs supported the Prime Minister while 148 voted against him.<br /><br />The result means Mr Johnson will remain in office but with seriously weakened authority.<br /><br />Huw Edwards presents BBC News at Ten reporting by political editor Chris Mason.<br /><br />Please subscribe HERE <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/1rbfUog">http://bit.ly/1rbfUog</a><br /><br />#BBCNews{% endraw %}
