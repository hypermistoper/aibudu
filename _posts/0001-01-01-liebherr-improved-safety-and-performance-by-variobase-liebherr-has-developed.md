{% raw %}Liebherr has developed a unique system with which every individual crane support can be extended to any length and the crane operation is then made safe by the load moment limiter within the LICCON control – this system is called VarioBase®. <br /><br />This means that for the first time it is possible to work safely with any support base in constricted conditions.<br /><br />The Variable Supporting Base ensures higher lifting capacities and a larger working range, even with a maximum support base.<br /><br />This video was taken in compliance with the locally applicable Corona guidelines.{% endraw %}
