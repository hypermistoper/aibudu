{% raw %}An easy way to do the washing up after making cold process soap no oily utensils, no oil slick in your water, and no oil down your drains. <br /><br />In the video I talk about using microfibre cloths, they are fantastic for this clean up job, we use microfibre in many clothes and cloths nowadays, did you know when you wash them they release microparticles? (you know all those floating plastic things we are trying to eliminate from our oceans). I always wash all of my microfibre items in a special washing bag that catches these fibres and prevents them from getting into the waterways. If you'd like to find out more have a look here, these are the bags I use <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.guppyfriend.com/">https://en.guppyfriend.com/</a><br /><br />I find this the easiest way to clean up after cold process soap making and also a very effective way to prevent oils from going down your drain and causing all sorts of problems in your drainage system.<br /><br />I know it's not a very exciting topic, but it is a question I see asked a lot on some soapy forums that I'm a member of, so hopefully, you might find it useful especially if you're fed up of that oils mess you create when you wash up your soap equipment.<br /><br />I try to give lots of hints and tips in all of my videos, so hopefully, you can use some of the techniques in this cold process soap making tutorial in your own soap making. <br />I hope you enjoy the video.

The information given is based on what works for me, however, there are lots of variables associated with cold process soap making and I, therefore, take no responsibility for the results achieved when using the techniques or methods explained in these tutorials. Cold process soap involves the necessary use of sodium Hydroxide (lye) which is a very dangerous substance. Before attempting and cold process soap making you should ensure you are fully aware of the lye safety procedures and always wear the correct safety equipment when making soap.{% endraw %}
