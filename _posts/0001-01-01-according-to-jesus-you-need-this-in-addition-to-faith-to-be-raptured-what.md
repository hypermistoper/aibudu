{% raw %}What’s required in order to be raptured? Just faith in Jesus? Well, maybe not. In the Book of Revelation, Jesus himself placed a condition on what it takes to be raptured. And this statement about this trait being necessary isn’t hidden in some obscure passage. It is found in one of the most famous rapture passages in the Bible, Rev 3:10. That's because being raptured and being saved are two different things. Watch this MOST IMPORTANT Nelson Walters video to discover what that difference is, what trait we need to be raptured, and what this says about Rev 3:10.{% endraw %}
