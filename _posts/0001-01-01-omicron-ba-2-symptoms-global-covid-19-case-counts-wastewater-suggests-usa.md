{% raw %}Agenda:<br />(1) Global COVID-19 Case Counts. European And Asian Cases Spiking.<br />(2) Sewage In The United States Worrisome For Future Case Surge<br />(3) Review Of Omicron BA.2 Symptoms And Ability To Differentiate BA.1 From BA.2?<br /><br />COVID-19 cases continue to surge in many European and Asian countries, including Germany, France, Finland, Austria, United Kingdom, South Korea, China, and more.<br /><br />United States case counts remain low, but wastewater surveillance systems that have been highly predictive of cases to come have started to show an increase in wastewater and sewage SARS-COV-2 RNA. This indicates that we may be experiencing an increase in cases in the coming week or weeks in the United States as well, similar to our European and Asian neighbors.<br /><br />Lastly, we dive into whether you should be expecting different symptoms with BA.2 than you did with BA.1 and if there is any way to differentiate whether you have BA.2 or BA.1 (or any other Omicron subvariant for that matter).<br /><br />Learn more about Omicron in the videos below!<br />Omicron - BA.2 Variant Becoming Dominant?
