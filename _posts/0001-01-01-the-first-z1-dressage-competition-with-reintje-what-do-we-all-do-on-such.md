{% raw %}Due to covid we couldn't ride a dressage competition for a long time. A year ago we ran M1 and M2 (second level) competitions online. Now it's time to start Z1. (third level) Reintje has not often been to a competition location. This is all still very new to her. We are going to see what such a competition day looks like.
