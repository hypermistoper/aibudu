{% raw %}I want to take the time to show you guys what it has been like for me to work from home the past year. Aside from vlogging and making new videos on Tik Tok, I work full time as a Procurement Specialist or others call it a Buyer. I basically shop for my engineers and find the parts that they need to finish their build. How you guys enjoy this video!<br /><br />If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to comment away.{% endraw %}
