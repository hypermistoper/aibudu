{% raw %}What better time to release this video than now... My first stand-up video on Patriotism &amp; Governance. <br /><br />Loving your country means asking a lot of questions. Asking for peace, asking for better living conditions, asking for your right to voice your opinion if the taxes you're paying are not leading to the life you ideally want to live. Thank you for watching. A video will follow every week for the next four weeks. <br /><br /><br /><br />Venue: - Tuning Fork, Mumbai.<br /><br />Shot by: - Nishant Tharwani (Tuning Fork Studios)<br /><br />Edited by: - Suraj Jagtap (After Studios) <br /><br />Sound recording mixing mastering: - Sohaill Gandhi (Tuning Fork Studios) <br /><br />Music: - Dub Sharma <br /><br />Link to full track - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NJbxEgf3Uo">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6NJbxEgf3Uo</a> <br /><br />Special Thanks: - Varun Grover &amp; Anuvab Pal{% endraw %}
