{% raw %}At 27 years old and 30 stone, Joy Vaughan is morbidly obese. Despite numerous repeated attempts, Joy just cannot lose weight. She works long irregular hours and often eats the wrong kinds of food. Her bad relationship with food stems from the loss of her grandfather when she was 12 years old. She took his death very badly and began comfort eating. Can surgery offer her the life she so desperately wants?<br />In this episode, we also revisit former lorry driver, Jeff O'Shea who has lost 17 stone in one year since his gastric bypass operation. He has a wife and a young family, who have all benefited massively from Jeff's weight loss. We see the physical, psychological, and emotional benefits the whole family has experienced as a result of the surgery.<br /><br />Fat Doctor goes on a remarkable journey following the patients of three of Britain’s most sought after weight loss surgeons. It focuses on the obese patients who undergo the operations and discovers why they became obese and the impact life changing and often life saving weight loss surgery has on their lives. We find out what their lives are like now and how this has affected their physical, social and psychological lives. <br /><br />Like our content?
