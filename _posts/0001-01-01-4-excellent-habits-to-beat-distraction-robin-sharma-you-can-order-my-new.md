How the pros construct creative sanctuaries to protect their attention and fortify their focus so they do their best work. <br /> <br />2. The &quot;No Phone Conversation&quot; protocol to amplify your listening so people not only trust you more but rise when they are with you. <br /> <br />3. How the construct your personal &quot;Menlo Park&quot; so that you leverage the neural biological phenomenon of Transient Hypofrontality to step into your primal genius. <br /> <br />4. The value of joining The 5AM Club and calibrating your morning routine so that digital distraction is a non-issue as you move through your day. <br /> <br />Go ahead and watch this valuable episode and share it with a friend if you find it helpful. <br /><br />I really hope this helps you accelerate your creativity and fortify your productivity so you bring your fire to a world that needs us playing at our best.
