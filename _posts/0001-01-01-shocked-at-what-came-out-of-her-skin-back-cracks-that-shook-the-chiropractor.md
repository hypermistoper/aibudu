{% raw %}Try thinking about cracking a patient's joints from the chiropractor's point of view...many chiropractors graduate with only having performed several hundreds of adjustments...this may sound like a lot,  but it isn't! IMO it takes thousands of adjustments to perfect the art which comes AFTER graduating. This is a critical moment in a chiropractor's career and when there is usually a  internal debate about even joining the workforce as one! Just keeping it honest. So if I seem surprised or shocked at how a joint decides to move under the force that I am applying, it is a genuine reaction from myself and the patient. For me, it never gets old the joy from the patient at the relief they feel and my satisfaction at a job well done.  <br /><br />Support the channel with a membership! <br />Membership link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw2rs0uJqzN0ZzfmfkQ03pQ/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw2rs0uJqzN0ZzfmfkQ03pQ/join</a><br /><br />Instagram: @chiro_dragon<br /><br />DISCLAIMER: Content posted contains generalized statements based on medical knowledge/product usage does not and is not intended to offer medical advice, diagnosis, or act as a prescriber of treatment.
