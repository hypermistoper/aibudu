{% raw %}One of the most controversial design elements of the iPhone is its lack of a back button. Something thatâ€™s standard on most Android devices. The idea is that a button to go back to the previous screen allows users to easily navigate their device. But Apple disagreed. And the story behind that decision dates back to 2007, when the original iPhone was under development.{% endraw %}
