{% raw %}GT Communications Executive Director Gemma Tognini says considering gender in emergency rescue scenarios is a “nonsense, complicating factor”.<br /><br />The Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience released its emergency management journal, which includes articles on gender equality and justice in disaster and emergency management.<br /><br />“I think it’s a space where that kind of discussion just doesn’t fit,&quot; she said. <br /><br />“You rescue people and just as you pay no heed to their religion or the colour of their skin or their belief system …  it doesn’t matter, you simply rescue the person,” she told Sky News host Chris Kenny.{% endraw %}
