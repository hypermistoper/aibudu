{% raw %}Here are my favourite ways to wear a headband. You can see the fun upbeat version to music over on Instagram @silver_styling. Be sure to go to the follow along over there for bite sized content if you’re not already.<br /><br />I used all these looks when I transitioned to grey hair and I thought the weekend was a great time to get the headbands and scarves out. I purchased the scarves from Amazon. Oliver Bonas often have head scarves in nice colours too.<br />.<br />.<br />Anything that takes the attention away from the growth line is helpful in my opinion in the early days of transitioning to grey. <br /><br />When you’ve grown out your hair, headbands give your outfit a lift with colour and show off your personality. <br /><br />Let me know what you think of these styles and tell me your favourite.<br /><br />Have a fabulous weekend.{% endraw %}
