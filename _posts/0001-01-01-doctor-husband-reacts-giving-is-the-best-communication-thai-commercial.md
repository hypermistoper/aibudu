{% raw %}Someone requested my husband to watch this thai commercial that led them to pursue medicine.<br /><br />this is def a good one.<br />i saw it a couple of years ago but forgot about it and the details i didnt pay attention to until now. i cant remember if i cried in the past (im sure i did) but def teared up now!<br /><br />As a nurse I have to say my heart has a passion for helping and caring for others. I know my husband went into medicine and became a doctor because of a similar heart and drive to cure people's illnesses. We BOTH experience extreme burnout and compassion fatigue, but i feel like his stress is a lot more than mine when it comes to medicine. This commercial definitely helped remind him about the good things in being a doctor (because right now he's sooooo burned out he sometimes regrets the life in medicine). <br /><br />moral of the story is definitely to always be kind and giving. <br />pay it forward.<br />you never know the difference you're making. <br />that one moment of grace or mercy can affect so many lives. <br />so always be kind.{% endraw %}
