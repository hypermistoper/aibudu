{% raw %}On December 21, 2021, I was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer. My treatment plan begins with 8 rounds of chemo. This is my first week of treatment.

It all begins with 8 rounds of chemotherapy. I will receive bi-weekly infusions which (if all goes according to plan) will bring us into May of 2022. Our hope is that the chemotherapy will attack all of the cancer cells that remain in my right breast and kill any little cancerous cells that may have metastasized throughout my body. Unfortunately, there is no real way to detect how well my body is responding to the treatment as I go through it but I will continue to meditate and focus my energy on healing. <br /><br />I want to take a second to thank you all again for being on this journey with us. We can genuinely feel the love we are receiving worldwide and know that it is a crucial part of our healing.
