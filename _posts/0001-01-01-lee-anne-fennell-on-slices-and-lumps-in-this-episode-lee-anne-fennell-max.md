{% raw %}In this episode, Lee Anne Fennell, Max Pam Professor of Law at the University of Chicago Law School, discusses her new book, &quot;Slices and Lumps: Division and Aggregation in Law and Life,&quot; which is published by the University of Chicago Press. She begins by explaining what she means by &quot;lumps&quot; and &quot;slices,&quot; and why they are concepts that structure the way we think about the world. She observes that aggregating &quot;lumps&quot; together into valuable goods and disaggregating &quot;slices&quot; of goods into valuable segments often increases welfare, but is difficult to accomplish. She explains how this phenomenon affects our decisionmaking, not only in relation to property, but also intrapersonal choices about our lives.This episode was hosted by&amp;nbsp;Brian L. Frye, Spears-Gilbert Associate Professor of Law at the University of Kentucky College of Law. Frye is on Twitter at&amp;nbsp;@brianlfrye.{% endraw %}
