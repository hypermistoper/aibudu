{% raw %}Do you want your kids to learn basic math? How about introducing the difference between  above and below positional words while having fun? Sounds like hitting two birds in one stone if you let them watch Juggling Mommy's new video. This video will give them a brief idea on what above and below mean and when to best use them. We have even used kid friendly examples, colourful enough to keep their attention up until the end of this short video. <br /><br />This may seem like a simple concept, but I remember struggling with these two when I was a little girl. Hopefully, children of all ages, probably as early as 2 years old can watch this so they can start putting it into practice while they develop their growing vocabulary. <br /><br />Watch and have fun!<br /><br />#nursery #preschool #montessori #homelearning #homeschool #educationalvideo #toddlermilestone #babymilestone #brainybaby #positionalword #earlymath #math101 #babymath #toddlermath{% endraw %}
