It's often heard that you can live in the Philippines for as low as $800 per month, but in this video we dispel any falsehoods about the Philippine budget topic. <br /><br />So whether you're planning on retiring in the Philippines, settling down, or you're curious about how far you can stretch your budget, this video should give you a deeper understanding of budget ranges and what type of lifestyle can be afforded according to your retirement. <br /><br />Everything from the minimum budget you should have when moving here, the best budget range to stick to, and how much is enough is discussed in this video.
