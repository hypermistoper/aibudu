{% raw %}ELM013 - The Dust<br />by enliven dOP acoustics<br /><br />This new outstanding Enliven Music release, called THE DUST, is a cooperation of the three french whizz kids dOP and Enliven Deep Acoustics. They were throwing the old method of Original+Remix overboard and were developing two completly independent tracks which share the same underlying theme. The dOP interpretation comes with a chorus which spins a web of harmony around the listener, the rest of the track is pure groove which leaves no quiet legs, the cherry on the cake is the charming and very sexy vocal by jonathan. The Enliven Deep Acoustics version transports a unique atmosphere by a proper portion of funk. Like a diamond on the ring...<br /><br />OUT NOW on 12inch at your favourite dealer<br />OUT SOON digital at november 5th<br /><br /><br />Played and supported by:<br /><br />agoria : full support !! love love love !!<br />mathias kaden : wow....so much emotional songs....really great music for the future!!!<br />sis : nice mix dop;)<br />anthony collins : superb ep<br />boris werner : loving both traxx, my fav is the enliven mix, wicked vocal!!<br />alland byallo : I love this!
