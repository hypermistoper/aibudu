The event will be played over three courses, La Quinta CC, The Nicklaus Tournament Course and the Stadium Course on PGA West, with reigning champion, Si Woo Kim looking to add to his three victories on the PGA TOUR. Patrick Cantlay will return to La Quinta, buoyed by his final round at The American Express last year, which saw him shoot a course-record 61, but ultimately fall short of the South Korean. World No. 1, Jon Rahm will be returning to the event for the first time since 2019, hoping to repeat his heroics a year prior that saw him lift the trophy. However he’ll have to battle past a strong field that includes major winners, Justin Rose, Phil Mickleson and Patrick Reed.<br /><br /><br /><br />Welcome to the official YouTube channel of the PGA TOUR.
