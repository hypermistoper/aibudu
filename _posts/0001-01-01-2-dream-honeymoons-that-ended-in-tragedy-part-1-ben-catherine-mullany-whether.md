{% raw %}Whether things go completely according to plan or end up a hectic mess, it’s often said that your wedding day goes by so quickly that the whole thing can feel like a blur. In fact, with so many preparations and things to keep track of, the day can easily become more work than celebration for the people actually getting married. <br /><br />By contrast, the honeymoon is supposed to be the complete opposite — a time for newlyweds to relax and enjoy themselves, and have their first memorable moments as a married couple.
