Every one of his American exhibitions was sold out on opening night and attended by thousands of enthusiastic fans. This book will be his first monograph and will cover his entire career, with particular focus on his most iconic alternative movie posters (including Jaws, The Birds, Vertigo, and The Master).<br /><br />The book includes a 6-page section of rejected and unpublished poster art and a foreword by filmmaker and Durieux collector Francis Ford Coppola.{% endraw %}
