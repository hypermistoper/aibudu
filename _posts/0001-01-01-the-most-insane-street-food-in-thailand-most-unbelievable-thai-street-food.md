Here’s a map link: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/EVKBg2ws46t">https://goo.gl/maps/EVKBg2ws46t</a><br /><br />By the way, this is Part 2 of this Night Market Thai street food tour. You can watch the gigantic tom yum challenge here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/4eZbr5qDxio">https://youtu.be/4eZbr5qDxio</a><br /><br />The market is known for its unique Thai street food, some of the snacks and dishes which are invented there and you won’t find anywhere else in Bangkok.<br /><br />Laeng Saeb (เล้งแซ่บ) at Diaw Maekhlong Restaurant (ร้านเตี๋ยวแม่กลอง) - Laeng saeb, a dish of pork bones and ridiculous amounts of green chilies is one of the most popular Thai street food inventions at Talad Rot Fai, and this is mainly what I came to eat. The restaurant is located at the back of the market, and they have a few different sizes you can choose from.<br /><br />XXL Laeng Saeb (เล้งแซ่บ) - Price - 599 THB ($18.96) - We went straight for the XXL size, a massive platter of pork bones, soup, insane amounts of green chilies and the soup broth. Of all the Thai street food I’ve eaten, this is one of the most unbelievable and insanely giant street foods of Thailand I’ve ever seen or eaten. Although it’s way more than I ever care to eat again in one sitting, it’s actually a really good dish.<br /><br />Crispy butter (เนยกรอบ) - 35 THB ($1.11)<br />Stir fried ice cream (ไอติมผัด) - 69 THB ($2.18)<br />Coconut shake (น้ำมะพร้าวปั่น) - 35 THB ($1.11)<br /><br />And that completed this Thai street food night market tour of Talad Rot Fai. It’s well worth a visit, and you can of course, order smaller sizes of laeng saeb when you’re in Bangkok.
