In this video, I'm uncovering one of the least well known things in the global tax evasion scene: how fine art is used by people to evade taxes.<br /><br />You might think that whenever you hear of some painting selling for a ridiculous amount of money, that it's just a collector wanting to buy something nice for their wall. And yes, sometimes it is... but sometimes, it's an elaborate scheme used to dodge taxes in a big way.<br /><br />Fine art has been used for a long time to manipulate the way the ultra-rich pay tax, hide their money, as well as even launder cash. And hopefully, I'm going to reveal a little of that to you in this video.<br /><br />I'd love to hear your thoughts below!<br /><br />0:00 - One of the most manipulated industries on Earth<br />0:31 - A quick disclaimer<br />1:27 - How art is used to evade taxes<br />2:02 - Find yourself an artist<br />2:43 - Promote the artist<br />3:58 - Skillshare insert<br />4:58 - Appraising your new art<br />5:57 - Donate your art for a tax break<br />7:03 - The big club of the art world<br />8:37 - How freeports are used to evade tax<br />10:26 - Final thoughts<br /><br />► IMPORTANT LINKS:<br />Enter your email below for free weekly lessons and insights into becoming financially free, investing, global tax and corporate structures, passports, residencies, and more.<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abundantia.co/">https://www.abundantia.co/</a><br /><br />► SOCIAL MEDIA:<br />• Abundantia Instagram: @abundantia.co <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/">https://www.instagram.com/abundantia.co/</a><br />• Sorelle's Instagram: @sorelleamore  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/sorelleamore">https://instagram.com/sorelleamore</a><br />• Abundantia Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/abundantiaco">https://twitter.com/abundantiaco</a><br />• Abundantia Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance">http://facebook.com/abundantiafinance</a><br /><br />Sorelle and Leon.<br />Founders, Abundantia<br /><br />Liability Disclaimer: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer">https://www.abundantia.co/disclaimer</a><br />*We may earn a commission if you buy any products or services via the links in this video's description.
