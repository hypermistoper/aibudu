{% raw %}So I Attempted An Even CRAZIER Split... BTD6 / Bloons TD 6. Previously, I attempted a co-op circle split on Ravine which was pretty tough, but what about sanctuary? This split involves moving platforms so on some rounds you're completely unable to place new towers! I give it a go here on hard difficulty.<br /><br />This is my series of Bloons TD 6 strategy, gameplay, challenges, or whatever else it may be.
