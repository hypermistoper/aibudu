{% raw %}17 year old Irish traveller Roseanne became what's known as a Runaway Bride, when she deliberately spent time alone with her boyfriend as a way of forcing her parents to bring her marriage forward by a year and a half.<br /><br />It was a strategy not without its risks, as many traveller girls runaway with their boyfriends only to find themselves dumped and scandalised meaning no other boy will go near them. Something that happens regularly in gypsy culture. <br /><br />In order to avoid a scandal, tarnishing the family name and risking forever being branded as ‘dirty’, Roseanne’s wedding was fast tracked. But was it all worth it? <br /><br />00:06 – Traveller Rules of Courtship<br />00:31 – The Scandal<br />00:49 – Why Roseanne is engaged at 17<br />02:15 – The Last Chaperoned Date<br /><br />03:45 – Dress Fitting<br />05:24 – Hair and Make-Up<br />06:42 – Getting the Dress on<br />07:30 – How does her mum feel?<br />07:53 – Arriving at the Church<br />08:31 – Boys will be boys <br />08:59 – The Reception<br />09:11 – First Dance <br />09:27 – How does the Bride feel?<br /><br />Content licensed from Firecracker Films.
