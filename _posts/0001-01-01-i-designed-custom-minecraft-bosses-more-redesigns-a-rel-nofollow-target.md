I ended up making a creeper/chameleon mech and a cursed enderman they turned out really good! The dude perfect playbutton is seriously almost done and I can't wait to show it to you<br /><br />//about<br />My name's daniel and I design things. Usually I do 3d modeling in blender but I'm now a metal worker thanks to mr beast apparently??? Who knows what I'll design in the future. If you have any ideas please let me know{% endraw %}
