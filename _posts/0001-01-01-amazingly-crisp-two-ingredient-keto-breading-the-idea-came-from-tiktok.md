{% raw %}This video started with the idea of trying out a TikTok keto recipe for cheddar pickle chips and wound up with me creating the best keto breading I've ever had.  The amazing thing is that this breading has only TWO ingredients and only 2g of TOTAL carbs per 3/4 cups (90g).  The magic happens by combining these two ingredients into a food processor.  When air fried, it turns into something that looks and feels like it's been batter fried rather than breaded.<br /><br />I won't make a printable recipe for this because it's just so simple.<br />In a food processor, combine:<br />- 1 cup loosely packed sharp cheddar (60g)<br />- 1/3 cup loosely packed pork rind panko (30g)<br /><br />That's it!  The yield winds up being about 3/4 cup of breading (90g) with the following macros for an entire batch:<br />Total carbs - 2g<br />Protein - 33g<br />Fat - 31g<br />416 calories<br /><br />If you do a tray of 12 pickle chips, macros per chip are:<br />Total carbs - .67g<br />Protein - 5g<br />Fat - 5g<br />71 calories<br /><br />Products used in this video:<br />Mini food processor: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3vW0iyo">https://amzn.to/3vW0iyo</a><br />14 cup food processor: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3vVSvRe">https://amzn.to/3vVSvRe</a><br />EverCrisp: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3pUUMZ3">https://amzn.to/3pUUMZ3</a><br /><br />Timestamps:<br />0:00 Intro<br />0:54 TikTok pickle chips<br />3:07 Improved pickle chips<br />7:33 Chicken tenders with keto breading<br /><br />üè™ Serious Keto Amazon Store (where you can find the tools and ingredients I use): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/shop/seriousketo">https://www.amazon.com/shop/seriousketo</a><br /><br />üë®‚Äçüç≥You can contribute to SeriousKeto's recipe test lab and enjoy some &quot;behind-the-scenes&quot; perks by becoming a channel member: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCecoI0NlmzY8H8NlP6v3YRg/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCecoI0NlmzY8H8NlP6v3YRg/join</a><br /><br />-<br />üëï Get SeriousKeto merchandise: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/seriousketo-merch">https://teespring.com/stores/seriousketo-merch</a><br />üì∑ Follow SeriousKeto on Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/seriousketo/">https://www.instagram.com/seriousketo/</a><br />üë®üèª Follow SeriousKeto on Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/seriousketocooking/">https://www.facebook.com/seriousketocooking/</a><br />-<br /><br />SeriousKeto is a participant in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.
