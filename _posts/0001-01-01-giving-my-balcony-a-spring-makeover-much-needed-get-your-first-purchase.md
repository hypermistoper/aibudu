I recreate hairstyles from movies, tv shows or history and have regularly come up with my own, which I love to share with you!<br /><br />I really enjoy diving into history to find out how women went about their beauty and dressing rituals in days past. Vintage and history-themed videos are my joy, as is my latest passion: sewing and costuming.<br /><br />You'll find a bit of lifestyle content here as well, ranging from cozy chats over a cup of tea (my beloved Tea Time videos) to personal vlogs and slow &amp; conscious living videos. <br /><br />Enjoy browsing!<br /><br />Love,<br />Lucy<br /><br />-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.loepsie.com">http://www.loepsie.com</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://instagram.com/Loepsies">http://instagram.com/Loepsies</a>{% endraw %}
