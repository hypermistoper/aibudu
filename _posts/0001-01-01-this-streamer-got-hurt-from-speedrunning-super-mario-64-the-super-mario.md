Mario 64 speedrunning is fun and epic, especially when the Super Mario 64 world record is being thrown around. Simply's march mario madness is coming up, very fun and real. This video isn't a super mario 64 speedrunner trying out SM64 on Nintendo DS. It isn't a riven montage either.  This is a speedrun competition between two speedrunners to compete for the big prize. HOPE YOU ENJOY!<br /><br />#mario #speedrun #boxbox{% endraw %}
