{% raw %}In this video, we discuss LEAP options and the rolling LEAP strategy. Intended to generate higher returns by substituting risk with leverage. IF we take a look at LEAPS in more detail we can see that given a rise in the SP500 a leap will offer higher returns, compared just holding an individual ETF. Double even triple the returns of a normal buy and hold investor. The exact numbers are hard to predict given when you roll your investment but overall you can expect that this leveraged strategy will without a doubt offer much higher returns than holding the SPY if past history is any indication of the future returns of America's largest companies. This can serve as a great long term strategy for buy and hold investors who are looking to extend their gains. Even Warren Buffet has a hard time arguing against LEAPS for normal everyday investors. They offer more leverage without the need of offering up more borrowed money.{% endraw %}
