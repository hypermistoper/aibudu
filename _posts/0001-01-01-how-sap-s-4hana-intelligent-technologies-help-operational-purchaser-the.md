{% raw %}The value of Artificial Intelligence Technologies in the Intelligent Enterprise is not really just about technology.  It is also not about a particular tool or capability such as Machine Learning, Robotic Process Automation bots or anything else.  The value of AI Technology lies in your ability to actually use this technology to create tangible innovative and time-saving solutions to solve complicated business problems.<br /><br />You do this by taking an end-to-end business process view of the problem and then driving your solution to a defined business outcome. You can create a hundred cool bots, or algorithms or skills â€“ but if they do not somehow or another converge upon a specific business process, and comprehensively address a true end-to-end business solution, they will all remain really cool solutions that sit on a shelf.<br /><br />The demo illustrate this with an example of an Operational Purchaser.{% endraw %}
