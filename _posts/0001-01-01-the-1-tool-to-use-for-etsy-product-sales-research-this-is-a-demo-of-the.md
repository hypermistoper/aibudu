{% raw %}This is a demo of the amazing keyword tool in Alura.  I use Alura to see what kind of demand there is for what I'm about to sell on Etsy.  You can see traffic and sales for specific keywords in Alura.  This tells me if I should or shouldn't sell specific products.  The higher the traffic and sales for related keywords, the higher the chance that my similar product will sell as well.  This is just one of the many cool features Alura has to help your Etsy business.  <br />Get your free trial of Alura here:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.alura.io/?via=LLETSY">https://www.alura.io/?via=LLETSY</a>{% endraw %}
