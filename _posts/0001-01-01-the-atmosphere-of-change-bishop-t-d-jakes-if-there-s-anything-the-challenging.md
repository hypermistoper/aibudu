{% raw %}If there's anything the challenging chapter of 2020 taught us, it's that God isn't here for our entertainment; He's here to change us! And sometimes, He has to take us the long way around so that we can redefine ourselves under a Kingdom mentality. Why have you been asking God to change your life yet ignore Him when He tries to change you? Here's the thing: If God can transform you, YOU can change your situation. Did you get that? God is dropping you into a wonderful atmosphere of change now where anything can happen ‚Äî but you cannot entertain your old ways! If there‚Äôs one thing that you glean from 2020, understand that transformation blossoms in the place where confirmation and consecration meet. Here‚Äôs to a new you! <br /><br />Message: ‚ÄúThe Atmosphere of Change!‚Äù <br />Scripture: 1 Samuel 10:1-7 (NIV) <br />Speaker: Bishop T.D.
