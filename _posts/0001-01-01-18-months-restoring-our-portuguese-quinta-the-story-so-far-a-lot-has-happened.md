{% raw %}A lot has happened over the last 18 months here on our small quinta in Central Portugal. From clearing the land to starting a small veg garden to renovating the farmhouse.<br /><br />Of course, the story of this place goes back much further than 18 months. Before we bought it in October 2020 no one had lived here for almost 20 years. <br /><br />In this video we’ll travel back in time and give you a brief history of the house and the family that built it as well as showing you what we’ve accomplished in the short time that we’ve called this place home.{% endraw %}
