One night, he decides to check out the spectacular Kilauea Volcano, driving down a secluded local road, before hiking through the dark to a viewing spot. But in the dead of night, he becomes disorientated - in the heart of a 330,000-acre national park, covered with deep craters, steaming volcanic vents and crusty lava fields. Dewey is faced with a five day battle to live in this arid, dry, lunar landscape.<br /><br />This film was first broadcast: 03 Aug 2011<br /><br />Watch More Documentaries<br />Our Life - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3A8xRMJ">https://bit.ly/3A8xRMJ</a> <br />Our History - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3rUpdhL">https://bit.ly/3rUpdhL</a> <br />Our World - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ftuckM">https://bit.ly/3ftuckM</a> <br />Our Stories - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ynfFyk">https://bit.ly/3ynfFyk</a><br /><br />Our Life brings you fascinating stories of social interest from around the world.
