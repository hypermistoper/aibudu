You donâ€˜t have to type in every single detail in your description to have more success with the girls on Bumble. Thereâ€˜s no need to fill out everything. Less is more! The less you present, the more the women will find you mysterious and exciting.<br /><br />You can put up the following details on your Plenty of Fish profile: religion, profession, education, living situation, smoker.<br /><br />Use only the following options on Plenty of Fish in order to upgrade your profile: City, Looking for, Interested in, Relationship status: Single<br /><br />Information In Your Plenty of Fish Profile Description:<br /><br />Giving out less information about yourself in your Plenty of Fish description is not the right way to get the women to text you first. The solution lies in your Plenty of Fish About Me description. Regarding the POF About Me description, you need to know that almost all men describe themselves in the same way in their Plenty of Fish profile and use the same Plenty of Fish status messages.<br /><br />Plenty of Fish (POF) Status Messages â€“ How not to do it:<br /><br />â€œ1.75m tall, hobbies: soccer, golf, poker, billiards, TV, hanging out with friends. Character: loyal, honest, reliable, spontaneous, humorousâ€œ<br /><br />This is how almost every man makes use of his description. With a Plenty of Fish About Me description like that, youâ€˜re not setting yourself apart from other men and there is no incentive for the women to text you. Almost every man at Plenty of Fish is humorous, spontaneous, honest, romantic, keen to travel, and adventurous.<br /><br />To make you look more attractive to the women on Bumble, you have to describe yourself differently and set yourself apart from all the other men. Instead of stating that youâ€˜re humorous, express your humor this way:<br /><br />Plenty of Fish Bio â€“ A better description:<br /><br />â€œ1.45m, hobbies: The Bachelor, Germanys Next Top Model, Greyâ€™s Anatomy, Desperate Housewives. Character: unfaithful, unreliable, dishonest, unspontaneous, humorlessâ€œ<br /><br />This is how you can display your humor. Thereâ€˜s no need to mention that youâ€˜re humorous or fun to be around when you can just show it right away. Now youâ€˜re different and much more interesting than all the other Plenty of Fish profiles that look the same. However, it still isnâ€˜t your Plenty of Fish profile status thatâ€˜s going to get the women to text you first. There are many Plenty of Fish status lines that work well as long as you donâ€˜t make the aforementioned mistakes.<br /><br />Plenty of Fish Bio To Make The Girls Text You First: Two Words And The Devil Emoji<br /><br />Use the following Plenty of Fish About Me description as your Plenty of Fish status message and have the ladies text you first.
