{% raw %}Lyrics:<br /><br /><br /><br />Save some time to dream<br /><br />Save some time for yourself<br /><br />Don't let your time slip away<br /><br />Or be stolen by somebody else<br /><br />Save some time for those you love<br /><br />For they'll remember what you gave<br /><br />Save some time for the songs you sing<br /><br />And the music that you've made<br /><br /><br /><br />Could it be that this is all there is?<br /><br />Could it be there's nothing more at all?<br /><br />Save some time to dream<br /><br />'Cause your dream could save us all<br /><br /><br /><br />Save some time for sorrow<br /><br />Cause it will surely come your way<br /><br />Prepare yourself for failure<br /><br />It will give you strength some day<br /><br />Try to keep your mind open<br /><br />And accept your mistakes<br /><br />Save some time for living<br /><br />And always question your faith<br /><br /><br /><br />Could it be that this is all there is?<br /><br />Could it be there's nothing more at all?<br /><br />Save some time to dream<br /><br />'Cause your dream might save us all<br /><br /><br /><br />Cast your eyes up to heaven<br /><br />Oh what does that mean to you<br /><br />Try not to be too judgmental<br /><br />So others will not judge you<br /><br />Save some time to think<br /><br />Oh before you speak your mind<br /><br />Many will not understand<br /><br />And to them you must to be kind<br /><br /><br /><br />Could it be that this is all there is?<br /><br />Could it be there's nothing more at all?<br /><br />Save some time to dream<br /><br />'Cause your dream might save us all<br /><br /><br /><br />Oh yeah<br /><br />Your dream might save us all{% endraw %}
