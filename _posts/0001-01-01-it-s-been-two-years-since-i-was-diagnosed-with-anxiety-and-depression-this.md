{% raw %}This video is really important to me. I‚Äôm very vocal about my struggle with depression and anxiety, and I wanted to make this video for a while now. And I figured there‚Äôs no better time than in May, which is Mental Health Awareness Month.<br /><br />There is mention of suicide, therapy, familial relationships, and several topics about depression and anxiety in this video.<br /><br />Depression and anxiety is more common than you think. Someone you know could be going through it. You may be going through it, so it helps to know it‚Äôs not you against the world. May this bring you hope to continue living.<br /><br />Sending you love all the way from here. ü§ç{% endraw %}
