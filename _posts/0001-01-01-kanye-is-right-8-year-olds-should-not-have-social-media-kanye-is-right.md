{% raw %}Kanye is right. 8-year-olds should not have social media.<br /><br />It’s not appropriate to call a father “obsessive” and “controlling” for not wanting his 8-year-old daughter to have a social media account with 5 million strangers following her.<br /><br />Although a genuinely kind person (I have met her) Kim Kardashian is VERY wrong here and her daughter will wind up paying the price for it.<br /><br />Protect the children.<br /><br />#CandaceOwens{% endraw %}
