For this reason we seek to partner with parents (the greatest teachers of all!) and with church pastors and leaders, equipping them with great resource. Through fun experiences, meaningful music and ministry that encourages kids to participate, we present Jesus Christ and His Church in a relevant way, creating moments which children will never forget.<br /><br /><br /><br />Anyone can do what we do. The simple key is to love God, love His Church and have fun!{% endraw %}
