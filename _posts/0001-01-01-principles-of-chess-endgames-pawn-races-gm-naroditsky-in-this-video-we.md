{% raw %}In this video, we explore the second fundamental concept that undergirds pawn endgames: pawn races! As we find out, pawn races aren't just about blindly pushing a pawn toward promotion. Winning pawn races involves a great deal of skill, and we outline five crucial rules that will help you make the most of all pawn race situations. Having mastered these rules, you can be sure that you will pull out pawn race victories even in objectively lost positions!<br /><br />Daniel now has a Patreon!
