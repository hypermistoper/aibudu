Kinda like each card has its own little Channel attached to it, but you pay two life for a mana instead of one. So it lets you skimp on costs that way. Does Phyrexian Metamorph cost three and a blue? No! It costs three mana and you lose two life. That’s what the card says. That’s basically what all these cards say. Act of Treason used to be red! Now every color can play it. Peek used to be blue! Now, it’s all colors. With Phyrexian mana, every color also got a Windstorm. And a Spark Spray. And Rain of Blades. And Giant Growth and Reclaim and Ghostly Prison and Shivan Dragon, on and on and on. So yeah. Phyrexian mana cards are pretty color pie agnostic, and if you’re the kind of person who believes that part of what makes Magic the most enduring collectible game ever is the fact that each color resonates in a different, intuitive way… then abandoning that is a big deal.
