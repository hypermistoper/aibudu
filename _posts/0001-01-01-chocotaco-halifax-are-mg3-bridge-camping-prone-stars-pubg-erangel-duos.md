{% raw %}I spent extra time on the thumbnail with this one, dear viewer, because a friend told me I had to, and also because who doesn't want to see The chocolate Tacolate's face imposed on an actual photo of someone with an MG3? Also, if you're wondering why games from 12 days ago are just going up now, it's because I took 10 days off to go on vacation, so I made a dozen videos ahead of time so the channel could go on without me. Now we play catch-up.
