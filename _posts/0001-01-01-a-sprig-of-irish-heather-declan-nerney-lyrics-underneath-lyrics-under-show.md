{% raw %}Lyrics Under Show More.<br />This video is purely for entertainment purposes and not for profit. I give full credit to the artist and to the owners of the song used in this video.<br /><br />An Irish mother writing to her son so far away<br />Said &quot;I meant to send a shamrock to wear on Patrick's Day<br />But the shamrock is a tender plant, it's beauty soon would fade<br />So a spring of Irish heather I'm sending you instead&quot;<br /><br />Just a sprig of Irish heather<br />And It's seen all kinds of weather<br />It stood the heat of summer<br />And survived the winter's snow<br />I'm sending to remind you<br />Of the friends you left behind you<br />In Tyrone, among the bushes<br />In the days of long ago.<br /><br />But remember Carradonough and the mass rock standing there<br />How we oft times knelt together and you'd whisp a childish prayer<br />Many times since then I've wandered when the evening shadows fell<br />So I plucked this heather from the spot where once we used to kneel<br /><br />But the years from me are slipping and I know I'm growing old<br />By the fireside lonely sitting, when the nights are dark and cold<br />But I know your smile would cheer me and make sunshine out of blue<br />So come back to me acushla, when the heather is in bloom.<br /><br /><br />Just a sprig of Irish heather<br />And It's seen all kinds of weather<br />It stood the heat of summer<br />And survived the winter's cold<br />I'm sending to remind you<br />Of the friends you left behind you<br />In Tyrone, among the bushes<br />In the days of long ago.<br /><br />Just a sprig of Irish heather<br />Blessed with love from long ago{% endraw %}
