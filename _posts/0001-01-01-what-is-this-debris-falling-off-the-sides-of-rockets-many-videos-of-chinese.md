{% raw %}Many videos of Chinese Long March rockets show huge amounts of debris being shed immediately upon liftoff, and I often get asked whether that's normal. These are of course foam insulation panels needed for temperature control and depending on the rocket and the location they might be to keep them cool or to keep them warm.<br /><br />Ariane V Photo in thumbnail by Trevor Mahlmann <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tmahlmann.com/">https://www.tmahlmann.com/</a><br /><br />Follow me on Twitter for more updates:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/DJSnM">https://twitter.com/DJSnM</a><br /><br />I have a discord server where I regularly turn up:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/zStmKbM">https://discord.gg/zStmKbM</a><br /><br />If you really like what I do you can support me directly through Patreon<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/scottmanley">https://www.patreon.com/scottmanley</a>{% endraw %}
