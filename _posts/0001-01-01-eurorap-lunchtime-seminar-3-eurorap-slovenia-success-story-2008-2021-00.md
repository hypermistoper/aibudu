Along with a national schemes’ forum, these three seminar types will be presented in rotation giving us food for thought every month. The virtual seminar series is aimed at all EuroRAP partners and other interested parties – from automobile clubs to road authorities, to researchers. <br /><br />More information about each seminar and registration links are available on <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://eurorap.org/news/.">https://eurorap.org/news/.</a>{% endraw %}
