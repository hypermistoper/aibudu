{% raw %}here’s a full version of the song! so here’s the thing, spotify is super tempting but as a lot of my songs are beats i’ve sampled, i’m worried they’ll be taken down or not allowed ☹️ either way i hope you enjoy this particular track, the video isn’t the best but hey ho<br />The main piano + drum melody samples the track: flowers by sunship and sweet FA (garage classic)<br />The original chord progression is Erik Satie's Gymnopedie no. 1<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />It's 8 oclock in the morning now i'm entering my bed,<br />had a few dreams about you, i can't tell you what we did,<br />i expected to see ya, on your morning run again, <br />i know i shouldn't be watching cos everytime i feel the pain.<br />(la la la la la la la la) x2<br /><br />You told me it wasn't over and that we'd be together soon, <br />but was this before or after, you told me to leave your room,<br />I used to think we'd make it far, it turned out that we are<br />it's such a shame that we weren't the same at all.<br />(la la la la la la la) x4{% endraw %}
