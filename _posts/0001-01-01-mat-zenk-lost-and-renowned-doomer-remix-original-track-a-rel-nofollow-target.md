Once again I was mesmerized by Mat Zenk and his atmospheric song &quot;Lost and Renowned&quot; and of course I had an urge to remix it :D<br />So this remix is not quite like &quot;shanty&quot;, more of dubstep/future bass, more drive and dance potentials, the lyrics are there and funky wub-wubs too, enjoy :)<br /><br />P.S. Huge thanks to Mat Zenk for allowing me to remix his beatiful song :){% endraw %}
