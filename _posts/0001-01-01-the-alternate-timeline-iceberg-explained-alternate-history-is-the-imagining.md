{% raw %}Alternate history is the imagining of our world going down a path it didn't in our own timeline. Changes from big and small can have dramatic effects. And also can be fun ways to write stories. <br /><br />I wanted to talk about the alternate timelines that have been imagined by authors and forum users over books, shows and online threads. And what better way than through an iceberg video.<br /><br />Special thanks to TreytheExplainer for his help and inspiration.<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o2fnTNxE_Q">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o2fnTNxE_Q</a><br /><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/AltHistoryHub">https://twitter.com/AltHistoryHub</a><br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/AlternateHistoryHub">https://www.patreon.com/AlternateHistoryHub</a><br /><br />00:00 Introduction<br />01:12 Level 1<br />11:22 Level 2<br />21:48 Level 3<br />30:20 Level 4<br />36:12 Level 5<br />43:54 Level 6<br />50:11 Level 7<br />54:44 Level 8{% endraw %}
