{% raw %}In this video, I share a perspective on probability distributions that makes understanding and retaining them easier.<br /><br />Sources and Learning More<br /><br />The incredible chart mapping out the relationships among probability distributions comes from Larry Leemis and Jacquelyn McQueston[1]. They and many other contributors put together a website providing all the details on that chart : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/chart/UDR/UDR.html">http://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/chart/UDR/UDR.html</a><br /><br />Wikipedia has two [2][3] articles that provided a lot of interesting relationships. Also, John D. Cook proves that the student-T is a mixture of normals in [4].<br /><br />[1] Leemis, L. &amp; McQueston, J.T. (2008), Univariate Distribution Relationships, The American Statistician, Vol. 62, No. 1<br /><br />[2] Relationships among probability Distribution, Wikipedia, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationships_among_probability_distributions">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationships_among_probability_distributions</a><br /><br />[3] Compound Probability Distribution, Wikipedia, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_probability_distribution">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_probability_distribution</a><br /><br />[4] Cook, J.D. (2008), Student-T as a Mixture of Normals, <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.johndcook.com/">https://www.johndcook.com/</a><br /><br />Extra Notes<br /><br />In this video, I label the Poisson a &quot;continuous&quot; distribution, which is certainly not true in the general context - it is as discrete as they come. A better label than &quot;continuous&quot; would directly reference the specific limit that is taking place. Also, such a label would separate them from the other continuous distributions that can be reached with different limits.
