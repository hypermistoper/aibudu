{% raw %}Dear friends,<br />I am happy to share my next video on ‘Warranty Data Analysis using Minitab Software’. The video explains the popular Nevada format of warranty data collection and how to convert it in to suitable tabular format so that the same can be analysed using Minitab or other software. In this video, we explain the various types of failure data when Nevada format is used.  In some of our previous videos, we have already discussed various types of life data i.e. complete, right censored, left censored and interval censored. When all these types of data are present at the same time, we call such data as multiply censored. Such type of data can be analysed on Minitab using the commands for arbitrarily censored data. The videos explains:<br />1. How to convert data from Nevada format to table format that can be analysed on Minitab<br />2. How to use Minitab to identify the distribution that best fits our data<br />3. Estimate parameters of the selected distribution<br />4. Estimate reliability or probability of failure at specified time(s)<br />The procedure is explained in detail using an application example. In the video, I have also explained how to estimate expected number of failures by 24 month warranty period and also the 95% upper bound which is the worst-case scenario. <br />I am sure, you will find this video interesting and useful for practical application of Warranty Data Analysis!<br />Your feedback on the video is welcome!<br />If you find the video useful, do not forget to click the like button and subscribe to our channel ‘Institute of Quality and Reliability’. <br /><br />With best wishes.<br /><br />Hemant Urdhwareshe{% endraw %}
