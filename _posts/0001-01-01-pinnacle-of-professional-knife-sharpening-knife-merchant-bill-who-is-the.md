{% raw %}Bill who is the knife-smith at Knife Merchant located in San Diego really knows his stuff. He's been sharpening knives as a little boy and now he does it professionally, but his skills go beyond just bringing a sharp edge to your knife; he's able to repair and straighten a bent knife and render it useful again. His services aren't for everyone though; it's for the discerning customer who really needs an extremely sharp knife, or the person that needs to have the absolute best of everything.<br /><br /><br />Follow Hiroyuki Terada:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://facebook.com/pages/NoVe-kitchen-and-bar/175557962456764">https://facebook.com/pages/NoVe-kitchen-and-bar/175557962456764</a> <br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/diariesofamastersushichef/">https://www.instagram.com/diariesofamastersushichef/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/RealSushiChef">https://twitter.com/RealSushiChef</a><br /><br />Hiro's Second Channel: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/user/MIAMISPICE68">https://youtube.com/user/MIAMISPICE68</a> <br /><br />Cameraman's Channel: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/charlespreston">https://www.youtube.com/charlespreston</a><br /><br /><br />Watch More Hiroyuki Terada:<br />Recent Uploads: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw4w6pxDkwuYuWPKACrEdlFbNXtFK52AU">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw4w6pxDkwuYuWPKACrEdlFbNXtFK52AU</a><br />Popular Videos: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw4w6pxDkwuZYtstHx4FrAi8ftIz7sPvz">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw4w6pxDkwuZYtstHx4FrAi8ftIz7sPvz</a><br />Extreme Series: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw4w6pxDkwuY19AA30--T67M3K-WGriC8">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw4w6pxDkwuY19AA30--T67M3K-WGriC8</a><br />Low Difficulty Recipes: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw4w6pxDkwuYWch7Yc_lFyoSU9_M2Lvw5">https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLw4w6pxDkwuYWch7Yc_lFyoSU9_M2Lvw5</a><br /><br /><br />Support our Patreon page to see exclusive content not seen on YouTube, videos that will make you a better sushi chef, and recipes that will dazzle your tastebuds...Master Sushi Chef Hiroyuki Terada shares his utmost intimate knowledge with you. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/diariesofamastersushichef">https://www.patreon.com/diariesofamastersushichef</a><br /> <br /><br />As always, we wish to thank all of our fans for spending time here with us on YouTube.
