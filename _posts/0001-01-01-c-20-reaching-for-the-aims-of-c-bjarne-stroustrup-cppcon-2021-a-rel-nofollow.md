I outline some early ideals for C++, some techniques for keeping the evolution directed, and show how C++20 comes close to many of those ideals. Specific topics includes type-and-resource safe code, generic programming, modularity, and the elimination of the preprocessor. Naturally, over the years, C++ has acquired many “barnacles” that can become obstacles to developing elegant and efficient code. That has been a recognized problem since the early days of C – Dennis Ritchie and I talked about it – so we must distinguish between what can be done and what should be done. The C++ Core Guidelines is the current best effort in that direction.<br /><br />---<br />Bjarne Stroustrup<br />C++: history, design, use, standardization, future; performance, reliability; software developer education; distributed systems <br /><br />Bio: www.stroustrup.com/bio.html<br />---<br />Videos Filmed &amp; Edited by Bash Films: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.BashFilms.com">http://www.BashFilms.com</a><br /><br />The CppCon YouTube Channel Is Sponsored By:<br />JetBrains : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://jb.gg/cpptools">http://jb.gg/cpptools</a> <br />SonarSource:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.sonarsource.com/">https://www.sonarsource.com/</a>{% endraw %}
