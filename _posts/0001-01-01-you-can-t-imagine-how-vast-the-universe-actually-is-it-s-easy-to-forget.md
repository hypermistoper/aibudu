{% raw %}It’s easy to forget the scale of the world around us, and comprehend exactly how small we are in comparison to the rest of existence. It's not until you have a moment of stillness to contemplate the curiosities of life itself or look up into the night sky and attempt to fathom the fact we are living on a floating rock in the universe. We share our planet with animals of different sizes, many of which are smaller than us. When we take a look closer to the ground and watch the ants scurry about the Earth at almost microscopic sizes, it’s easy to think we are the giants of the universe. And yet, if we take a step back and take a look at everything around us, beyond Earth and into the cosmos, we are humbly reminded that in the grand scheme of the universe, we are the microorganisms and space is the giant, a vast frontier larger than anything you could ever imagine. To better paint a picture of our role in the cosmos, we must give context to the true and terrifying size of the universe.<br /><br />0:00 Introduction<br />1:22 The Past<br />5:36 The Present<br />10:15 The Future<br /><br />Music composed by CO.AG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcavSftXHgxLBWwLDm_bNvA</a><br /><br />Thank you for watching.<br /><br /><br />DISCLAIMER: All materials in these videos are used for entertainment purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
