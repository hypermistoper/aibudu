{% raw %}asa a review of the end of the second season of my little pony friendship is magic<br /><br />this actually begin in the work shortly after the airing time of those episodes but i couldn't do a good enough editing job that i wanted for this review and this (plus a litter further that you still don't know about) is how far a sort of friend of mine who's good at editing videos got of this about 20 minute review shortly after and never went to finish the rest.....<br /><br />so if anybody watching this actually wants to see the full review i might have to stop not wanting to edit and being busy to get vegas to actually properly publish the danm thing so i can put the rest of it together.....{% endraw %}
