{% raw %}Just Enough Calculation is a mod that lets you quickly program recipe plans and calculates the ingredients you need, including what ingredients are missing from your inventory, machines needed, crafting procedure, and so on. In this spotlight, I explain all of its features.<br /><br />If you're worried about the mod's usefulness, I can provide my own testimony: it was far easier to craft Ultimate Hybrid Solars after I installed the mod, because I knew all the resources and could gather and process them all before going through the crafting quickly and easily. Also, when I set up my Advanced Generators build in Age of Engineering episode 6, knowing how much of the many, many intermediaries I needed sped up the process immensely. It's worth it.<br /><br />I changed my recording software this time around, in hopes to eliminate the pops from my previous video. It requires substantially more editing the more mistakes I make, but it's not that bad. As always, I'd love feedback, and publicity is helpful, too.<br /><br />Supershorts skip all the extra fluff and focus on the action, compressed into a concise, step-by-step format.{% endraw %}
