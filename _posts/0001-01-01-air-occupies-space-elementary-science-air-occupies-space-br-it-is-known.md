{% raw %}Air Occupies Space<br />It is known fact that humans along with other living beings breathe air to leave. Air is colorless and can't be seen but presence can felt every where <br />The following activity demonstrates that air takes space. To find out if an empty bottle is really empty or not, take an empty glass bottle invert this bottle into bucket filled this bottle. You will notice that water does not completely occupy the bottle and large part of the bottle remains empty. This is due to presence of air inside the bottle. It doesn't allow of water to fill the bottle. Now incline the bottle slightly. Bubbles come out of the bottle. These bubbles are nothing but air present in the bottle which escapes when the bottle is inclined.<br />The air escapes from the bottle when the bottle is immersed upright into the bucket and gets displaced by the water which enters into the bottle. When the bottle is inclined gradually the water fills the bottle entirely and the flow of bubbles from the bottle stops. This experiment confirms that air occupies space.{% endraw %}
