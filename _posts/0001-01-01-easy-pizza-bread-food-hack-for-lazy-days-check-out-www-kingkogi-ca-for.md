Create the sauce: slice the mushrooms and cook them first in 1 tbsp olive oil over medium heat until they start to release water and look soft. <br /><br />2. Chop the tomatoes roughly, add to the mushrooms. Add the herbs and salt + pepper for flavour.  Cook for about 2-3 min until tomatoes start to lose their shape and get mushy.<br /><br />3. Squeeze about 2 tbsp of ketchup onto the tomatoes and mix together.<br /><br />4. Add the ham, mix all together until warm, 1-2 min. turn off the heat.<br /><br />5. Take your bread, spread the sauce + toppings evenly. Cover in cheese and top with the remaining uncooked cherry tomato slices. Add a pinch of salt to the tomato.<br /><br />6. Grill in a toaster oven or on the grill setting until the cheese melts to your prefered gooeyness. I did it for about 2-3 minutes. Dig in and wonder about the other toppings you could be adding to this magic easy pizza bread.<br /><br />NOTE: If you only have a stove top,  add a little olive oil/butter to the pan and put on low-medium. Add all the toppings and cheese to the bread, and cover with lid to create a steamy meltenvironmentnt while toasting the bottom of your bread. Keep on eye on the bread, the bottom can burn quickly, especially with butter! <br /><br />╚═══════════════╝<br /><br />。°。°。°。°。°。°。°。°。°。°。°。°。°。°。°。°。°。°。°。°。°。°<br /><br />When Life Gives You Lemons  🍋 Lemon Drop Martini Recipe 🍸<br /><br />-2 SHOTS vodka<br />-1/2 SHOT GRAND MARNIER (or Cointreau/Triple Sec)<br />-1 SHOT FRESH squeezed lemon juice<br />-1/2 SHOT simple syrup (add up to 1/2 shot more if too tart for your taste)<br /><br />Add all ingredients into martini shaker filled with ice. <br />Shake it, shake shake it, shake it...UH OHHH~ *dances*<br />Using the left over lemon, rub it on the rim of a glass lightly and roll the rim of the glass in sugar.<br />Strain the drink into the glass.
