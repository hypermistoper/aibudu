{% raw %}Turning Red is Disney Pixar's latest film that has been received with widespread acclaim and general audience enjoyment. However, there has been a pushback by conservatives. The film deals with a coming of age story that covers topics like puberty, periods and sneaking out to concerts behind your parents back. Many right-wing parents were uncomfortable with the subject matter and believed it promoted undesirable morals in kids. This took a more sinister tone as Conservatives are using their campaign against Disney as a trojan horse to attack LGBT rights. <br /><br />Then - Enter YouTuber: Mr Enter. This YouTube video Essayist chimed in with his own criticism of the movie. Among his complaints about story and unlikeable characters, he also criticised the film's authenticity to the year it was set in - 2002. His complaints ranged from the music and consumer goods on show... to the movie not sufficiently dealing with the impact of 9/11 on Western society... As we all know, any good kids movie deals with the impact of 9/11. <br /><br />In the video, we respond to Enter's review and document how Turning Red got caught up in the Culture War<br /><br />.00:00:00 - Intro <br />00:04:00 - Mr Enter becomes the main character <br />00:09:15 - Turning Red needed to show the impact of 9/11 <br />00:14:55 - Mr Enter's reactions and the MEMES <br />00:18:30 - Turning Red enters the Culture War <br />00:22:54 - The Anti-SJWs give their criticism <br />00:24:55 - Closing Thoughts <br /><br />My Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/join/TheKavernacle">https://www.patreon.com/join/TheKavernacle</a><br /><br />Second Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtet3kEWqgKj6sSfMgf2n7A">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtet3kEWqgKj6sSfMgf2n7A</a><br /><br />My Unofficial Discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/5HMHZ4RHUH">https://discord.gg/5HMHZ4RHUH</a><br /><br />Second Channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtet3kEWqgKj6sSfMgf2n7A">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtet3kEWqgKj6sSfMgf2n7A</a><br /><br />My Podcast: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2g88k90PsIKnDxU39lU0qi?nd=1&amp;nd=1">https://open.spotify.com/show/2g88k90PsIKnDxU39lU0qi?nd=1&amp;nd=1</a><br /><br />My Subreddit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheKavernacle/">https://www.reddit.com/r/TheKavernacle/</a><br /><br />My Personal Reddit:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/tommycahil1995">https://www.reddit.com/user/tommycahil1995</a><br /><br />Follow me on Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com//TheKavernacle">https://twitter.com//TheKavernacle</a><br /><br />My Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/thekavernacle/">https://instagram.com/thekavernacle/</a><br /><br />My Medium: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://medium.com/@thekavernacle">https://medium.com/@thekavernacle</a>{% endraw %}
