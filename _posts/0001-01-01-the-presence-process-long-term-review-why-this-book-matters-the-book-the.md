{% raw %}The book ''The Presence Process'' By Michael Brown has to date been one of the most important books released. When I started out with reading this book I was struggling with depression, and apathy. After Going through this process 3 full times I can now safely say that present moment awareness as explained in the Book by Michael Brown is a must read for anyone wanting more happiness, fulfilment and authenticity in their lives. The presence moment awareness may seem trivial to the untrained eye, but once you choose to get the emotional part of your life handled, a lot of the chaos in your life will gradually disappear. <br /><br />Do not hesitate to ask if you have any questions about this process, or in general ;){% endraw %}
