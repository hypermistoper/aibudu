{% raw %}Risk Disclosure: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/nnmrwP">https://goo.gl/nnmrwP</a> TESTIMONIAL DISCLOSURE: TESTIMONIALS APPEARING ON QUANTUM TRADING MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHER CLIENTS OR CUSTOMERS AND IS NOT A GUARANTEE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE OR SUCCESS.<br /><br />The TradingView platform is a terrific charting application with many great features, but best of all and something we often forget is the fact that it is browser based and can therefore be used on any device you wish. So you can run the Quantum Trading indicators on pc, Mac or mobile. It's your decision. <br /><br />And this is another exciting indicator we have developed for the TradingView platform and it's called the Accumulation and Distribution indicator, which works in a similar way to that on the NinjaTrader platform. The beauty of the indicator is that is presents a visual and intuitive picture of support and resistance in all timeframes where the thickness of the line denotes the strength of the area, whether support or resistance. So as a trader you will have a visual image that shows you instantly where these levels are and how strong or weak. Remember also when weaker areas cluster together then these too become strong. So another great indicator for the TradingView platform and one which we know will be extremely popular.{% endraw %}
