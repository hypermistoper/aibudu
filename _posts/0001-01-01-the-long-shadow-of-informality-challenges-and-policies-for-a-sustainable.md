{% raw %}In emerging markets and developing economies, large numbers of people work outside the legal and regulatory framework: they account for 70 percent of employment and about a third of GDP. These ‚Äúinformal‚Äù workers were more likely to lose their jobs or suffer severe income losses during COVID-19 lockdowns‚Äîand they tend to be largely excluded from social safety nets. Against this backdrop, this event will explore the findings of the first comprehensive study of the extent of informality and its implications for a sustainable and inclusive recovery going forward.
