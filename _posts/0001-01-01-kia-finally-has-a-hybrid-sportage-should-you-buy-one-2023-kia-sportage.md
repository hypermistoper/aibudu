{% raw %}The all-new Sportage breaks from the mold of the prior generations with a serious focus on fuel economy with an all-new hybrid version and soon a plug in hybrid as well. The other big change? The Sportage has been super-sized. The massive growth now puts the Sportage as the model in this segment with the most cargo room and most legroom. Looking for something bigger inside than this? You'll have to skip a bunch of mid-size options and get something even bigger.<br /><br />#Sportage #SportageHybrid #Kia #KiaSportage #Hybrid #HEV #PHEV #PluginHybrid{% endraw %}
