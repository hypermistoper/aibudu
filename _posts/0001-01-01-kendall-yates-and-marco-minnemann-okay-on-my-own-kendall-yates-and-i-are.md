{% raw %}Kendall Yates and I are going to release a 3 track EP on this monthâ€™s Bandcamp Friday (March 4th), the day on which 100% of the sales proceeds go directly to the artists (thank you Bandcamp and thank YOU for supporting independ music releases).<br />Iâ€™m very pleased about how this piece turned out, called â€˜Okay On My Ownâ€™. This oneâ€™s going straight into the more dark and desert vibe area, which I always had deep appreciation for, as it requires discipline and the fitting palette of sounds and arrangement to create the right environment. Itâ€™s almost a cinematic experience, painting an image to the song. <br />But what impressed me the most was that Kendall recorded that song literally in one take! What youâ€™re witnessing here is pretty much a live take of vocals and drums, unedited, the rest of the ingredients overdubbed after.<br />â€˜Okay On My Ownâ€™ was written by Kendall and I arranged the music and played the instruments. Hope you like our first collaboration together. ðŸ˜Š<br />Bandcamp link to follow in the coming days.{% endraw %}
