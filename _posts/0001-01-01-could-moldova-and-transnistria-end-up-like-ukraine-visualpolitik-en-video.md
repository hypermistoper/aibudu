Moldova, one of the poorest countries on earth, has within its territory the Pridnestrovian Moldovan Republic, better known as Transnistria. A self-proclaimed republic that is supported by Moscow.<br /> <br />In contrast, in 2020 a new pro-European government came to power in Moldova, which, as you can imagine, is not exactly to the Kremlin's liking. What role could Moldova and Transnistria play in the war in Ukraine? What exactly is the danger of Moldova becoming Putin's next target? How does the Kremlin hope to overthrow the current Moldovan government? In this video we tell you all the details.<br /><br />Join the VisualPolitik community and support us on Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/VisualPolitik">https://www.patreon.com/VisualPolitik</a>{% endraw %}
