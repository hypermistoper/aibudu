{% raw %}On today’s episode of restorations and customs with Vick, the man himself is going to be restoring an unwearable pair of Homer Simpson Nike Dunk Lows from 2004. These things have seen better days, and due to the glue being stale and old, wouldn’t survive a day on foot. <br /><br />Luckily, Vick knows how to re-glue these rare Dunks and make them wearable once again. <br /><br />Besides taking the shoe completely apart and putting it back together, Vick is also going to use the Reshoevn8r Signature Shoe Cleaning Kit to clean up the suede uppers, leather toe box, midsole, and the outsole. <br /><br />There’s not a Dunk that Vick can’t handle…here’s how he brought the 2004 Homer Dunks back to life. <br /><br />First Vick took the entire shoe apart using a pick (to remove the stitching on the midsole) and some good ol’ manpower to peel the midsole, upper, and foam insert apart. It didn’t require much force considering how old the glue is on these joints. <br /><br />Now that the shoe is in pieces, it’s time to apply some new glue. Vick applied the glue and let it cure for a few hours, and then used a heat gun to activate the glue and stick the Homer Dunks back together piece by piece. <br /><br />Vick Almighty isn’t a seamstress by any means, but his excellence in stitching proved helpful as he put the midsole back together stitch by stitch with color-matched brown thread. <br /><br />The Dunks are now wearable…but they sure are dirty. Time to pull out the Signature Shoe Cleaning Kit from Reshoevn8r and get to work. It should easily be able to tackle and clean the suede on these shoes without damaging it. <br /><br />Starting with the Soft Bristle Brush, Vick used the Shoe Cleaning Solution to scrub the uppers of the shoe. After the preliminary scrub, he noticed some underlying stains in the suede and toe box. He used the Medium Bristle Brush to remove these and then used the Stiff Bristle Brush to scrub the outsole, which was admittedly pretty clean for how old these are. <br /><br />Due to both age and a foreign substance that was spilled on these at one point, the suede had some stains that were almost impossible to remove. Even after taking sandpaper to the suede, some stains still remain. But, Vick did use the Brass Bristle Brush to reset the nap of the suede, so at least they feel buttery soft again. <br /><br />Lastly, Vick used some yellow dye and an airbrush to bring the yellow swoosh back to life, I mean at this point you could barely tell it was yellow at all. A quick tape job and a few strokes of the airbrush, and now you can see why these were dubbed the “Homer Simpson” Dunks. <br /><br />All that’s left is to lace em’ and rock em’. <br /><br />And that my friends, is how to restore the Homer Simpson Nike Dunks. <br /><br />How do y’all think Vick did? For a shoe this old, we’d venture to say he did pretty darn well. <br /><br />Thanks for tuning it.
