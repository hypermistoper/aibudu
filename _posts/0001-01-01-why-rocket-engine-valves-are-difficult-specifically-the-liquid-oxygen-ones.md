And we will try to answer whether our home-built liquid oxygen valve prototype for our upcoming 100kN ethalox rocket engine can actually do its job under all the cryogenic pressure.<br /><br />Copenhagen Suborbitals is the world's only crewed, crowdfunded space program. In the future, a volunteer astronaut will fly to space on our home-built rocket. We do this in our spare time, all the donations go to paying our workshop rent and buying materials. We are forever thankful to each of our supporters!<br /><br />Twitter   : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CopSub">https://twitter.com/CopSub</a><br />Facebook  : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CopenhagenSuborbitals">https://www.facebook.com/CopenhagenSuborbitals</a><br />Instagram : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/copsub/">https://www.instagram.com/copsub/</a><br />LinkedIn  : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/copenhagen-suborbitals">https://www.linkedin.com/company/copenhagen-suborbitals</a><br />Pinterest : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pinterest.com/copsub/">https://www.pinterest.com/copsub/</a><br /><br />Intro and Outro Music by Everyday Astronaut:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.everydayastronaut.com">https://www.everydayastronaut.com</a><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />00:00 - Intro<br />00:44 - Valve Assembly Break-down<br />01:46 - Challenges with Operating Cryogenic Valves<br />04:29 - Testing our BPM-100 Rocket Engine Valve with Liquid Oxygen<br />05:08 - Test Results: Real Life Out-performing the Simulation?<br />06:44 - Solenoid vs. Ball Valves<br />07:24 - The First BPM-100 Engine Combustion Chamber Parts!<br />08:03 - You Can Help Support the Spica Rocket!<br />08:44 - Outro{% endraw %}
