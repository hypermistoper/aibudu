If you think the kids in your family are a lot to handle, imagine having over a dozen of them! That was the reality for the royal women in today’s video. The primary expectation of Queens and other well born women of the past was to have as many children as possible to secure their husband’s dynasty and bare a few spares to be used in advantageous political marriages. Their fertility was their life. They were married early and caught on a treadmill of pregnancy, birth, handing their babies over to be raised by wet-nurses and tutors, and hoping back into bed to conceive again as soon as possible. Surely they looked forward to the relief of menopause. Here are 9 Queens and Empresses who bore an extraordinary number of children:<br />Mumtaz Mahal, Mughal Empress Consort - 14 Children<br />Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Queen Consort of Great Britain &amp; Ireland  - 15 Children<br />Anna Jagellonica, Queen Consort of Germany, Bohemia &amp; Hungary - 15 Children<br />Eleanor of Castile, Queen Consort of England - 16 Children<br />Keran, Queen Consort of Armenia - 16 Children<br />Maria Theresa, Holy Roman Empress - 16 Children<br />Maria Carolina of Austria, Queen Consort of Naples and Sicily - 17 Children<br />Anne, Queen of Great Britain - 18 Children<br />Darejan Dadiani, Queen Consort of Georgia - 23 Children<br /><br />Maria Theresa's Daughters: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/vlLI1bp6BeA">https://youtu.be/vlLI1bp6BeA</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mtvFd_ciI5Y">https://youtu.be/mtvFd_ciI5Y</a><br />Maria Theresa's Sons: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/S1lp9qMACfo">https://youtu.be/S1lp9qMACfo</a><br /><br />I make mini documentaries about women's history and royal history:<br />Queens of the World: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lxDVWL1aN4&amp;list=PLsiuz33wEZhj6CFEHrw47ulNyvyHO57J8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lxDVWL1aN4&amp;list=PLsiuz33wEZhj6CFEHrw47ulNyvyHO57J8</a><br />A History of... <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A8yKzJN-C0&amp;list=PLsiuz33wEZhii9xcG1p2FmkfzWf2Axv8b">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_A8yKzJN-C0&amp;list=PLsiuz33wEZhii9xcG1p2FmkfzWf2Axv8b</a><br />Royal History: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnisWy9P9u0&amp;list=PLsiuz33wEZhjKGD6PxxG-xkT_ZTTchMFV">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QnisWy9P9u0&amp;list=PLsiuz33wEZhjKGD6PxxG-xkT_ZTTchMFV</a><br />LGBT Royals: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUW1AqFIY94&amp;list=PLsiuz33wEZhgGKCsUDY6R-5YcLrEFLc2i">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUW1AqFIY94&amp;list=PLsiuz33wEZhgGKCsUDY6R-5YcLrEFLc2i</a><br />Sources:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org">https://en.wikipedia.org</a> <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.britannica.com">https://www.britannica.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk">http://www.englishmonarchs.co.uk</a><br /><br />Music: Bellissimo by Doug Maxwell<br /><br />For business inquiries, please contact LindsayHoliday@ellify.com{% endraw %}
