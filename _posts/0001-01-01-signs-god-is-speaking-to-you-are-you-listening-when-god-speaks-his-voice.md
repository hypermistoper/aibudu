{% raw %}When God speaks, His voice introduces His purpose to us. We see the mind of God in the voice of His words. The power of God rides upon His voice when He speaks. Take time away from it all and shut yourself up alone with God. Spend time with your Bible and in prayers. Spend time in meditation. Carry out that spiritual retreat, that spiritual housecleaning. <br />#motivation #sermon #motivationalvideo <br />Donation &amp; Support: <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/INRImotivation?country.x=MD&amp;locale.x=en_US">https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/INRImotivation?country.x=MD&amp;locale.x=en_US</a><br />Footage Licensed Through Filmpac<br />Don't forget to subscribe our channel to watch new motivational videos.{% endraw %}
