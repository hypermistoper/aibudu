{% raw %}Celebrated mythologist, wilderness guide, and writer, Martin Shaw chats to Idler editor Tom Hodgkinson about his new book, Smoke Hole, and the role of oral story-telling in the modern world.<br /><br />Smoke Hole offers a path forward that we might use to look through the smoke hole and find a new vision: he shows how, in a world of fake news, crises, addiction, social media, and loneliness, myths can be both guides and allies.

Author of the award-winning Mythteller trilogy (A Branch from the Lightning Tree, Snowy Tower, Scatterlings), he founded the Oral Tradition and Mythic Life courses at Stanford University, and is director of the Westcountry School of Myth in the UK. Martin has introduced thousands of people to mythology and how it penetrates modern life. For twenty years Shaw has been a wilderness rites of passage guide, working with at-risk youth, those who are unwell, returning veterans as well as many women and men seeking a deeper life. Martin’s translations of Gaelic poetry and folklore (with Tony Hoagland) have been published in Orion magazine, Poetry International, Kenyon Review, Poetry magazine and Mississippi Review. Shaw’s most recent books include Smoke Hole, The Night Wages, Cinderbiter, Wolf Milk, Courting the Wild Twin, All Those Barbarians, Wolferland and his Lorca translations, Courting the Dawn (with Stephan Harding). His essay and conversation with Ai Weiwei on myth and migration was released by the Marciano Art Foundation. In Martin’s most recent podcast series, called the Smoke Hole Sessions, the writer chatted to an array of artist, writers, activists, musicians and more about the themes and topics arising out of his new book.<br /><br />This conversation was recorded as part of the Idler's weekly online event, A Drink with the Idler. The full recording is available to magazine and Academy subscribers.
