{% raw %}Kamisato Ayato was announced recently by mihoyo, and players don't seem to be happy with his design, Many are complaining that his face and hair are similar to Baizhu, and it is just mihoyo being lazy with it.<br />personally, I love his design and I will be looking forward to pulling for him in version 2.6 of Genshin impact.<br />==================================================<br />music: genshin impact<br />=================================================={% endraw %}
