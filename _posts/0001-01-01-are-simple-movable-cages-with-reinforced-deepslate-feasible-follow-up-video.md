{% raw %}Follow up video discussing some of the issues with moving withers with reinforced deepslate. It's definitely possible to move a wither somewhere, but  it's only really useful if the setup is tileable, can take out blocks like obsidian and it's possible to change the direction.<br />Besides it's already confirmed that reinforced deepslate is not supposed to be movable.<br /><br />support this channel:<br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/user?u=4255112">https://www.patreon.com/user?u=4255112</a><br /><br />second channel: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpK5XWtxTuCtsKkwQnJbNIw">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCpK5XWtxTuCtsKkwQnJbNIw</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ilmango1">https://twitter.com/ilmango1</a><br />Twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/ilmango">https://www.twitch.tv/ilmango</a><br /><br />SciCraft Discord:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/scicraft">https://discord.gg/scicraft</a><br /><br />Outro: Reckless by Olivaw <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://soundcloud.com/olivaw">https://soundcloud.com/olivaw</a> Creative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported— CC BY 3.0 <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a> Music provided by Music for Creators <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/0SuBLhi236M">https://youtu.be/0SuBLhi236M</a>{% endraw %}
