{% raw %}In 2006 the world was introduced to the Playaway - an all-in-one audiobook player, where each device held a single pre-loaded book which could not be swapped out. It seems inevitable that this would be another of those single-use gadgets replaced by the smartphone...and yet in 2022 the Playaway lives on. In this video you'll see a demo and discover how and why it survived. <br /><br />Here’s a link to a teardown - it turns out the audio format isn’t MP3 after all - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mitsake.net/2019/06/playaway-audiobook-teardown/">https://www.mitsake.net/2019/06/playaway-audiobook-teardown/</a><br /><br />------------- Merchandise -----------------<br />Updated Techmoan Merchandise is now available. <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/nerdkeyz?ref=seller-platform-mcnav&amp;section_id=37136753">https://www.etsy.com/uk/shop/nerdkeyz?ref=seller-platform-mcnav&amp;section_id=37136753</a><br /><br />--------------- SUBSCRIBE ------------------<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/user/Techmoan?sub_confirmation=1">http://www.youtube.com/user/Techmoan?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />------------- SUPPORT ---------------<br />This channel can be supported through Patreon <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/techmoan">https://www.patreon.com/techmoan</a><br />  <br />*******Patrons usually have early access to videos*******<br /><br />---------- Outro Music -----------<br />Over Time - Vibe Tracks <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/VSSswVZSgJw">https://youtu.be/VSSswVZSgJw</a><br /><br />------ Outro Sound Effect ------<br />ThatSFXGuy - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/5M3-ZV5-QDM">https://youtu.be/5M3-ZV5-QDM</a><br /><br />------ AFFILIATED LINKS/ADVERTISING NOTICE -------<br />All links are Affiliated where possible.<br />When you click on links to various merchants posted here and make a purchase, this can result in me earning a commission.

I'll show the first version of a video on Patreon and often the feedback I get results in a video going through further revisions to improve it.  e.g. Fix audio issues, clarify points, add extra footage or cut extraneous things out. The video that goes live on youtube is the final version. If you want to see the videos early too, you can sign up to Patreon here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/techmoan">https://www.patreon.com/techmoan</a>{% endraw %}
