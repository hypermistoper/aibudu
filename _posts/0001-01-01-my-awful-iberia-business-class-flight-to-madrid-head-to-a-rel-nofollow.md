There was little premium about today's experience, the cabin cleanliness was shocking, the inflight food was lacking and in part inedible and given the price point of this flight - it offers poor value for money. <br /><br />As always I offer a brutally honest review of what it's like to fly in the pointy end, so you can expect a comprehensive review of the Business Class lounge at Chicago airport, along with a seat tour, food &amp; beverage walkthrough and that all important &quot;bed&quot; rating. As always do let me know what you think, and also what your experience of Iberia has been to date? Was this just them on a really bad day, or this actually a more common occurrence?{% endraw %}
