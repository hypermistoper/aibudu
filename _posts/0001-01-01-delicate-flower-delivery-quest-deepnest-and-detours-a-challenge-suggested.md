{% raw %}A challenge suggested by Angelos D. to complete the delicate flower quest by taking it through Deepnest. Going down through the City of Tears and to Deepnest via the tram and then up to Queen's Gardens isn't actually that bad so I may have added a detour to make it slightly more challenging. <br /><br />For some reason my recording settings changed and had the record button show up, so apologies for that.<br /><br />My Social Media Stuff:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/bnv3V6t">https://discord.gg/bnv3V6t</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/CrankyTemplar">https://twitter.com/CrankyTemplar</a>{% endraw %}
