{% raw %}Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been given a standing ovation from British lawmakers as he addressed the House of Commons via video link. <br /><br />In his historic speech, Mr Zelensky compared the conflict to Britain's role in the Second World War.<br /><br />“I am grateful to you, Boris; please increase the pressure of sanctions, please recognise Russia as a terrorist state, please make sure our Ukrainian skies are safe, please make sure you do what needs to be done and what is stipulated by the greatness of your country,” he said.  <br /><br />In response to the Ukrainian President’s plea, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to deliver what is needed. <br /><br />Mr Johnson said the government would “employ every method” they can until Russian President Vladimir Putin has “failed” in his invasion of Ukraine.{% endraw %}
