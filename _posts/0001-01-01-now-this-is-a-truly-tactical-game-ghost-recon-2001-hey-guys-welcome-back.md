{% raw %}Hey guys welcome back and today we're taking a look at a classic, the original Ghost Recon! While for some of you this is a trip down memory lane for me this is a first time look at where the series started! Ghost Recon has definitely come a very long way and while I do enjoy the newer games they've made I have to say there is something extremely satisfying about successfully executing a well planned maneuver.<br /><br /> So far I've really enjoyed my first taste of this game and I'll definitely be coming back to it so be sure to let me know if you guys want to see more! :){% endraw %}
