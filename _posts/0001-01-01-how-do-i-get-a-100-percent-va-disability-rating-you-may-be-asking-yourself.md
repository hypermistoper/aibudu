{% raw %}You may be asking yourself How Do I Get A 100 Percent VA Disability Rating? And the short answer is that it really comes down to the severity of your symptoms and if your VA disability ratings are considered static. <br /><br />🔴 Learn more about the VA Claims Process here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.combatcraig.com">http://www.combatcraig.com</a><br />🔥 Join the conversation on DISCORD: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/tGvKnnrsX7">https://discord.gg/tGvKnnrsX7</a><br /><br />Total and Permanent Disability VA, also known as 100 percent P&amp;T, applies to veterans whose disabilities are Total (any impairment of mind or body which is sufficient to render it impossible for the average person to follow a substantially gainful occupation) AND Permanent (impairment is reasonably certain to continue throughout the life of the disabled person).<br /><br />What does “100% Scheduler” Mean?<br /><br />The title 100% Scheduler means that you are 100% disabled. When you have this title, you can be re-evaluated every 4 to 5 years at the VA’s request. You can work as much as you would like.<br /><br />However, the VA can reduce your disability percentage if they feel you are doing better from a review of your medical records and treatment. If you have not continued your prescribed treatment or stopped taking your medications, then it could trigger the VA to investigate why you are not following your treatment. The VA might think, “You must be getting better, right?” In this type of situation, your disability rating may very well be reduced significantly.<br /><br />What does 100% Permanent and Total (P &amp; T) Mean?<br /><br />100% Permanent and Total means that you are 100%, permanently disabled, and most likely are never going to be re-evaluated. You are still able to work as much as you want and can. This is where confusion can occur.<br /><br />The thought of 100% Permanent and Total makes a person think that they will not be able to work. This is not correct. You can work, start a business, or follow whichever path life takes you on. The way the VA deems a disability “permanent” is when, based on medical evidence, the provider is confident that the level of impairment will continue for the rest of the veteran’s life.<br /><br /><br />For this reason, the VA is allowed to take age into account when determining whether a disability is permanent. This can make it difficult for younger veterans to be considered permanently disabled. Do not let this discourage you from attempting to attain 100% Permanent and Total.
