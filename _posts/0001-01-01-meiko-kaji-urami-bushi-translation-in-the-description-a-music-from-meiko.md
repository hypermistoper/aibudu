{% raw %}A music from Meiko Kaji, a japanese actress and singer. This song, you may know it from Kill Bill. Here it goes the English translation:<br /><br />My Grudge Blues<br /><br />&quot;You're beautiful, you're the flower, he praises you.<br />But if you bloom, he will get you scattered.<br />Stupid. So stupid.<br />I go so stupid singin' my grudge blues.<br /><br />You can accept your pitiful fate.<br />But when you cry, he'll make you cry more.<br />Women, oh women,<br />It's women's tears that makes my grudge blues.<br /><br />I hate you. Full of regret, never forgiven.<br />Try to erase my memory, but cannot forget you.<br />It never ends, never,<br />It never ends, 'cause that's my grudge blues.<br /><br />They say it's a dream, embers of one-sided attachment,<br />laughing at you.<br />So you decide to wake up, but fear to be fully awake.<br />Women, oh women,<br />Women's soul beats on my grudge blues.<br /><br />Crimson roses have its sharp thorns.<br />Don't wanna hurt you, but have to stab you with my thorn.<br />Burning, it's burning,<br />It keeps on burning within my grudge blues.<br /><br />No flower would bloom on my dead body.<br />So I will live along hanging on my grudge.<br />Women, oh women,<br />My woman's life belongs to my grudge blues.&quot;{% endraw %}
