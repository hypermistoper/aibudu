{% raw %}Dr. Rajdeep Mysore | Appointment booking number: 9110865951<br />Consultant Dermatologist &amp; Dermatosurgeon | Charma Chirag Hospital, Bangalore<br />Food Allergy can be caused by any proteins. So nuts have a lot of proteins, nuts are a common cause,  peanuts  are  a common cause. Cashew nuts are a common cause.  Eggs are more common cause. More allergies are caused  by sea  food. Less allergies by chicken, mutton, etc.  So anything technically can cause an allergy.   Any substance that comes in contact with your immune system on the body can cause an  allergy. It may be a protein, carbohydrate, but more  commonly,  we  come across due to  allergies  due to protein  the vegetarian foods  other  than nuts, sometime certain pulses. <br />#FoodAllergy{% endraw %}
