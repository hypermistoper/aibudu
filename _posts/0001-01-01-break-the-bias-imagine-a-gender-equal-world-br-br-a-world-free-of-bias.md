{% raw %}Imagine a gender equal world.<br /><br />A world free of bias, stereotypes, and discrimination.<br /><br />A world that is diverse, equitable, and inclusive.<br /><br />A world where difference is valued and celebrated.<br /><br />Together we can forge women's equality.<br /><br />Collectively we can all #BreakTheBias<br /><br />Individually, we're all responsible for our own thoughts and actions - all day, every day.<br /><br />We can break the bias in our communities.<br /><br />We can break the bias in our workplaces.<br /><br />We can break the bias in our schools, colleges and universities.<br /><br />Together, we can all break the bias.<br /><br />Whether deliberate or unconscious, bias makes it difficult for women to move ahead. Knowing that bias exists isnâ€™t enough, action is needed to level the playing field.<br /><br />Are you in? Will you actively call out gender bias, discrimination and stereotyping each time you see it?<br /><br />Will you help break the bias?{% endraw %}
