{% raw %}On late night Wednesday 14 May 2014, few days before the European Parliament, County and Municipality elections that take place on Sunday May18th, a group of  15 anarchists in Vironas suburb of Athens was putting up anti-elections posters around the electoral kiosks of political candidates. Some of their self-described &quot;democrat&quot; voters called the police that ambushed the 15 anarchists with almost 10 police cars and a dozen police bikes. As it was obvious a fight broke out that led to the police kidnapping of 6 anarchists, showing that just few days before their democratic fun fare what democracy fears is exactly that, i.e. the antiauthoritarian context of freedom speech.<br /><br />Despite the late-night hour, shortly after 02:00 past midnight, 80-90 anarchists marched towards the local police station demanding the immediate release of the 6 arrested. While the police could not anticipate the solidarity reflexes, cause the incident happened in a small neighborhood and because of the late time, the policemen which were outnumbered reacted in panic, using even a water hose against those gathered, shouting in panic at those gathered to stay back, trying to gain time until the riot squads arrived in a hurry, that upon their arrival immediately began an attack with batons and flash-bang grenades in the quiet neighborhood of Vyron area. <br /><br />Despite the attack some of the protesters remained or came back to the police station forcing the police to free the 6 anarchists arrested 20 minutes later.
