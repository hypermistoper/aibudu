{% raw %}For a character with only one solo movie to his name, Doctor Strange's fingerprints are all over the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br /><br />After being introduced in 2016, he promptly became a major part of the franchise, appearing in &quot;Thor: Ragnarok,&quot; &quot;Avengers: Infinity War,&quot; &quot;Avengers: Endgame,&quot; and &quot;Spider-Man: No Way Home.&quot; (He even made a very brief appearance in &quot;Captain America: The Winter Soldier&quot; before officially being introduced.)<br /><br />Owing to his position as a powerful sorcerer, Doctor Strange's story is anything but simple. He's died dozens of times, traversed dimensions, met gods, fought unfathomable horrors â€“ and he's just getting started. As we wait for the release of &quot;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness,&quot; catch up on the story with Doctor Strange's entire MCU timeline explained.<br /><br />#DrStrange #MCU #Timeline<br /><br />The doctor is in | 0:00<br />Getting Strange | 1:19<br />Dark Dimension | 2:16<br />Asgardians | 3:18<br />The Infinity War | 4:18<br />Blipped | 5:15<br />Endgame | 6:07<br />Spider-Trouble | 7:16<br />What If? | 8:15<br />Into the Multiverse | 9:06<br /><br />Read Full Article: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.looper.com/811069/doctor-stranges-entire-timeline-in-the-mcu-explained/">https://www.looper.com/811069/doctor-stranges-entire-timeline-in-the-mcu-explained/</a>{% endraw %}
