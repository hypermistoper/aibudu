{% raw %}How much does it really cost to own and drive a car as your primary mode of transportation? Are the costs of driving an electric car competitive with driving an internal combustion engine powered vehicle, once you factor in all the different expenses? Regardless of what you drive, the costs go far beyond just what you use in gas or electricity every day.<br /><br />Gas prices are grabbing the headlines in 2022, but the costs of insurance, maintenance, and licensing and registration are significant too. This video will look at the true cost of driving, and how people misunderstand those costs when they're making the decision to drive on a day-to-day basis, or decisions on housing location or vehicle replacement on a macro time scale.<br /><br />Other CityNerd Videos referenced:<br />- Mexico City-Queretaro High Speed Rail Race: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/mvO4nH6pb1M">https://youtu.be/mvO4nH6pb1M</a><br />- Toronto-Montreal High Speed Rail Race: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/gZdnl7wEE9g">https://youtu.be/gZdnl7wEE9g</a><br />- Dallas-Houston High Speed Rail Race: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/Ci4SbjBnqkk">https://youtu.be/Ci4SbjBnqkk</a><br />- Los Angeles-San Francisco High Speed Rail Race: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/3Cvt8QA4SvY">https://youtu.be/3Cvt8QA4SvY</a><br />- Portland Bike vs Bus vs Car Race: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/-7UcvadTgac">https://youtu.be/-7UcvadTgac</a><br /><br />Resources:<br />- US Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Expenditure Survey <br /> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.bls.gov/cex/home.htm">https://www.bls.gov/cex/home.htm</a><br />- NYC Vision Zero View <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vzv.nyc/">https://vzv.nyc/</a><br />- Externalities of Driving graphic from <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/jonathan_maus/status/1504925573633609731?s=11">https://twitter.com/jonathan_maus/status/1504925573633609731?s=11</a><br />- &quot;Average Car Payment | Loan Statistics 2022&quot;
