{% raw %}And it's not just Ferrari, Red Bull have done it too!<br /><br />Join our F1 Mailing List! ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://driver61.beehiiv.com/subscribe">https://driver61.beehiiv.com/subscribe</a><br /><br />ðŸ”§ Thanks to Scarbs for joining us once again! Go follow him on Twitter for F1 Tech news! ðŸ‘‰ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/ScarbsTech">https://twitter.com/ScarbsTech</a><br /><br />Get ready, weâ€™re going to be getting nerdy about the Ferrari, Red Bull and Mercedes floors - so see how they are starting to get a handle on the bouncing. <br /><br />So this in Imola we got a look a look at the Red Bull and Mercedes floors from the garage, and Sainz gave us a look at the Ferrari after his spin in qualifying. <br /><br />There were some really interesting bits to break down, especially on the Red Bull. These bits are skids, and they could be the answer to the bouncing on the straights. <br /><br />So let's get into it. <br /><br />Now weâ€™re not going to break down wh6y porpoising is happening, but just know - it could be for a number of reasons. And this solution is only solving one of them, so fair warning.<br /><br />But a lot of this stems from the flexing of the floor. The cars are struggling to get down to the weight limit, and so you want to make the floor as light, and therefore thin as possible.<br /><br />So this means the floors are flexing as the downforce builds. And that can actually be a good thing - meaning you can control the airflow a little better and constricting the airflow can often be a good thing (in some cases).<br /><br />Because if the gap between the floor and the ground is smaller, you can accelerate the air more and create more downforce. <br /><br />âž¤Follow Driver61 on:<br />   âž¤ Instagram- @official_driver61 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/D61Insta">https://bit.ly/D61Insta</a><br />   âž¤TikTok - @official_driver61 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/D61TikTok">https://bit.ly/D61TikTok</a><br /><br />âž¤ Follow Scott on:<br />   âž¤ Twitter - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/scottkmansell">https://twitter.com/scottkmansell</a><br />   âž¤ Instagram - @official_driver61 - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/D61Insta">https://bit.ly/D61Insta</a><br /><br />âž¤ Follow Callum on:<br /> âž¤ TikTok - @callumraces <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tiktok.com/@callumraces">https://tiktok.com/@callumraces</a><br /> âž¤ Twitter - @callum_mcintyre <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/@callum_mcintyre">https://twitter.com/@callum_mcintyre</a><br /> âž¤ Instagram - @mcintyre.jpg <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/mcintyre.jpg/">https://www.instagram.com/mcintyre.jpg/</a><br /><br />#Formula1 #Ferrari #Driver61{% endraw %}
