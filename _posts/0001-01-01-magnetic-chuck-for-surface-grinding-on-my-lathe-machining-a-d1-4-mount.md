{% raw %}Machining a D1-4 mount for a magnetic chuck on my lathe so I can surface-grind thrust washers and other thin parts that are too hard to grip.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Includes a bonus ASMR segment!  That's the funny tingle in the top of your head that some folks get from watching a certain type of video. As usual, I'm rubbish at it of course.<br /><br /><br /><br />Aimee (my Artificially Intelligent Machining and Engineering Expert avatar) offers her criticism of my work and life choices, as usual.<br /><br /><br /><br />I faced the chuck to get the surface flat and perpendicular to the lathe spindle axis and tested machining of a sample of cold-rolled steel. I used the toolpost grinder I made to put a fine finish on the block and it worked pretty well.  <br /><br /><br /><br />For the avoidance of doubt, I covered the lathe ways and bearings and other sensitive bits very carefully, used a shop-vac to catch the grinding dust and sparks and cleaned the lathe very carefully after the work was complete.  I also wore a breathing mask, full-face helmet and crouched behind a polycarbonate plate while I was testing, so if you are Captain Obvious and feel the need to tell me I'm taking risks, please don't.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Attributions:<br /><br />Ajax Machine Tools <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPcYxCDimkA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPcYxCDimkA</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Cat Meme Aaron's Animals<br /><br /><br /><br />Till sound: Benboncan <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://freesound.org/people/Benboncan/sounds/91924/">https://freesound.org/people/Benboncan/sounds/91924/</a> <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</a><br /><br />00:00 Going Too Far<br />00:37 Thrust Washers Problem<br />01:12 Shopping<br />03:38 Spindle Nose Hygiene<br />06:13 Facing<br />13:18 Wiggler<br />16:02 Tapping<br />22:56 ASMR Segment<br />24:51 Runout<br />27:13 Grinding{% endraw %}
