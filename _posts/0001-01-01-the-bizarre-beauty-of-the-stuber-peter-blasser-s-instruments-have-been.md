{% raw %}Peter Blasser's Instruments have been central to my music and live performances for a long time. His Ciat-Lonbarde series is both mystifying and rewarding, balancing chaos and lush sound beautifully. With the Din Datin Dudero edition of oval instruments he has created something even more elusive: what looks like the result of a surfboard and a CDJ getting cozy in a woodshop, the Stuber stereo analog filter instrument is both intuitive and an enigma.<br /><br />I explored it over the course of ten days, writing 18 tracks for a new album with it as a center piece. I can't claim I am fully aware of how it works, mastery of it is something that needs a long time of practice, but I have fallen in love with it, like with all of Peter's instruments before. <br /><br />Pictures and information taken from:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.ciat-lonbarde.net/ddd/index.html">https://www.ciat-lonbarde.net/ddd/index.html</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://econtact.ca/17_4/blasser_ovalsynth.html">https://econtact.ca/17_4/blasser_ovalsynth.html</a><br /><br />HELP ME CREATE  &amp; GET STUFF:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://patreon.com/hainbach">http://patreon.com/hainbach</a><br />CHANNEL MEMBERSHIP: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeovElJP0n0i8ADaPsRSd8g/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeovElJP0n0i8ADaPsRSd8g/join</a><br />MY MUSIC: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://hainbach.bandcamp.com">http://hainbach.bandcamp.com</a><br />FASHION: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://teespring.com/de/stores/hainbach">http://teespring.com/de/stores/hainbach</a><br />CONNECT: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://reddit.com/r/hainbach">http://reddit.com/r/hainbach</a><br /><br />MY SIGNATURE SOFTWARE: <br />NOISES <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.audiothing.net/instruments/noises/">https://www.audiothing.net/instruments/noises/</a><br />GONG AMP <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.audiothing.net/effects/gong-amp/">https://www.audiothing.net/effects/gong-amp/</a><br />WIRES  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.audiothing.net/effects/wires/">https://www.audiothing.net/effects/wires/</a><br />MORPHING ROTOR <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.audiothing.net/effects/things-motor/">https://www.audiothing.net/effects/things-motor/</a><br />MELLOTRON <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.gforcesoftware.com/products/hainbach-artist-pack/">https://www.gforcesoftware.com/products/hainbach-artist-pack/</a><br />TEST EQUIPMENT LIBRARY <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/hainbach-landfill-totems">https://www.spitfireaudio.com/shop/a-z/hainbach-landfill-totems</a><br />LOOPER <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gauss-field-looper/id1530684073">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/gauss-field-looper/id1530684073</a><br /><br />BUY THE GEAR I USE (EU):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://redir.love/thocf/n2lm9oo2ym">https://redir.love/thocf/n2lm9oo2ym</a><br />BUY THE GEAR I USE (US):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3nsnE9Q">https://bit.ly/3nsnE9Q</a><br />(affiliate links, I get a few % if you buy through them)<br />BUY THE GEAR I USE (UK)<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://tidd.ly/36bwS5b">https://tidd.ly/36bwS5b</a>{% endraw %}
