Before we cut to the chase though, and I know I've mentioned this to you before, I just wanted to remind you to sign- up to our newsletter at Kamalifestyles so we can keep you updated on what we're all doing - that's myself, Annabella and Emre. And also, you will be the first to know about our latest offers, our exclusive videos, our special events, also on our exciting new products, our bootcamp locations and there's going to be much much more too. So definitely check out the link in the video's description, right down below. I'll also post a link in the comments section too in case you miss it.<br /><br />Alright so today I wanted to talk to you about becoming that ultimate ladies man with women. But first, let me show you a piece of infield footage of me in action, where I have a really good interaction with two girls I approached from the street. So let's watch the footage and let's see how it went with the girls!<br /><br />Hope you liked that. I have to say though it was really annoying I couldn't get the latter part of that interaction because it started to POUR down with rain, the sky literally opened up like it was a monsoon, it was unbelievable. But you get the general gist of it - the girls were really nice and we had a great time together. So what I wanted to talk to you about today is on becoming that ladies man with the girls. You basically want to get to the stage where you're simply irresistible when you're in their company, okay. You want to become irresistible when you're in the company of women in general. And you're drawing them in like a magnet. So how can we pull it off? How can an average guy make this a reality and go from where he is, all the way to becoming that hero?<br /><br />Well look, at the end of the day it all comes down to your beliefs, it all comes down to your internal beliefs, and how strongly you believe you can become that irresistible character. Because if you fully believe that you're a ladies' man, or that you can become that ladies man, then yeah of course it's going to happen. It's going to become a self- fulfilling prophecy and it's going to come true. But if you're a little bit unsure about yourself, if you sometimes doubt yourself and you doubt that you will ever make it to become that type of guy, then likewise it's not going to happen for you and you're going to fail. So it always comes down to how much you believe in yourself and how deep that belief's ingrained into you.<br /><br />Check out our Ebooks and Products at Kamalifestyles.com<br /><br />Ebooks are on sale at Kamalifestyles.com<br />How to Get Girls to Chase You<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kamalifestyles.com/products/how-to-get-girls-to-chase-you/">https://www.kamalifestyles.com/products/how-to-get-girls-to-chase-you/</a><br />Dating Guide for men<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.kamalifestyles.com/products/dating-guide-for-men/">http://www.kamalifestyles.com/products/dating-guide-for-men/</a><br />Become An Alpha Male<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.kamalifestyles.com/products/be-an-alpha-male/">http://www.kamalifestyles.com/products/be-an-alpha-male/</a><br />Carpe Diem<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kamalifestyles.com/products/carpe-diem/">https://www.kamalifestyles.com/products/carpe-diem/</a><br />Get Her Crazy In Bed<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kamalifestyles.com/products/get-her-crazy-in-bed/">https://www.kamalifestyles.com/products/get-her-crazy-in-bed/</a><br />Introverted Casanova<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kamalifestyles.com/products/introverted-casanova/">https://www.kamalifestyles.com/products/introverted-casanova/</a><br />Social Anxiety<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kamalifestyles.com/social-anxiety/">https://www.kamalifestyles.com/social-anxiety/</a><br />Conversation Hacks<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kamalifestyles.com/products/conversation-hacks/">https://www.kamalifestyles.com/products/conversation-hacks/</a><br />Confidence Booster<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.kamalifestyles.com/confidence-booster-programme/">https://www.kamalifestyles.com/confidence-booster-programme/</a><br /><br />Iain Myles is an executive dating coach of Kamalifestyles.
