{% raw %}An idea tested, but never put into service, was the flexible or inflated, air-cushioned, &quot;rubber deck&quot;. In the early jet age it was recognized that eliminating the landing gear for carrier borne aircraft would improve the flight performance and range, since the space taken by the landing gear could be used to hold additional fuel tanks. This led to the concept of a deck that would absorb the energy of landing.<br /><br />With the introduction of jet aircraft the risk of damaging propellers was no longer an issue, though take off would require some sort of launching cradle. Tests were carried out with a de Havilland Sea Vampire flown by test pilot Eric &quot;Winkle&quot; Brown onto a flexible deck fitted to HMS Warrior.<br /><br />The deck consisted of a rubberized sheet fully supported on multiple layers of pressurized fire hose. Supermarine designed its Type 508 for rubber deck landings. The flexible deck idea was found to be technically feasible but was abandoned, as the weight of carrier aircraft increased and there were always doubts about the ability of an average pilot to land in this way.{% endraw %}
