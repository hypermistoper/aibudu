{% raw %}Hi! New video - Train adventures at the railway station in the BeamNG.Drive game. This video contains various funny situations with trains that can happen at the railway station. Semaphores, railway crossings, buffer stops and working switches and, of course, train wrecks.<br />Thank you for watching! If you enjoyed this video, please click the like, leave a comment and subscribe to my channel.<br /><br />About the Game:<br />Beamng drive is a race car game that uses a soft-body physics engine. Every component of a Beam NG vehicle is simulated in real-time using mass points and beams. In addition, crashes feel realistic, as the game uses an incredibly accurate damage model. This early access game is not complete, but you can play it already now.<br /><br />Beamng drive mods: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.beamng.com/resources/">https://www.beamng.com/resources/</a>{% endraw %}
