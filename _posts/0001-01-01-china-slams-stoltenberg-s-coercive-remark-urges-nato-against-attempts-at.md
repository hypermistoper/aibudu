{% raw %}Xinhua News Agency: During the meetings of NATO Ministers of Foreign Affairs on April 6 and 7, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg accused China of “unwilling to condemn Russia’s aggression” against Ukraine. He said “Beijing has joined Moscow in questioning the right of nations to choose their own path. This is a serious challenge to us all.” NATO 2030, the new Strategic Concept, will for the first time take account of the systemic challenges to the security of democracies posed by China’s “growing influence and coercive policies”. What is China’s comment?<br /><br />Zhao Lijian: For some time, the NATO head has disregarded facts and confounded black with white when making groundless accusations, smears and attacks against China. He has made irresponsible comments on China’s foreign policies, touted the “China threat” and even used coercion on China recently. China deplores and firmly rejects this, and has made solemn representations with NATO for many times.<br /><br />As the largest military alliance born out of the Cold War, NATO has long adhered to the obsolete security concept, engaged in bloc confrontation according to the playbook of the old Cold War and reduced itself to some country’s tool for hegemony. While claiming to be a defensive organization, NATO has been constantly making trouble and confrontation in reality. While asking other countries to abide by the basic norms governing international relations, NATO has grossly waged wars against sovereign countries and firing shells indiscriminately that led to civilian deaths and displacement. NATO, a military organization in the North Atlantic, has journeyed to the Asia-Pacific to flex its muscles and provoke tensions in recent years. NATO has been transgressing regions and fields and clamoring for a new Cold War of bloc confrontation. This gives ample reason for high vigilance and firm opposition from the international community.<br /><br />China has always been a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development and a guardian of international order. We will steadfastly pursue the path for peaceful development. China’s development means opportunities for the world, instead of a threat to anyone. NATO should immediately stop spreading disinformation and provocative remarks targeting China, and abandon the confrontational approach of drawing ideological lines. NATO has disrupted Europe. It should stop trying to destabilize Asia and the whole world.<br /><br />__________________<br />Powered by Shanghai Media Group, ShanghaiEye focuses on producing top-quality content for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube.<br />Nobody knows Shanghai better than us.<br />Please subscribe to us  ☻☻☻<br />__________________<br />For more stories, please click <br />■ What's up today in Shanghai, the most updated news of the city<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MNjpE4hspSVry8dR555getN">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MNjpE4hspSVry8dR555getN</a><br />■ Amazing Shanghai, exploring the unknown corners of the city,  learning the people, food and stories behind them<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MMVTWr-zIXjsS4hhSQPmyes">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MMVTWr-zIXjsS4hhSQPmyes</a><br />■ What Chinese people's lives are like during the post COVID-19 period<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MPrPTmIirpfgETu6VKVESXe">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MPrPTmIirpfgETu6VKVESXe</a><br />■ Views of foreign scholars on China and its affairs<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MO9ua_nSK6slRPdUl-ovjRe">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MO9ua_nSK6slRPdUl-ovjRe</a><br />■ Foreign faces in Shanghai, people living in this city sharing their true feelings<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MP0vJDSw23_1MCPJhAfGbiG">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MP0vJDSw23_1MCPJhAfGbiG</a><br />■ Mini-docs showing why China is the country it is today <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MOreRu2AbZ3ziIUyCcdBLwX">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MOreRu2AbZ3ziIUyCcdBLwX</a><br />__________________<br />☎Leave us messages if you have any suggestions or questions!<br />Thank you!{% endraw %}
