{% raw %}Weekly Ammo Hunt - Ammo Shortage in 2022? Low Ammo prices? Were back doing our ammo hunts and this is the first hunt of 2022! In this week's ammo hunt we travel to Cabela's, and Academy to see if the ammo shortage is truly over in Houston. We found a few stashes of Monarch 243, 270, 30-30, and 30-06 hunting ammo. 6.5 Creedmoor ammo was everywhere both Hornady and Federal. 9mm ammo was also everywhere we went in large quantities. What does the ammo look like in your state?<br /><br />#ammoshortage<br />#ammohunt<br />#ammoscore<br /><br />BUSINESS INQUIRIES: cr42hunting@yahoo.com<br />SUBSCRIBE HERE: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/3ipz6PW">https://bit.ly/3ipz6PW</a> <br />SWAG: Get your CR42 Hunting merch here <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cr42-hunting.creator-spring.com/">https://cr42-hunting.creator-spring.com/</a> <br />OUR CAMERA: GoPro HERO9 here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/38W5aaV">https://amzn.to/38W5aaV</a><br /> <br />SOCIAL MEDIA:<br />Our website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://cr42hunting.com/">https://cr42hunting.com/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/cr42hunting/">https://www.instagram.com/cr42hunting/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/Cr42Hunting">https://twitter.com/Cr42Hunting</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/CR42hunting">https://www.facebook.com/CR42hunting</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMERS:<br />Safety Disclaimer: CR42 Hunting videos are filmed on a private shooting range in a controlled setting under the supervision of trained professionals.
