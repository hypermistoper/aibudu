{% raw %}Iven Ebener, Brendan Fairclough and myself set out on a normal day in the UK to ride some sunny trails just outside of Donnington here in the UK.  Unfortunately we we're met by a weather system uncompatible with jeans, cycling and filming.  This resulted in arguably some of my finest work as Iven and myself battled through the conditions on our Focus JamÂ² and Brendan on his Scott EMTB.<br /><br /><br />Podcast latest episode can be found here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1aNP...">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1aNP...</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Make sure you subscribe to the Ride Companion channel tooo!<br /><br />ALSO!
