{% raw %}Tonight we explore the well known Naka Market otherwise Known as the weekend Variety Market which is situated just outside of Phuket Town on Naka Rd.<br />Over the last two years, this market has undergone some changes including a new car and motorbike parking area, A second food court and even a small skate park.<br /><br />Naka Market for a long time has been known as the largest market in here Phuket but because of recent changes, it has actually shrunk in size so I'm not sure it still holds this title. The market offers a very wide choice of goods so if you are looking for something, in particular, you should be able to find it here plus there's a large food area which makes this a great place to spend an evening but remember this is a weekend market. <br /><br />Saturdays and Sundays Only.  Start's around 4pm.<br /><br />Location: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/maps/AaAjEXA33h3WpHSm8">https://goo.gl/maps/AaAjEXA33h3WpHSm8</a><br /><br /><br />So go grab yourself a drink and join me as we take a walk around this very interesting weekend market.<br />No-Nonsense Guide Phuket &amp; Beyond.<br /><br />Phuket 2022 Thailand.<br />Phuket Raw &amp; No-Nonsense Guide Phuket 2022.<br /><br />Email: thailandtonyonly@gmail.com<br /><br />Facebook Group: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/856167797925184">https://www.facebook.com/groups/856167797925184</a> <br /><br />Tumblr: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thailandtony.tumblr.com/">https://thailandtony.tumblr.com/</a><br /><br />You can Show your Love &amp; Support for the Channel @ <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://paypal.me/thailandtony">https://paypal.me/thailandtony</a><br /><br />Thank You, Tony, üëç{% endraw %}
