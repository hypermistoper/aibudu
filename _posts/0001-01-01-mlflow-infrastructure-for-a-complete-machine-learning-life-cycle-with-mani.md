{% raw %}ML development brings many new complexities beyond the traditional software development lifecycle. Unlike in traditional software development, ML developers want to try multiple algorithms, tools, and parameters to get the best results, and they need to track this information to reproduce work. In addition, developers need to use many distinct systems to productionize models. To address these problems, many companies are building custom “ML platforms” that automate this lifecycle, but even these platforms are limited to a few supported algorithms and to each company’s internal infrastructure.<br /><br /> <br /><br />In this session, we introduce MLflow, a new open source project from Databricks that aims to design an open ML platform where organizations can use any ML library and development tool of their choice to reliably build and share ML applications. MLflow introduces simple abstractions to package reproducible projects, track results, and encapsulate models that can be used with many existing tools, accelerating the ML lifecycle for organizations of any size.<br /><br />In this deep-dive session, through a complete ML model life-cycle example, you will walk away with:<br /><br />MLflow concepts and abstractions for models, experiments, and projects<br />How to get started with MLFlow<br />Understand aspects of MLflow APIs<br />Using tracking APIs during model training<br />Using MLflow UI to visually compare and contrast experimental runs with different tuning parameters and evaluate metrics<br />Package, save, and deploy an MLflow model<br />Serve it using MLflow REST API<br />What’s next and how to contribute<br /><br />About: Databricks provides a unified data analytics platform, powered by Apache Spark™, that accelerates innovation by unifying data science, engineering and business.<br />Read more here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://databricks.com/product/unified-data-analytics-platform">https://databricks.com/product/unified-data-analytics-platform</a><br /><br />Connect with us:<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://databricks.com">https://databricks.com</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/databricksinc">https://www.facebook.com/databricksinc</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/databricks">https://twitter.com/databricks</a><br />LinkedIn: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/databricks">https://www.linkedin.com/company/databricks</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/databricksinc/">https://www.instagram.com/databricksinc/</a> Databricks is proud to announce that Gartner has named us a Leader in both the 2021 Magic Quadrant for Cloud Database Management Systems and the 2021 Magic Quadrant for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms.
