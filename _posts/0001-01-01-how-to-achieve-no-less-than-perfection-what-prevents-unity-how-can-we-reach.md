{% raw %}What prevents unity? How can we reach perfection? What happens when individuals start to change themselves? What is the most difficult step toward unity? What is the relation between love and hate? How can egoistic human beings partake in perfection?<br /><br />Without the ego, there would be unity. All that prevents unity is the desire to aim things back at ourselves.<br /><br />Other than the point of view that is holding onto the tool we were given—our desire to receive—using it in a direct form, other than that everything is in perfection.<br /><br />Unity and perfection are the same. The love of others is the same as not having the individual, separated point of view as my primary identity. We cannot reach unity, perfection, and love of others without an inner change.<br /><br />Still, we affect each other as we are not individuals. So once I start to change myself I recognize that other people are doing this too. Eventually, the barrier between my ego and the ego of another person drops and we stop identifying ourselves with the ego and start relating to each other without the ego.<br /><br />That is already a greater force of light in the world, helping others also in this and then more egoistic barriers drop until a natural change occurs and the soul, the true creature that was created, starts to experience itself as the whole.<br /><br />The first step—overcoming the inability to understand what is blocking our view outside of the ego—is the hardest. After taking this first step the forces merge, building a great momentum, and then everything else changes.<br /><br />There cannot be love without hate opposite it. Love exists above hate. It requires disconnection due to the ego. Otherwise, we would be unable to taste, feel or see the superior power of bestowal. We would not be able to feel it unless we had the strong contrast of hate.<br /><br />We are the opposite quality to “love” and this opposite quality limits and determines our perception of reality.<br /><br />Kabbalah is about how we can work with desire and intention. We can then use the matter of the creature, the desire to receive, by turning our intention that leads the desire from reception into a form of bestowal.<br /><br />By doing so, our perception of reality begins to change. The methodology is about how to turn this quality in order to partake in perfection.<br /><br />--- <br /><br />►Join KabU - Start your FREE 14-DAY trial. <br />Gain access to ALL KabU courses, live events, and student forums.
