/>Lyrics:<br /><br />Ooh<br />Ooh<br />Tried calling yesterday but got your voicemail again<br />Rushed over to your Uni hall, saw her leaving your place<br />You said you fucked up on a night out<br />You drank way too much, you're feeling bad now<br />You're tryna figure out how to worm your way out<br />Well, look at what you've done<br />You said you'd never do<br />You fucked it for yourself<br />This is the end of me and you<br />So don't call this number anymore<br />'Cause I won't be there for you like I was before<br />I should of listened to my friends<br />They always know best<br />They said you were just like all the rest, so<br />I'll sing it loud in case you don't already know<br />Pack up your shit and go, go, go, go<br />Go, go, go, go<br />Pack up your shit and go, go, go, go<br />Go, go, go, go<br />You said it was a one time thing<br />You don't know what you were thinking<br />That it didn't mean a thing<br />You promise it won't happen again<br />So when you get fucked up on a night out<br />How many times have you played around?<br />Was a fool, didn't see the signs<br />I guess my friends were always right<br />Well, look at what you've done<br />You said you'd never do<br />You fucked it for yourself<br />This is the end of me and you<br />So don't call this number anymore<br />'Cause I won't be there for you like I was before<br />I should of listened to my friends<br />They always know best<br />They said you were just like all the rest, so<br />I'll sing it loud in case you don't already know<br />Pack up your shit and go, go, go, go<br />Go, go, go, go<br />Pack up your shit and go, go, go, go<br />Go, go, go, go<br />I can't trust you anymore<br />Look what you've done<br />You've turned this heart cold<br />And I don't know if I can love again<br />But I know for sure we can't be friends<br />This is the end<br />Stop calling this number anymore<br />'Cause I won't be there for you like I was before<br />I should of listened to my friends<br />They always know best<br />They said you were just like all the rest, so<br />I'll sing it loud in case you don't already know<br />Pack up your shit and go, go, go, go (go)<br />Go, go, go, go (go)<br />Go, go, go, go<br />Go, go, go, go (I should of listened to my friends)<br />Go, go, go, go ('cause they always know best)<br />Go, go, go, go, uh<br />I'll sing it loud in case you don't already know<br />Pack up your shit and go{% endraw %}
