{% raw %}As a doctor training to be a Psychiatrist, most in the field would advise Dr. Jake Goodman NOT to post this. But he didn't join this field to continue the status quo. Thus, he posted this on social media in December of 2021: “My name is Dr. Jake, I'm a resident physician who treats mental illness, and I take medication for my mental health. And by the way, I'm proud of it.” Within 24 hours it had been seen by millions of people around the world. So why did Dr. Jake post this?  Dr. Jake Goodman, MD, MBA is a psychiatry resident doctor, mental health activist, and content creator with over 1.7 million followers on his social media channels. As someone who has personally experienced mental health issues, Jake uses his platform to advocate for mental health, reduce stigma and discrimination, and empower those experiencing mental health challenges to seek help. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.
