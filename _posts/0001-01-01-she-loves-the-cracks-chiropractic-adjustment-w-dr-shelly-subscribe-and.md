Thanks for watching!üíú<br /><br />‚≠êÔ∏èThe chiropractic adjustment in this video is considered a &quot;routine&quot; or &quot;follow-up&quot; visit. Generally, these types of visits are shorter visits because the patient does not need many additional therapies. Many of my patients come to see me for regular chiropractic adjustments like<br />this one even when they're not in pain. Remember, pain is usually the last symptom to show up when there is a problem and the first symptom to resolve after receiving treatment, but it isn't always the best indicator of whether or not you're completely healed. And it's not the only indicator<br />of whether or not you need an adjustment. A better way to determine if someone needs an adjustment is by checking the range of motion of their joints. If we can keep the joints moving properly, then the body can function and adapt to stress better, which decreases the risk of pain and health problems in the future.‚≠êÔ∏è<br /><br />Connect with me on Instagram ‚û°Ô∏è<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://instagram.com/drshel">https://instagram.com/drshel</a><br /><br />Like this video?
