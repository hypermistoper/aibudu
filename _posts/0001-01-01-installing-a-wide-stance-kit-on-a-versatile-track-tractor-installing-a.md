{% raw %}Installing a WIDE STANCE Kit on a Versatile Track Tractor<br /><br />In this video I am at Versatile Dealer Ziegler Cat in Wilma Minnesota as they are installing an optional WIDE STANCE kit that is available for all Versatile Delta Track Tractors. In the video I talk about the tractor and show the process of what's involved to install the kit. We also drive the tractor around the dealers lot. Hope to make it back when these tractors are running in the field.{% endraw %}
