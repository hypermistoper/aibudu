{% raw %}In this video, I attempted to try and set a lap time around the red bull ring in Austria that was quicker than the lap time set by Jarno Opmeer in the qualifying session from the 2021 F1 esports pro championship. I did many laps in f1 2021 time trials using a new Austria setup to try and do a hotlap that was quicker than Jarno Opmeer's time of a 1:03.251. Did I manage to beat it? Watch to find out ;)<br /><br />For more daily F1 2021 clips of me crashing, pulling off beautiful overtakes and raging over online players, subscribe!{% endraw %}
