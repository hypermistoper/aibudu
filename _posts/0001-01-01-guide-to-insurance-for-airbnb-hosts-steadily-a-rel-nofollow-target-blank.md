Airbnb itself offers some protection for its host community through its AirCover program; however, this does not guarantee coverage for all perils and unexpected circumstances that can occur. <br /><br />The traditional options for Airbnb hosts include homeowners insurance, renters insurance, landlord insurance, and commercial property insurance. In this video, we explore these four options and detail what coverage they offer and for whom.<br /><br />Airbnb hosts also need to consider any additional insurance and endorsements they need on top of their traditional policies. AirCover offers protection from damages caused by guests, but damages caused when the property is sitting vacant may exceed traditional policy limits. Some hosts thus may benefit from an umbrella policy—which extends liability coverage—or from an add-on endorsement such as earthquake, flood, or mold coverage. <br /><br />As the owner of a rental property, you can never be too careful when it comes to who stays in your home. Even the best of guests can cause damages that you will need to repair. While AirCover offers suitable coverage for interior damages and some liability protection, it’s not enough to rely on all-year round. When your house sits vacant in between guests, you’ll want an insurance policy to protect your property.<br /><br />For Airbnb rentals, we recommend speaking with your insurance provider. Many landlord insurance policies will not cover short-term rentals of under thirty days. If you have a renter in mind who will stay more than a month consecutively on your property, landlord insurance could be right for you. At Steadily, we offer landlord insurance for all types of homes and properties. Whether your Airbnb is an apartment in Chicago or a beach house in Florida, we’ve got you covered.<br /><br />Visit Steadily.com/airbnb to get a quote today.{% endraw %}
