{% raw %}original verification video by Rin: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/AAzRmUKMnOk">https://youtu.be/AAzRmUKMnOk</a><br />ID: 52113279<br />pass: 474969<br /><br />It's finally out! Big shoutout to Rin for verifying this for me, it probably would've take like another year if I had to do it myself. I still want to beat it eventually, so I'm going to keep practicing but it feels great to be relieved of the pressure and to finally get it released. Also, once again shoutouts to 4cat for the song, it's honestly a work of art. Do yourself a favour and listen to his other music as well, even though he isn't active on NG anymore.<br />song: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/691570">https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/691570</a><br /><br />discord: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/EVDrxK8">https://discord.gg/EVDrxK8</a><br />twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/where_win">https://twitter.com/where_win</a><br />twitch: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/wherwin">https://www.twitch.tv/wherwin</a>{% endraw %}
