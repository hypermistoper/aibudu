{% raw %}What you should do if you are struggling to find your life purpose and still have not figured what you should do.<br /><br /><br /><br />In this video coaching newsletter I discuss four different emails from four different viewers. The first email is from a viewer who sufferers from anxiety, depression, OCD and hypochondria due to growing up in a chaotic household. He asks for help to deal with stress and the fact success often feels hopeless. The second is a question from a YouTube commenter who says he doesn’t know what he loves to do because he never stays passionate about anything for very long. The third email is from a viewer who is getting a PHD in physics and doesn’t even know why he’s in school. The fourth email is from a guy who has an opportunity for a six figure salary in the family business, but has to stay in a small town that doesn’t excite him, or he could take a sales job for significantly less and live anywhere he wants to.<br /><br /><br /><br />“We work hardest at things we love and enjoy. Loving what you do causes you to obsess over it and put in the extra time required to become exceptional at it. When you become exceptional at doing things you love and enjoy, other people will notice. Exceptional people create their own luck because opportunities find them due to the fact they are better at their job than all others who simply like their job or do it because it pays the bills. Accomplishing your grandest goals and dreams is a process that is the result of a life’s work that lights you up on the inside with a fire to succeed. In professional sports, the best players are the ones who are the most obsessed with improving and out performing their peers, despite the fact everyone they compete against has talent. Learning to trust your intuition, heart, and curiosity and most importantly, acting upon them, is what enables you to accomplish your purpose and reach your full potential.” ~ Coach Corey Wayne <br /><br /><br />Click the link below to read the article “Life Purpose: The Only Way Out Is Through” on my website:<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://understandingrelationships.com/life-purpose-the-only-way-out-is-through/39144">https://understandingrelationships.com/life-purpose-the-only-way-out-is-through/39144</a><br /><br />If you have not read my book, “How To Be A 3% Man” yet, that would be a good starting place for you.
