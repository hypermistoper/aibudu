{% raw %}Polynomial Part -1 (link) -  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/u8SbuwmQIvk">https://youtu.be/u8SbuwmQIvk</a><br />The remainder theorem is a formula that is used to find the remainder when a polynomial is divided by a linear polynomial. When a certain number of things are divided into groups with an equal number of things in each group, the number of leftover things is known as the remainder. It is something that &quot;remains&quot; after division. Let us learn the concept of the remainder theorem.{% endraw %}
