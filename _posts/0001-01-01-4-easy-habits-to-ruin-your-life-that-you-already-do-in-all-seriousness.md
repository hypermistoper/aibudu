{% raw %}In all seriousness,<br /><br />do the opposite.<br /><br />The world needs more smart, disciplined, and healthy individuals. We have more food than ever, but less control over its consumption. We have more information than ever but less will and patience to learn it. Do everything opposite mentioned in the video, practice discipline, learn to create instead of just consuming mindlessly, and be healthy and fit. Internalize wisdom from the ancient Stoics, and become the best version you can possibly be. Help yourself, and with it, help the world as well.<br /><br />Other videos you might want to watch:<br />Fall asleep faster and be more alert: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDXD-VTtmdw">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDXD-VTtmdw</a><br />Build better habits and break bad ones: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/ejhPnfpqRTE">https://youtu.be/ejhPnfpqRTE</a><br /><br />Socials:<br />Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/ProjectBetterSelf">https://www.patreon.com/ProjectBetterSelf</a><br />IG: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/projectbetterself/">https://www.instagram.com/projectbetterself/</a><br /><br />Thank you!<br /><br /><br /><br />If you want to be financially independent, learn new skills faster, be charismatic and likable, obtain life changing habits, learn how to read faster, become confident, inspire people - then subscribe and join us for weekly YouTube training videos.<br /><br /><br /><br />SUBMIT YOUR NEXT VIDEO IDEA/REQUEST<br /><br />1.
