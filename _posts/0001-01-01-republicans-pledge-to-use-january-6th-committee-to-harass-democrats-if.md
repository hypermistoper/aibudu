{% raw %}Rather than shutting down the January 6th Committee if they win in the midterms, pro-Trump Republican lawmakers are now saying that they will simply use the committee to harass Democrats instead. Both Matt Gaetz and Madison Cawthorn say that they want to stack the Committee with Republicans and then make it start investigating Democrats. But both of these men might not even make it to the general election considering the legal problems they could be facing. Ring of Fire's Farron Cousins explains what's going on. <br /><br />Link - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.rawstory.com/republican-investigation-jan-6/">https://www.rawstory.com/republican-investigation-jan-6/</a><br /><br />Become a member today!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYWIEbibRcZav6xMLo9qWWw/join</a><br /><br />Support us by becoming a monthly patron on Patreon, and help keep progressive media alive!: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire">https://www.patreon.com/TheRingofFire</a><br /><br />Find our merchandise at Teespring: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store">https://teespring.com/stores/rof-store</a><br /><br />Spread the word!

Which of course is why the committee says, hey, we're gonna rush things. Try to get it done by summertime for you. Well, I guess in a way to ease my fears, several Republicans have come out recently telling us that they're not gonna disband the committee. The committee's gonna keep doing some really good work. And that would make me feel better if the work the committee was gonna be doing under Republican rule wasn't to just harass and intimidate Democrats. Matt Gaetz had this to say. I don't think we can disband the January 6th committee. I think we have to take over the January 6th committee. Madison Cawthorn added, there are so many questions that are unanswered that people would like to have an answer to when it comes to January 6th.<br /><br />Of course, he's not talking about the Republican involvement. He's not talking about lawmakers working with Trump to overthrow the election. No, no, no. What they're getting at is why didn't the Democrats stop January 6th? Why didn't Nancy Pelosi have the Capitol police, who she doesn't have control over, stop the rioters? That's what they want to do and of course they want to ask the committee to look into things like Hunter, like Hunter Biden's laptop. They've, they've made that clear over the last few weeks. So that's what the select committee would become. But I do think it's worth pointing out that the two most vocal people here, Matt Gaetz and Madison Cawthorn, both of them might not even be on the ballot this year. One, because Madison Cawthorn over in North Carolina is facing a pretty stiff challenge to his candidacy in court. So legally speaking, he may not even be allowed onto the ballot.<br /><br />Matt Gaetz, well, he may be indicted by then. I think he will be indicted by then, at which point, I don't think he's going to continue to be running for office, because he's probably gonna have bigger problems to face, right? So both of these two individuals that are talking about weaponizing the January 6th committee against the Democratic party, both of them are, I wouldn't say extremely unlikely to even be in Congress next year, but I'm going to say there's a, there's a good chance both of them could not be in Congress next year. But of course that all is, you know, the sideshow. The big thing is, yeah, Republicans have made it clear whether it's through the January 6th committee or just through new committees they form, or just through acts of Congress, they're going to use the next two years if they take back the House, trying to make Democrats lives miserable. You know, they're gonna launch investigations. They said they wanna look into Afghanistan, go for it. I don't care. I'm not somebody that's gonna get bent outta shape.<br /><br />I do think any investigation they launch is probably gonna be stupid and a waste of time. But if that's how they choose to spend their time, then that's also time that they're not putting forth national legislation to ban books or national legislation to ban transgender athletes. And I'm okay if they say, stay distracted with stupid stuff instead of inflicting real harm on the American public. Because as we've seen at the state level.{% endraw %}
