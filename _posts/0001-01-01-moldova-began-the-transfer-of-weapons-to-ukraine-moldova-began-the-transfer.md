{% raw %}Moldova began the transfer of weapons to Ukraine.<br />Moldova has opened corridors for the supply of weapons to Ukraine.<br />The authorities of Moldova provided Ukraine with their territory for the transfer of Western weapons. Deliveries, most likely, will be carried out from the territory of Romania, however, earlier the Moldovan authorities stated that they did not intend to assist NATO countries in any way in the supply of weapons to Ukraine. Provided information on this Chairman of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine Ruslan Stefanchuk.<br />â€œI am glad to meet in Kyiv with the Head of the Parliament of Moldova, Igor Grosu! We discussed the transfer of military equipment to Ukraine, assistance in demining the liberated territories and the imposition of sanctions against Russia.<br />Experts note that Moldova's contribution to the arming of Ukraine can lead to extremely serious consequences for this European country, since Russia can regard this not only as provocative actions, but also mark Chisinau's position as unfriendly, and this can already lead to an extremely serious crisis.<br />The Moldovan authorities have not officially commented on the supply of weapons to Ukraine, however, given the fact that Moldova does not have its own army, we are probably talking about the supply of Western weapons through the territory of this state.<br /><br /><br />IMPORTANT! <br />-None of these images, music &amp; video clips were created/owned by us. -This video is purely fan-made, if you (owners) have seen your content and want to remove this video, please message us privately or mail us<br />saimircarciu91@gmail.com<br />before doing anything.
