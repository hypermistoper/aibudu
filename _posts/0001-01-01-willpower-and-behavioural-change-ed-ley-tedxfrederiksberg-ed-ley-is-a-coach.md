{% raw %}Ed Ley is a coach that uses the science of behavioral change to help CEO’s, leaders and high level performers to ditch the old idea of will power and manning up for goal achievement.  He teaches them how to work with the brain to create excellence, energy and enjoyment both for themselves and within their businesses. Ed is a speaker, author, and owner of Absolute Health in Hellerup. He moved to Copenhagen just over 2.5 years ago with his wife and two daughters for an adventure. He has since met over 500 people for coffee, been featured in Aktiv Magazine and hosts The Global Denmark podcast  interviewing over 50 leader, politicians, best-selling authors and public figures. He loves it.   Ed Ley is a coach that uses the science of behavioral change to help CEO’s, leaders and high level performers to ditch the old idea of will power and manning up for goal achievement.
