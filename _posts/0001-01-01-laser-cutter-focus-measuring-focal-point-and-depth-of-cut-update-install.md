{% raw %}Update: Install lens with curved side up! I get confused and say it wrong in the video.<br /><br />To get a good cut or engraving you need to know where you laser is focusing correctly. Here is a method to check the true focal point of your laser head and determine the potential depth of cut.<br /><br />Prefer to read?
