What is new on diastolic dysfunction? How have the guidelines changed? What is the role of echocardiography in general? When should you use tissue Doppler? What is the role of E/E´? How do you grade the severity of diastolic dysfunction? Should we still use the term “Pseudonormal filling pattern”? How to estimate filling pressures. Which approach do you choose in patients with reduced left ventricular function? Professor Thomas Binder and  Dr. Martin Genger discuss diastolic dysfunction and answer questions of &quot;123sonography members” during an interactive Webinar.{% endraw %}
