We could say it is an orphan.<br />However, even if there is no star lighting it up, the sky is not as dark as it may seem. <br />Bright flashes light it up every now and then. This rogue planet is 12 times more massive than Jupiter, and its magnetic field is 200 times more powerful, and this is what creates such amazing phenomena, like, for example, northern lights. <br />In this video, you will find out how a planet can be ice cold and extremely hot at the same time, and that there are planets in which rain falls upside down. <br /><br />And, most importantly, we will understand that we live in a crazy, beautiful universe. <br /><br />- -<br />&quot;If You happen to see any content that is yours, and we didn't give credit in the right manner please let us know at Lorenzovareseaziendale@gmail.com and we will correct it immediately&quot;<br /><br />&quot;Some of our visual content is under an Attribution-ShareAlike license.
