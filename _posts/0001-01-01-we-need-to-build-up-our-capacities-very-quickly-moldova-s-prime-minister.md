{% raw %}Moldova's Prime Minister Natalita Gavrilita spoke with DW ahead of a donor conference and said that besides the parties to the conflict, Moldova is the country most affected by the war. &quot;About 15% of our trade was with Ukraine and Russia and Belarus. The Odesa port was a very important logistics port,&quot; the prime minister said. These come on top of other issues also seen in other European countries such as rising energy costs and high inflation which has &quot;already reached 18% in Moldova.&quot; Gavrilita said that more than 400,000 people have already fled Ukraine into Moldova, of which 100,000 have decided to stay. &quot;At a stable population of around 2.7 million, this represents more than 3% of our population, almost 4%,&quot; she said, adding that most of the refugees were vulnerable people in need of aid. Moldova is also dealing with a separatist region along the border with Ukraine — Transnistria — where Russian troops have been stationed. Gavrilita said Moldova is &quot;concerned&quot; about their presence, but added that they have not seen &quot;any specific plans or movements&quot; that indicate those forces would engage in the war in Ukraine.<br /><br />Subscribe: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1">https://www.youtube.com/user/deutschewelleenglish?sub_confirmation=1</a><br /><br />For more news go to: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.dw.com/en/">http://www.dw.com/en/</a><br />Follow DW on social media:<br />►Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/">https://www.facebook.com/deutschewellenews/</a><br />►Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/dwnews">https://twitter.com/dwnews</a><br />►Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dwnews">https://www.instagram.com/dwnews</a><br />Für Videos in deutscher Sprache besuchen Sie: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch">https://www.youtube.com/dwdeutsch</a><br />#Moldova #Russia #Ukraine{% endraw %}
