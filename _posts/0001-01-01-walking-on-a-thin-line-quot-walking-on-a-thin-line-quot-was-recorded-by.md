{% raw %}&quot;Walking on a Thin Line&quot; was recorded by Huey Lewis and the News and is the fifth song on their 1984 release...Sports. The song is about both Vietnam soldiers and veterans...how the war weighed on their mind during combat...and the demons they would unknowingly confront upon their return home to the United States.<br /><br />Vietnam soldiers were treated with such disrespect and not awarded the honor they should have been given for participating in a war that a majority of America objected to. Examples of this outcasting can be seen in the lines &quot;Don't you know me I'm the boy next door...The one you find so easy to ignore&quot; as well as &quot;Straight off the front line...Labeled as freaks loose on the streets of the city&quot;. In reality, these were just boys who simply enlisted in the armed services or were called to duty as part of the Draft Lottery of 1969. For the most part, they &quot;Taught me how to shoot to kill&quot; and became &quot;A specialist with a deadly skill&quot;...and all along this was merely &quot;A skill I needed to have to be a survivor&quot;.These guys didn't start or ask to be in a war the public would never accept...and never deserved to be treated as criminals come the wars end.&quot;Walking on a Thin Line&quot; peaked at number 18 on the Billboard 100 of 1984 (the only single from the album not to reach the top ten) and was received with mixed thoughts by the public...drawing a strong parallel to the war in which it is about.{% endraw %}
