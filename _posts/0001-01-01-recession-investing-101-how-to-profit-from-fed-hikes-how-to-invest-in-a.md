What does this mean? How does this affect you? And what should we be investing in during these uncertain times to make the most amount of money possible? <br /><br />So the first thing we need to understand is why the fed just raised interest rates. Well as some of you may very well know, inflation in the U.S is out of control. The CPI numbers for February, which is the Consumer Price Index rose to 7.9% propelled by surging costs for gas, food and housing. Rising inflation makes you poorer basically because the money that you have and earn becomes less and less valuable. To combat this, we need to figure out ways to reduce spending, because the less we spend, the less demand for goods and services there is. The less demand, the more prices come down. One of the ways we can do this is by affectively decreasing the amount of cheap money there is in the economy - Ok so how do we do that? Well we start by making access to money more expensive. When borrowing money becomes more expensive, then less people will borrow money - and with less money out there the better it will be for inflation. <br /><br />the federal reserve has stepped in and decided itâ€™s going to raise interest rates by a quarter of a percent and will continue to do so over the next few years. Remember, higher interest rates means itâ€™s more expensive to borrow money and this in turn will help level out inflation but the real question is how do higher interest rates affect you? The first thing to look at is credit cards - the backbone of America. Because interest rates will affect the interest paid for debt then you can see how this will affect the debt we all use every day with credit cards. Interest on your credit cards are variable - which means they can change - and they increase and decrease based off of the overall interest rate environment. Watch video for what the best thing to do is. <br /><br />The second thing interest rate hikes will affect is your personal savings. See when interest rates are low you have no incentive to keep money in a savings account and fixed income like bonds. When interest rates go up it will have the opposite affect - leading you to save more, spend less and is another component in helping the overall inflation situation. This idea can trickle into investments as well - when we have low interest rates money moves out of fixed income and moves into riskier investments for potentially higher returns. So money piles into the stock market and the asses class rises. When interest rates rise, growth stocks tend to fall off because of the effects of a slowing down economy. When you spend less on goods and services this affects the profits of companies and when growth companies that trade at a high multiple or P/E ratio stop posting higher earnings investors say - hmm well this company isnâ€™t worth such a high multiple - itâ€™s overvalued - and boom there is a sell off. How can I profit from this? (Full details in video)<br /><br />will rising interest rates lead us into a recession. Many fear that it will because if interest rates rise too high or too fast, that will actually cause the economy instead of slowing down to come to a halt and even reverse. If they are not raised enough then inflation will spiral out of control- so there is a delicate balance that needs to happen to ride this out smoothly. A recession is a period of declining economic growth typically recognized as two consecutive quarters of decreasing GDP.<br /><br />So what should I be investing in?
