{% raw %}Here is the song I wrote inspired by the issues of Social justice which is the topic on the lips of everyone in the world today. I drew Inspiration from the words of the Late Civil Rights Icon John Lewis. As the world deals with the issues of a global pandemic , the issues of corruption, nepotism, racism, discrimination, liars and hypocrites continues to plague almost all the countries in the world today. Don't turn a blind eye when you see something that is wrong say something but most of all do something . Every little helps. Please share the link on your social media. Let's spread the word and see if the world can finally address these Global issues. As the lyrics Say &quot; Silence is not an Option&quot; Play your part.<br /><br />Listen On Spotify<br /><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6Xv0zha1jO2tKtEzA1hY62">https://open.spotify.com/album/6Xv0zha1jO2tKtEzA1hY62</a><br /><br />Please follow me on:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0VzKQfaNleslIB7qfZScI1">https://open.spotify.com/artist/0VzKQfaNleslIB7qfZScI1</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://music.apple.com/tr/artist/low-deep-t/459058089">https://music.apple.com/tr/artist/low-deep-t/459058089</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/lowdeeptofficial">https://www.facebook.com/lowdeeptofficial</a><br /><br />#johnlewis #silenceisnotanoption #lowdeept #saynotoracism # #blacklivesmatter{% endraw %}
