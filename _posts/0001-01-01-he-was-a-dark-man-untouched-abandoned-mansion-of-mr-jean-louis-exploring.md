{% raw %}Exploring abandoned places is my hobby and finance it all out of my own pocket and the donations I get from the people who love watching the documentaries we make... A small donation would be greatly appreciated! ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/brosofdecay">https://www.patreon.com/brosofdecay</a><br /><br />Mister Jean-Louise…<br /><br />A descendant from the Depont family that have been living in this picturesque French town since the beginning of the 16th century. The family Depont still resides in the town but Jean-Louis passed away around a decade ago, however, nobody seems to care about the belonging and memories that he left behind. Many people around town speculate that it is due to the chocking and dark display of taxidermy animals that can be seen throughout the house. Mister Jean-Louis started becoming obsessed with hunting after his wife passed away, and his children moved out, he was a very secluded person and could mostly be found inside his home or in the nearby Forrest. His house is a reflection of him and tells a much deeper story than we would have ever expected when we first walked inside. <br /><br />Let’s go through what remains and let’s put the pieces of the puzzle back together. <br /><br /><br />SOCIALS:<br />Instagram ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brosofdecay/">https://www.instagram.com/brosofdecay/</a><br />Facebook ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/Brothersofdecay/">https://www.facebook.com/Brothersofdecay/</a><br />Twitter ► <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/brosofdecay">https://twitter.com/brosofdecay</a><br /><br />Abandoned House Abandoned Mansion Urbex Exploring{% endraw %}
