{% raw %}We have successfully completed our new Kaeser shop air system in the new shop. I worked directly with Kaeser Compressors and Air Power Services to help me come up with the best system for my needs and wants. I wanted to go with one of their rotary screw compressors so they recommended the 5HP Air Tower plus the Kaeser Smart Pipe Plus compressed air piping with an additional 120 gallon auxiliary storage tank. The order of the equipment and installation was all handled by Air Power Services of Pensacola and they did a very professional job. Unfortunately my compressor is still being manufactured at the time of the install but Air Power Services offered to install one of their own units temporarily until my Air Tower is delivered. We'll follow up with another video once my unit is delivered. <br />Visit these links for more info on the Kaeser products we installed. <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://us.kaeser.com/products-and-solutions/rotary-screw-compressors/compressed-air-packages/airtowers/">https://us.kaeser.com/products-and-solutions/rotary-screw-compressors/compressed-air-packages/airtowers/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://us.kaeser.com/products-and-solutions/compressed-air-piping/?gclid=CjwKCAjwkYGVBhArEiwA4sZLuMexlBVIxIAIWvnX9a-KrD8mfkZa5U9lxcLVeni9JPmnuGZmcVRT5hoC7oEQAvD_BwE">https://us.kaeser.com/products-and-solutions/compressed-air-piping/?gclid=CjwKCAjwkYGVBhArEiwA4sZLuMexlBVIxIAIWvnX9a-KrD8mfkZa5U9lxcLVeni9JPmnuGZmcVRT5hoC7oEQAvD_BwE</a><br /><br />Air Power Services<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.airpowerservicesinc.com">https://www.airpowerservicesinc.com</a><br /><br /><br />Paypal Channel Donation: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=T325L5JZMY9LY&amp;source=url">https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;hosted_button_id=T325L5JZMY9LY&amp;source=url</a><br /><br />Support though Patreon: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.patreon.com/abom79">https://www.patreon.com/abom79</a><br /><br />My Amazon store where I'm adding many of the tools and products I use in my own shop.
