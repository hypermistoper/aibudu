{% raw %}Before and After Renovation (Time-Lapse) In this video, you'll see how we turned the top floor of an old Toronto home into an open concept master bedroom, with a zen-like, spa-style ensuite bathroom!<br /><br />Want to see what months of hard work looks like in a matter of seconds? We compiled all the time-lapse videos we took (from this angle) of this third-floor renovation.<br />...<br />If you look closely, youâ€™ll see we also added an open concept, spa style ensuite- wrapped in granite, and complete with a stand-alone tub and a unique rain head shower pole!<br /><br />#shorts{% endraw %}
