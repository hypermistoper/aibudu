{% raw %}40% ‚Äì that‚Äôs how much of the food you buy ends up getting tossed right in the garbage. 40%! Surprised? The culprit: improper storage. We are used to storing everything in our fridges: fruits, vegetables, sweets, breads. Some people also keep sauces, marinades, and cans in their fridges, just in case. But often, while storing foods like this might extend their shelf life, it can actually be harmful for the products.<br /><br />Did you know, for example, that tomatoes get even more flavorful and fragrant if you keep them at room temperature (about 70¬∞F) or above? Or that onion and garlic prefer warmer temperatures, too? They‚Äôre also afraid of light and won‚Äôt like being kept in a sunlit kitchen. And guys, never keep fries in the fridge! French fries, or any fried potatoes for that matter, contain a substance that can become toxic when kept in low temperatures. So, let‚Äôs see what conditions best protect some common products in the kitchen, and save you some money! <br /><br />Other videos you might like:<br />How Long Foods Stay In Your Stomach <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qhIT8sOymk">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qhIT8sOymk</a><br />10 Foods You Should and Shouldn't Wash Before Cooking <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvHMiduRS-g&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvHMiduRS-g&amp;</a><br />I Drank Only Water for 20 Days, See What Happened to My Body <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4DwmXK9gEY&amp;">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4DwmXK9gEY&amp;</a><br /><br />TIMESTAMPS:<br />Tomatoes 0:24 üçÖ<br />Onion and garlic 1:00<br />Potatoes 1:20<br />Mushrooms 1:44<br />Fresh greens and herbs 2:06 üåø<br />Chilled poultry and meat 2:29<br />Bananas and other tropical fruit 3:00 üçå<br />Honey 3:24 <br />Eggs 3:55 ü•ö<br />Milk, yogurt, and hard cheese 4:26<br />Grapes and berries 4:57<br />Apples 5:28 üçè<br />Vegetable oil 6:00<br />Carrots 6:12 ü•ï<br />Grains and flour 6:33<br />Watermelon 6:59 üçâ<br />Bread 7:21<br />Pet food 7:42<br />Coffee and tea 8:01 ‚òï<br />Sugar 8:22<br />Chocolate 8:41 üç´<br />Leftovers 9:01<br /><br />#foodstorage #healthydiet #brightside<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />- It‚Äôs much better to buy small portions of fresh tomatoes you can eat within a day. If you‚Äôve grown them yourself, keep them on the low shelf of the fridge.<br />- If you‚Äôre going to cook them later, just put mushrooms in a paper bag and keep them in the fridge. If you need to store them longer, first wash them, and then dry or freeze them. <br />- Don‚Äôt forget that meat is a possible source of different infectious bacteria. It can be stored in the fridge no longer than 2 days.<br />- Honey should be stored in a glass, ceramic, or metal container. The ideal place is dark and dry, so a shelf will do just fine as long as the cabinet has a door. <br />- Contrary to what refrigerator manufacturers seem to think, it‚Äôs not a good idea to store eggs in the fridge door. Each time you open it, the eggs get exposed to lower temperatures in the air.<br />- Milk and yogurt also shouldn‚Äôt be kept in the fridge door ‚Äì they spoil there faster than anywhere else. <br />- The best place for grapes is a ventilated plastic bag like the one they‚Äôre kept and sold in at the store. <br />- Apples shouldn‚Äôt be refrigerated. They‚Äôre also pretty finicky, so keep different kinds of apples separate from each other and put them in the pantry or cellar.<br />- Oils should be kept in a dark place at room temperature. If you can't find a dark place in your kitchen, wrap it in foil.<br />- Young carrots can be kept in a dark cool place where they‚Äôll stay fresh and crisp for a long time.<br />- Watermelon (and regular melon) will keep better if you store it at room temperature. <br />- Bread should be stored in a plastic ventilated bag, a cloth, or a paper bag, where it can stay soft for 5 days.<br />- Store tea and coffee in a dark dry place in a nontransparent container. Keep them away from food with a strong odor. <br />- Chocolate should be stored at room temperature in a dry place that‚Äôs exposed to sunlight.<br />- It‚Äôs a big mistake to make soup or hamburgers for a whole week unless you‚Äôre going to freeze them. The longest time leftovers can be stored in the fridge is 5 days.<br /><br />Music by Epidemic Sound  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.epidemicsound.com/">https://www.epidemicsound.com/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to Bright Side : <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://goo.gl/rQTJZz">https://goo.gl/rQTJZz</a><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />Our Social Media:<br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/brightside/">https://www.facebook.com/brightside/</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/">https://www.instagram.com/brightgram/</a><br />5-Minute Crafts Youtube: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC">https://www.goo.gl/8JVmuC</a><br /><br />Stock materials (photos, footages and other):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.depositphotos.com">https://www.depositphotos.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shutterstock.com">https://www.shutterstock.com</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.eastnews.ru">https://www.eastnews.ru</a><br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />For more videos and articles visit:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.brightside.me/">http://www.brightside.me/</a>{% endraw %}
