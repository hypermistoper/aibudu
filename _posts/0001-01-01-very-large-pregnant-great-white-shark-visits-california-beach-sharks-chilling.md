{% raw %}In a first for me, I found what appears to be a very large pregnant great white shark just off shore of a popular beach. This shark maybe the largest I've seen to date. Larger than the sharks I filmed last month near the whale carcass. The girth of this shark is noticeable. <br /><br />May sure to stick around for some of the most beautiful footage I've ever filmed of sharks going through kelp beds.<br /><br />CITATIONS:<br />Shark Study in 2014 regarding Sharks in Kelp Beds<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.livescience.com/65154-great-white-shark-cameras-seal-hunt.html">https://www.livescience.com/65154-great-white-shark-cameras-seal-hunt.html</a><br /><br />DISCLAIMER:<br />I'm NOT a marine biologist.
