{% raw %}World's Most Interesting Borders! Subscribe with notifications ðŸ”” and check out my other Youtube channels below! @JackSucksAtLife @JackSucksAtStuff @Jack Massey Welsh @JackSucksAtClips <br /><br />on JackSucksAtGeography we upload a range of easy to watch geography related games. We mainly play Sporcle games like &quot;naming all 197 countries&quot;. I successfully learned all 197 countries and plan to learn more Geography trivia. On this channel I also play Geoguessr. This is a game that uses Google Street View to drop you in a random location and you have to work out exactly where you are on the worldwide map. Geoguessr was created in 2013.
