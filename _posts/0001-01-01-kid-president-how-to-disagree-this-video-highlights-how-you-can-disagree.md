{% raw %}This video highlights how you can disagree with people respectfully. It recognises that we are not all going to agree with each other, because let's face it, &quot;people are different&quot;. However, we do have a choice as to how we treat people when we do disagree with them: respectfully or disrespectfully.{% endraw %}
