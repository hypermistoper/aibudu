Everyday we are being in a trouble with something... Problems can come from Marriage, School, Money, Work, Psychology and some other stuff. And, you see life is so short. Everyday more then 300.000 people are dying on world. Maybe we can be one of them in next hour... Everything could happen. Why I'm telling these? Because, these are so common things and reality of life and I know some solutions for these. The solution for all is improving your Iman. But, how?<br />There's a short way for this!
