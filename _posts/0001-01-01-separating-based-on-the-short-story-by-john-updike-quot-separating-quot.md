{% raw %}Based on the short story by John Updike, &quot;Separating&quot; tracks the dissolution of an American family, exploring themes of escapism and reflecting on modern manifestations of the American Dream.  The story is one of 18 in an anthology compiled and published as The Maple Stories (1979), tracing one family over several decades.<br /><br /><br /><br />excerpts from &quot;Separating&quot;, by John Updike (1974): <br /><br /><br /><br />The mountain before him moved closer, moved within him; he was huge, momentous.  The ache at the back of his throat felt stale.  His wife slept as if slain beside him.  When exasperated by his hot lids, his crowded heart, he rose from bed and dressed, she awoke enough to turn over.  He told her then, 'Joan, if I could undo it all, I would.' <br />'Where would you begin?' she asked. <br /><br /><br /><br />&quot;Dickie, I want to tell you something.  This last hour, waiting for your train to get in, has been about the worst of my life.  I hate this.  Hate it.  My father would have died before doing it to me.&quot;  He felt immensely lighter, saying this.  He had dumped the mountain on the boy.  They were home.  Moving swiftly as a shadow, Dickie was out of the car, through the bright kitchen.  Richard called after him, &quot;Want a glass of milk or anything?&quot;  <br />&quot;No thanks.&quot; <br />&quot;Want us to call the course tomorrow and say you're too sick to work?&quot; <br />&quot;No, that's all right.&quot;  The answer was faint, delivered at the door to his room; Richard listened for the slam that went with a tantrum.  The door closed normally, gently.  The sound was sickening. <br /><br /><br /><br />Why.  It was a whistle of wind in a crack, a knife thrust, a window thrown open on emptiness.  The waiting white face was gone, the darkness was featureless.  Richard had forgotten why.{% endraw %}
