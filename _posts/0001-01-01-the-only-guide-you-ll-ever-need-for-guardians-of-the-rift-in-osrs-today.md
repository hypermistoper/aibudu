{% raw %}Today Jagex finally fixed runecrafting for the casuals and non ticklords. They released Guardians of the Rift.<br /><br />This new Runecrafting mini-game completely changes the way you'll be runecrafting in the future. But it's a little complicated... but luckily for you; I spend all day finding the best method to get some pretty great XP.<br /><br />The rewards are dope and I can't wait to try out all the old runecrafting methods with 60% more runes.<br /><br />Hope you all enjoy my day of release guide<br /><br /><br />SOCIALS-<br /> TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/darniic">https://twitter.com/darniic</a><br /> TWITCH: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/darnic">https://www.twitch.tv/darnic</a><br /> DISCORD: discord.io/darnic{% endraw %}
