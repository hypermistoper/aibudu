{% raw %}#mostexpensivecard #top5cards #mostvaluablecard<br /><br />As if 2020 didn’t see enough of a spike in the most valuable sports cards in the world. 2021 is already starting off with another record breaking sale of a baseball card already featured on the top 5 list.  On January 14th, 2021, a BGS 9 1952 Mickey Mantle became the world’s most expensive card ever sold with the sale price of $5.2 million dollars. It almost doubled the price of the previous Mickey Mantle card sold with the same condition. Currently, all five of the most expensive cards of all time are baseball cards with the most recent Mantle purchase knocking Giannis Antetekoumpos card off the list. <br /><br />GEAR THAT I USE:<br />Camera: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3nbBI4F">https://amzn.to/3nbBI4F</a><br />Sound Card: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3b9Ah4C">https://amzn.to/3b9Ah4C</a><br />Microphone: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3hPx4II">https://amzn.to/3hPx4II</a><br />Mirabox Capture Card: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3pza5El">https://amzn.to/3pza5El</a><br />Lighting Kit: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3rAYdU1">https://amzn.to/3rAYdU1</a><br />Adjustable Microphone stand: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/37VdNSL">https://amzn.to/37VdNSL</a><br /><br />Link to my website for group breaks (NEW BREAKS ARE LIVE!): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://filthbombbreaks.com">https://filthbombbreaks.com</a> <br />Join our facebook group to be part of our community of collectors! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/TopTierCollectiblesBaseballBreaks/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/TopTierCollectiblesBaseballBreaks/</a> <br />Follow my Instagram for exclusive info &amp; early news: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/filthbombbreaks">https://www.instagram.com/filthbombbreaks</a>{% endraw %}
