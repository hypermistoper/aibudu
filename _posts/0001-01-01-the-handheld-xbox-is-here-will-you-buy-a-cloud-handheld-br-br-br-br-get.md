For a full list of this update‚Äôs bug fixes, see the Resolved Issues section below. New features and content included in this update are:<br /><br />NEW BATTLE PASS AND NARRATIVE SEQUENCE<br />Season 2 introduces a new 100-tier Battle Pass with up to 180 rewards. Purchasing the Premium Battle Pass is required to earn all rewards and 1,000 Halo Credits, but all players will be able to unlock free tiers that include rewards like Challenge Swaps, armor pieces, and the all new Lone Wolves armor core: RAKSHASA.<br /><br />In addition to this new Battle Pass, Season 2 introduces a new story experience for Halo Infinite. When first accessing the Season 2 menu, players will be able to watch an all new cinematic.<br /><br />This cinematic can be viewed again later by using the shortcut button listed in the helpbar near the bottom on the Season 2 menu.<br />Xbox Showcase:<br />If you're wondering why the run time for the Xbox showcase could be so much longer than PlayStation State of Play showcases, you need only look at their scarcity. Whereas PlayStation tends to hold shorter showcases every few months, Xbox typically holds out from regular announcements in favor of blockbuster showcases at major events like E3.<br /><br />Even though E3 has been cancelled this year, Xbox is still holding its traditional showcase at the same time. This is all against the backdrop of a changing summer games landscape, in which E3 has melted away in relevance over the last few years, only for other events like the Summer Games Fest and Gamescom Opening Night Live to take centre stage. <br /><br />As for what could be in the supposedly-90-minute showcase from Xbox and Bethesda, look no further than Starfield. It was last year at E3 2021 that we saw the first proper trailer for Bethesda's new RPG, and with the game slated to launch this year on November 11, it's high time we get to see actual gameplay footage at long last. <br /><br />Handheld Xbox:<br />Qualcomm is known for some of the world's most-used mobile chips, and recently the firm held a summit to reveal a slew of new gaming products. Firstly, we have the Qualcomm Snapdragon G3x Gen 1 gaming platform, and alongside it, the Snapdragon G3x Handheld Developer Kit.<br /><br />Qualcomm claims that there isn't yet a bespoke mobile gaming handheld device on the market (apparently they've never heard of the Nintendo Switch). With their new G3x platform, Qualcomm claims they're filling a niche that will allow Android games to enjoy similar experiences to that we have on console or PC. Interestingly, Qualcomm also specifically called out Xbox Cloud Gaming in their presentation, while showcasing a device from Razer, currently in the pipeline for the near future.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />By using our affiliate links we may receive compensation for purchases through those links.{% endraw %}
