{% raw %}Ben from Vtuned garage needed some help mounting the hood for his 65 mustang so we decided to help. The project is going along nicely and it was important that the hood opens. With the modifications done to the engine bay we had to make some adjustments to the hinges. If you want to see this thing completed stay tuned #23rd{% endraw %}
