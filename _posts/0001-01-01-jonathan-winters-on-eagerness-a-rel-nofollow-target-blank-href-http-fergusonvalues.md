{% raw %}<a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://FergusonValues.com">http://FergusonValues.com</a> - Welcome to Values Quotes. I'm Robert Ferguson.<br /><br />Today's quote is from Jonathan Winters, the famous American comedian, actor, and artist.<br /><br />One of the many great quotes from Winters is:<br />&quot;I couldn't wait for success... so I went ahead without it.&quot;<br /><br />That's great advice for anyone feeling impatient about achieving their goals. I believe Winters understood the value of eagerness.<br /><br />As a differentiating value, eagerness means excited by the desire of the pursuit; or prompt willingness.  <br /><br />By most standards, Winters is very successful, having appeared in nearly 50 movies and several TV shows during his lengthy career. But it wasn't just handed to him on a silver platter.<br /><br />While it appears he possessed certain natural talents, he worked hard at perfecting his craft.<br /><br />What Winters possessed was the eagerness to become a great comedian and actor. He was willing to move from one opportunity to the next, forcing him to keep his material fresh.<br /><br />So what about you?<br /><br />Do you have an important goal you are pursuing? How excited are you by the desire of the pursuit? <br /><br />If you're feeling impatient that things aren't happening fast enough, maybe the problem is the waiting. Maybe the problem is the expectation for something to happen -- that might not happen until YOU take action. <br /><br />I encourage you to embrace the value of eagerness, like Winters did, and be excited by the pursuit itself.{% endraw %}
