{% raw %}Textured floors in showers are a blessing and a curse.  First, they keep you from slipping which is great, but the texture also gets grimy, even when the shower is routinely cleaned.<br />As we are preparing our house for sale, I figured the filth would be an eyesore, so I set out to see if I could do something about it.  First I went to the store and bought some peroxide and baking soda.  It literally cost $1.50 total.  Then I grabbed my custom scrub brush adapter that I made for a previous video and a drill.<br />I mixed just enough peroxide into some baking powder to make a paste. I applied the paste to the shower floor and let is soak for a few minutes, then I put the scrub brush to work.  The results were amazing!  Only problem is that the floor is so clean, it makes the sides of the shower look horrible.  I guess I have some more work to do...<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thomaslightle">https://www.instagram.com/thomaslightle</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/redbarnwoodworking/">https://www.facebook.com/redbarnwoodworking/</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/tnlightle">https://twitter.com/tnlightle</a><br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.redbarnwoodworking.net">http://www.redbarnwoodworking.net</a>{% endraw %}
