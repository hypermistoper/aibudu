We discovered the world of “travel hacking” &amp; became obsessed. So after 2 years of obsessively saving $35k and over 2 million miles and points, we sold our cars and apartment and left home January 10, 2016 for a “one year” trip around the world. Our goal was to see as many places as possible before we ran out of money and went home to “normal life.” We started this travel vlog to share our experiences with friends and family, but quickly fell in love with this lifestyle and did everything we could to keep going. 4 years later, we achieved our new goal of visiting 100 countries and all 7 continents. We had no plans to slow down, until 2020 forced us to ;) Which is when we bought a converted van to start exploring our own country for the first time. Van life was a major adjustment and so different than flying every week like we were used to, but we are incredibly thankful to be able to continue doing something we love every day. 😊🎥🌎 <br /><br />#travel #travelvlog #vanlife<br /><br />0:00 prepping for our biggest adventure in the van!<br />1:34 Adding a roof rack to our van<br />6:07 Great deal on Athletic Greens!<br />7:15 Turning our shower into a Surf Locker<br />9:57 Dumping our poop…<br />11:55 De-winterizing the van<br />13:00 Do NOT make this mistake<br />15:25 Installing our new LADDER!<br />20:21 Why can’t we move our solar panels?<br />23:25 building our ROOF DECK!<br />25:47 FINALLY FINISHED<br />27:58 Celebratory happy hour on the roof{% endraw %}
