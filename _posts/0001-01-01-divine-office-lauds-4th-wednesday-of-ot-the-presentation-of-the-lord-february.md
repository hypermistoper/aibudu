It celebrates the holy convergence of Jesus the Messiah with His people who faithfully waited for His coming. Traditionally, the feast is celebrated with the greatest of joys and thanksgivings. Forty days after the solemnity of Christmas, Mary and Joseph consecrated Jesus in the Temple of Jerusalem, showing their obedience to God and fulfilling the Mosaic Law. Simeon, a just and devout man, utters a prophecy that Jesus will be the light of the Gentiles and the glory of Israel. Anna thanks God for the child and talks about him to all who looked to God for the deliverance of Jerusalem. Amid their joy looms the shadow of the cross, the opposition Jesus will face and the sword of suffering Mary, too, will experience. <br />+++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />Let us &quot;sanctify our day&quot; by praying the Liturgy of the Hours.<br /><br />The Liturgy of the Hours (Latin: Liturgia Horarum) or Divine Office (Latin: Officium Divinum) or Work of God (Latin: Opus Dei) or canonical hours,often referred to as the Breviary,is the official set of prayers &quot;marking the hours of each day and sanctifying the day with prayer&quot;.It consists primarily of psalms supplemented by hymns, readings and other prayers and antiphons. Together with the Mass, it constitutes the official public prayer life of the Church. The Liturgy of the Hours is the prayer of the whole People of God. In it, Christ himself “continues his priestly work through his Church.” His members participate according to their own place in the Church and the circumstances of their lives. The laity, too, is encouraged to recite the divine office either with the priests, among themselves or individually.<br /><br />Let us join the Universal Church in praying the Divine Office.<br />.<br />Amid coronavirus outbreak, with many people unable to attend Mass and isolated in their homes, Divine Office is inviting us to join in prayer. We hope more brothers and sisters will find spiritual nourishment, strength, and consolation in praying the Liturgy of the Hours as we all go through these difficult, uncertain times.<br /><br />We pray that this COVID19 come to end and for world peace.<br /><br />==================<br />CREDITS TO: <br /><br />Audio and text belongs to <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://divineoffice.org">https://divineoffice.org</a><br /><br />To offer support through the current pandemic crisis, the Divine Office Catholic Ministry made the website available to new members.
