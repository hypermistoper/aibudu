{% raw %}Perth USAsia Centre CEO Gordon Flake says to see former US President Donald Trump praise Vladimir Putin and label him a genius is just an “absolute shocker”. <br />  <br />Mr Trump said the Russian president made a “savvy” decision to recognise two territories in Ukraine as independent. <br />  <br />“The Republican Party in the United States went from 2012 with Mitt Romney on the debate stage calling Russia the United States’ greatest geopolitical foe,” Mr Flake told Sky News Australia. <br />  <br />“To today having the standard-bearer of the party, and potentially its next candidate coming out and continuing as he has for five years to fawn all over Vladimir Putin.”{% endraw %}
