{% raw %}As part of our breeding program, we regularly host male elephants. When we welcomed Khampten to the center, he had an abscess on his left front leg.<br />Before introducing him to the rest of the herd, our team first treated him at the hospital. <br /><br />Support us by donating on the link below!<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.elephantconservationcenter.com/donate-now/">https://www.elephantconservationcenter.com/donate-now/</a><br /><br />For more information about our work:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/elephantconservationcenter/">https://www.instagram.com/elephantconservationcenter/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/elephantconservationlaos/">https://www.facebook.com/elephantconservationlaos/</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.elephantconservationcenter.com/">https://www.elephantconservationcenter.com/</a>{% endraw %}
