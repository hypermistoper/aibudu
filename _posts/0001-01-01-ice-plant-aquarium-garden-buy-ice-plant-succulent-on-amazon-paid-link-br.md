{% raw %}Buy Ice Plant Succulent on Amazon (paid link):<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3JhniLH">https://amzn.to/3JhniLH</a><br /><br />September 4th, 2020 <br />I got a cutting of an Ice plant succulent, scientific name Delosperma. <br />Clean the plant and remove dry leaves. <br />The cutting has flower buds. <br />I want to check if this Ice plant succulent cutting would grow in water. <br />Trim the stem to a desirable length.<br /> Let's put this cutting in one of my 1 liter aquarium gardens with snails and scuds. <br />Time-lapse recording is the best way to watch blooming flowers. <br />Let's watch it together! <br />Two blooms open on the same day. <br />Each flower opens and closes on the same day. <br />The plant produces many more blooms in the following week. <br />Ice plant did not grow in water the way some other succulents grow all year around. <br />Nevertheless, I enjoyed the bloom and will try it again!<br /> Have fun and happy aquarium gardens :)<br /><br />Blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://rndmbits.blogspot.com/2022/03/ice-plant-aquarium-garden.html">https://rndmbits.blogspot.com/2022/03/ice-plant-aquarium-garden.html</a><br />Facebook group Best of: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/4162106783839748/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/4162106783839748/</a><br />More fun on my website www.fewdoit.com{% endraw %}
