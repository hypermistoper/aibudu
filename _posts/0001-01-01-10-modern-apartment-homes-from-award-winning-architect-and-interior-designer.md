{% raw %}Uniting the gestures of interior design, architecture and landscape, Fenwick embodies a coherent vision of modern apartment homes. Developed by ANGLE in collaboration with Edition Office and Flack Studio, the building uses an evolving connection to context to answer an open design brief.<br /><br />Situated on the banks of Yarra River in the Melbourne suburb of Kew, Fenwick straddles environments of dense forest and heritage buildings. As a unique by-product of its location – wherein nothing can be built in front of the home – the ten modern apartment homes have access to immersive, panoramic views that capture both the wilderness and city.<br /><br />The exterior of Fenwick purposefully interacts with the natural surrounds. Conceived as a broken mass, the modern apartment homes are divided amongst three distinct pavilions that allow for view corridors between parts, extending across the gardens to the landscaped scenes beyond.<br /><br />Presenting Fenwick as an extension of the environment, Eckersley Garden Architecture designs a landscape reminiscent of the neighbouring greenery. Lying beyond the modern apartment homes are layers of native shrubs, grasses and lower ground covers that change in accordance with the seasons, continuing to establish the development over time. <br /><br />With an interior design that draws the eye towards the outdoors, Fenwick thoroughly embraces its Kew context. By pursuing a connection to nature through interior design, architecture and landscaping, ANGLE ensures that the modern apartment homes effectively echo the language of the surrounds. <br /><br />00:00 - Introduction to the Modern Apartment Homes<br />00:42 - The Client Brief <br />01:29 - Finding Inspiration for the Apartment’s Design<br />02:18 - The Kitchen Island Bench<br />02:35 - Durable Material Selection<br />03:10 - Hero Spaces <br />03:30 - Landscape Architecture <br />04:42 - Connection to Country  <br /><br />For more from The Local Project: <br /><br />Instagram – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/">https://www.instagram.com/thelocalproject/</a> <br />Website – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/</a> <br />Print Publication – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/publication/</a> <br />The Local Marketplace – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/marketplace/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/marketplace/</a><br /><br />To subscribe to The Local Project's Tri-Annual Print Publication see here – <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/">https://thelocalproject.com.au/subscribe/</a> <br /><br />Photography by Ben Hosking.<br />Architecture by Edition Office.<br />Interior Design by Flack Studio.<br />Landscape Architecture by Eckersley Garden Architecture. <br />Development by ANGLE.<br />Filmed and Edited by Dan Preston. <br />Production by The Local Project.<br /><br />The Local Project Acknowledges the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples as the Traditional Owners of the land in Australia.
