{% raw %}5 DELICIOUS DINNER RECIPES to support your weight loss: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.chefaj.com/5-delicious-low-fat-dinner-recipes">https://www.chefaj.com/5-delicious-low-fat-dinner-recipes</a><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Peter Rogers M.D.<br /><br />Stanford university student athlete of the year, 1985. University of Illinois medical school award for best male medical student in class; best student in pathology; highest board scores in class of 333 students; biochemistry score 780/800, possibly the highest in the USA (biochem is the most difficult subject in medical school). Biochem is “considered” to include nutrition. Residency at Northwestern with 99% board scores. Fellowship in interventional radiology (imaging guided surgery) at Harvard. Fellowship in neuroradiology at Rush.<br /><br />Author of multiple books about nutrition, reducing risk of disease, and study skills. Discovered almost all the major medical textbooks are 50-100 years out of date, and often, completely wrong. Secret desire #1 = to become a nutrition doctor, but can’t, because there’s no money in it. Secret desire #2 = to rewrite the major medical textbooks, but can’t, because there’s no money in it. The shocking truth is that most medical textbooks are essentially worthless, because they do no include nutrition, and most disease is caused by poor nutrition.<br /><br />You tube &quot;Peter Rogers MD&quot; <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/PeterRogersMD/videos">https://www.youtube.com/c/PeterRogersMD/videos</a><br /><br />Amazon author page <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/entity/author/B00K5CY1XU?_encoding=UTF8&amp;node=2656022011&amp;offset=0&amp;pageSize=12&amp;searchAlias=stripbooks&amp;sort=author-sidecar-rank&amp;page=1&amp;langFilter=default#formatSelectorHeader">https://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/entity/author/B00K5CY1XU?_encoding=UTF8&amp;node=2656022011&amp;offset=0&amp;pageSize=12&amp;searchAlias=stripbooks&amp;sort=author-sidecar-rank&amp;page=1&amp;langFilter=default#formatSelectorHeader</a><br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />TIME CODE:<br />00:00 Guest introduction, bio and Dr. Rogers' plant-based journey <br />0:07:25 Chef AJ and viewer Q &amp; A<br />0:28:38 Slide show presentation <br />2:03:53 Final viewer Q &amp; A and show wrap{% endraw %}
