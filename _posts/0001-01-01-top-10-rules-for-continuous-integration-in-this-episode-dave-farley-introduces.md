{% raw %}In this episode Dave Farley introduces his &quot;10 Rules for Continuous Integration‚Äù - rules to organise a team to practise this vitally important aspect of modern software engineering. Dave was practising a version of CI in the early 1990s but refined his approach at ThoughtWorks in the early part of this century and is now seen as an expert in this field.<br /><br />Continuous Integration is more than just build automation. It also demands a change in the way that software development teams organise their work and, when practiced well, introduces a more disciplined approach to software development. <br /><br />This disciplined approach is even more important when practiced as a component of a Continuous Delivery Deployment Pipeline (CICD). Before Kent Beck introduced CI projects failed simply because teams couldn‚Äôt merge their work together. This is not a small change, and Continuous Integration is a cornerstone of any effective CD approach.<br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />If you want to learn Continuous Delivery and DevOps skills, check out Dave Farley's courses:<br /> ‚û°Ô∏è  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/DFTraining">https://bit.ly/DFTraining</a><br /> <br />üìö BOOKS:<br /><br />üìñ Dave‚Äôs NEW BOOK &quot;Modern Software Engineering&quot; is now available on <br />Kindle ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3DwdwT3">https://amzn.to/3DwdwT3</a><br />(Paperback version available soon)<br />In this book, Dave brings together his ideas and proven techniques to describe a durable, coherent and foundational approach to effective software development, for programmers, managers and technical leads, at all levels of experience.<br /><br />üìñ &quot;Continuous Delivery Pipelines&quot; by Dave Farley<br />paperback ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3gIULlA">https://amzn.to/3gIULlA</a><br />ebook version ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines">https://leanpub.com/cd-pipelines</a><br /><br />üìñ The original award-winning ‚ÄúContinuous Delivery&quot; book by Dave Farley and Jez Humble <br />‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2WxRYmx">https://amzn.to/2WxRYmx</a><br /><br />üìñ &quot;Accelerate, The science of Lean Software and DevOps&quot;, by Nicole Fosgren, Jez Humble &amp; Gene Kim ‚û°Ô∏è  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/2YYf5Z8">https://amzn.to/2YYf5Z8</a><br /><br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />You can get Dave‚Äôs FREE guide on ‚ÄúContinuous Integration Top Tips‚Äù when you join our CD Mail List here ‚û°Ô∏è <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.subscribepage.com/howto-ci-guide">https://www.subscribepage.com/howto-ci-guide</a><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />Dave Farley's Blog ‚û°Ô∏è  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/DaveFWebBlog">https://bit.ly/DaveFWebBlog</a><br /> <br />Dave Farley on Twitter ‚û°Ô∏è  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/DaveFTwitter">https://bit.ly/DaveFTwitter</a><br /><br />Dave Farley on LinkedIn ‚û°Ô∏è  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/DaveF-LI">https://bit.ly/DaveF-LI</a>{% endraw %}
