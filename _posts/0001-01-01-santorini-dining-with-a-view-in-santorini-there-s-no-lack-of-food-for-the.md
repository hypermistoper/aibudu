{% raw %}In Santorini there's no lack of food for the gourmet. In Fira, Imerovigli and Oia there are plenty of traditional taverns and a few famous chefs that serve refined versions of the healthy Mediterranean diet. There are plenty of places to serve a romantic dinner with a view of the caldera. It is worth while and definitely a unique thing to do while visiting. The view is a breathtaking one especially during sunset. Dining with a view to the volcano is a must experience !<br /><br />Official Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.mygreece.tv/destinations/santorini/">https://www.mygreece.tv/destinations/santorini/</a><br />Official Facebook Page: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/mysantorinitv">https://www.facebook.com/mysantorinitv</a>{% endraw %}
