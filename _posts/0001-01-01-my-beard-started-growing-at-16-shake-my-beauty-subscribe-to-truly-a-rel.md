Confused by what was happening, she was eventually diagnosed with PCOS - a condition that affects a woman’s hormone levels. One of the symptoms includes hirsutism, which creates excessive hair growth on the face, chest and back. She told Truly: “When it first started growing I felt confused and really embarrassed. I had really low confidence and self-esteem. I just wanted to hide.” Desperate to hide her facial hair, Gennevieve would constantly wax and shave. She said: “I avoided going out as much as humanly possible.” Eventually, she realised she didn’t want to hide anymore and started sharing photos of her beard on Instagram. “The reaction online was great. People were really supportive,” Gennevieve explained. Today, we see Gennevieve going to get her beard trimmed for the first time - something that five years ago, she never could have imagined doing. “I feel really proud of my beard. The advice that I want to give other women who have facial hair is that you are not alone. It is possible to learn to love it. I love my beard!”<br /><br />Follow Gennevieve here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beardedladyg/">https://www.instagram.com/beardedladyg/</a><br /><br />Videographer: Dennis Porter<br />Producers: Kathryn Lewsey, Natalia Giorgi<br />Editor: Josh Brown<br /><br />Truly is on TikTok! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show">https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show</a><br /><br />Now you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES">http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES</a><br /><br />Click here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! <br />Truly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow">https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow</a><br />Born Different - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/">https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/</a><br />Shake My Beauty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/">https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/</a><br />Hooked On The Look - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/">https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/</a><br />Love Don't Judge - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/">https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/</a><br />Beastly - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/</a><br />Ridiculous Rides - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/">https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/</a><br />Dog Dynasty - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/">https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/</a><br /><br />For more amazing content, click here!<br />Beastly: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA</a><br />Barcroft Cars: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured">https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured</a>{% endraw %}
