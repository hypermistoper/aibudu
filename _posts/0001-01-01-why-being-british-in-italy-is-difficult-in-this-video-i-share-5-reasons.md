I didn't know anyone there, I didn't speak the language and I had only visited the country twice before. Just eight months after I had made this decision, I packed up my suitcases and moved solo from London to Italy, embarking on my very first Expat experience. On paper it sounds completely bonkers but in reality it was the making of me. <br /><br />On this channel I serve up a slice of real Italian life through weekly vlogs and videos. I also share tips on how to navigate life as an Expat in Italy, coping strategies, lessons learnt and my unique insight into life as a Brit in Italy.<br />#movingtoitaly #livinginitaly #britinitaly{% endraw %}
