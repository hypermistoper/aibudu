{% raw %}Shenzhen TV: It is reported that an unnamed US official said that since December 2021, the US talked with China at the foreign ministers’ level and other senior-official level a half dozen times to tell China that Russia was preparing to attack Ukraine and beseech China to persuade Russia not to do so. The Chinese side shrugged it off and even shared the information with Moscow, saying that China would not try to impede Russian actions. Do you have any comment?<br /><br />Wang Wenbin: We firmly reject the disinformation fabricated by the US to smear China. I noted that Thomas L. Friedman, an American expert in international affairs, and Tulsi Gabbard, a former member of the US House of Representatives have criticized the US for the role it plays in the Ukraine crisis. The US should do some soul-searching.<br /><br />As I just stressed, China always decides its position and policies based on the merits of the matter itself and stands on the side of peace, cooperation, fairness and justice. In recent days, President Xi Jinping had telephone conversations with leaders including Russian President Putin and French President Macron, pointing out that China supports Russia and Ukraine in resolving the issue through negotiation, calls on relevant parties to stick to the general direction of political settlement and seek a comprehensive settlement of the Ukraine issue through dialogue and consultation.<br /><br />State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke over the phone with foreign ministers and dignitaries of several countries to state China’s five-point position on the Ukraine issue, stressing that the Cold War mentality should be completely abandoned and the legitimate security concerns of all countries should be respected. The top priority now is for all parties to exercise necessary restraint to prevent the situation on the ground in Ukraine from deteriorating or even spiraling out of control. The life and property safety of civilians should be effectively guaranteed, and in particular, large-scale humanitarian crises should be prevented. China supports and encourages all diplomatic efforts conducive to the peaceful settlement of the Ukraine crisis. Ukraine should function as a bridge between the East and the West, not a frontier in big power confrontation. China also supports Europe and Russia in their efforts to hold dialogue on an equal footing over the European security issue, uphold the notion of indivisible security, and eventually form a balanced, effective and sustainable European security mechanism.<br /><br />China’s practice stands in stark contrast to that of a certain country, who has created and shifted crisis to others, and reaped gains from it. I believe people will make a fair judgment as to which approach is more conducive to the security, stability and lasting peace in Europe.<br /><br />We hope all parties will work with China to deescalate instead of fueling the tensions and promote diplomatic settlement rather than further escalation. China will continue to play a constructive role in seeking and realizing peace. <br /><br />__________________<br />Powered by Shanghai Media Group, ShanghaiEye focuses on producing top-quality content for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Youtube.<br />Nobody knows Shanghai better than us.<br />Please subscribe to us  ☻☻☻<br />__________________<br />For more stories, please click <br />■ What's up today in Shanghai, the most updated news of the city<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MNjpE4hspSVry8dR555getN">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MNjpE4hspSVry8dR555getN</a><br />■ Amazing Shanghai, exploring the unknown corners of the city,  learning the people, food and stories behind them<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MMVTWr-zIXjsS4hhSQPmyes">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MMVTWr-zIXjsS4hhSQPmyes</a><br />■ What Chinese people's lives are like during the post COVID-19 period<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MPrPTmIirpfgETu6VKVESXe">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MPrPTmIirpfgETu6VKVESXe</a><br />■ Views of foreign scholars on China and its affairs<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MO9ua_nSK6slRPdUl-ovjRe">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MO9ua_nSK6slRPdUl-ovjRe</a><br />■ Foreign faces in Shanghai, people living in this city sharing their true feelings<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MP0vJDSw23_1MCPJhAfGbiG">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MP0vJDSw23_1MCPJhAfGbiG</a><br />■ Mini-docs showing why China is the country it is today <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MOreRu2AbZ3ziIUyCcdBLwX">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeyl7CQ2A5MOreRu2AbZ3ziIUyCcdBLwX</a><br />__________________<br />☎Leave us messages if you have any suggestions or questions!<br />Thank you!{% endraw %}
