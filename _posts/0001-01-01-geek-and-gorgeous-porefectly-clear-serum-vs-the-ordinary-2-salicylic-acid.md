There are many great affordable brands out there: The Inkey List, Good Molecules, Geek and Gorgeous or pixi skincare to name a few of my favorites, and if you know how to combine them, you are well on your way to healthy and happy skin.<br />Healthy and happy skin does not mean &quot;flawless&quot; - whatever that might be. I have been struggling with acne, hyperpigmentation and postinflammatory erythema (PIH and PIE) for most of my adult life, and it took me a while to figure out that gentle is key. I went through a retinol damaged skin barrier, acne flare ups and sun damage until I finally reached my happy place: With Tretinoin, sunscreen and of course a red lipstick!<br /><br />Disclaimer: <br />I am a doctor, so I do have a good understanding of scientific studies, skin and ingredients.This video is not intended to provide diagnosis, treatment or medical advice.
