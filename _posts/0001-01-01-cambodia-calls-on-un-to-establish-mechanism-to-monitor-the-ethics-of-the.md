This includes a call for the establishment of an oversight mechanism to ensure the effective implementation of the Special Rapporteur's code of conduct.<br /><br />Recently, there has been an increased exchange between the UN Special Rapporteur and the Cambodian representative to the UN at the UN Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva, Switzerland. The 49th session of the UN Human Rights Council was held from 28 February to 1 April 2022.<br /><br />On 30 March, Ambassador Sokkhoeurn An responded to a statement made by the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights in Cambodia, Vitit Muntarbhorn, asking for proof of his report that human rights and democracy in Cambodia are in a worrying state of regression. He also reminded the Special Rapporteur that the human rights agenda is not a “sprint”, but rather “a marathon run with commitment, effort and progress.” He emphasized that such discussions on the topic should be conducted “on the basis of statistics and efforts, and not perception.”<br />................................................................................................................<br />The official EAC YouTube Channel.
