{% raw %}You do not need to hit to hurt. Stop verbal abuse.<br /><br /><br /><br />Firdaus Kharas, Chairman of Chocolate Moose Media and Culture Shift, launched a new animated campaign to prevent domestic violence and abuse. He said of the &quot;No Excuses&quot; Campaign: &quot;I am very pleased to be able to launch the 'No Excuses' Campaign after 2.5 years of work by a group of dedicated volunteers in Canada, Holland, South Africa and Switzerland. Domestic violence and abuse are insidious problems that reach into every corner of every country. These animated spots are not threatening or authoritarian. They do not further stigmatize the victims. Instead, the campaign uses humour and animation to create a range of messages that will cause behaviour change by speaking directly to the abuser and by being a catalyst to stimulate discussions in millions of households.&quot;<br /><br /><br /><br />View the entire press conference: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.unmultimedia.org/tv/webcast/2011/04/press-conference-firdaus-khara...">http://www.unmultimedia.org/tv/webcast/2011/04/press-conference-firdaus-khara...</a><br /><br /><br /><br />No Excuses campaign: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.noexcusescampaign.org/">http://www.noexcusescampaign.org/</a>{% endraw %}
