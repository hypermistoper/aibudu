{% raw %}While being escorted to a mysteriously irradiated site, a scientist experiences strange visions. <br /><br />Using a realtime game engine, a motion-capture facility, and off-the-shelf visual assets, acclaimed VFX artist Sava Zivkovic showcases the immense potential of Virtual Production to filter down to indie filmmakers everywhere. <br /><br />A selection of Short of the Week, the web's leading curators of quality short films.<br /><br />SUBMIT A FILM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shortoftheweek.com/submit/">https://www.shortoftheweek.com/submit/</a><br />FULL REVIEW:  <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shortoftheweek.com/2021/08/19/irradiation/">https://www.shortoftheweek.com/2021/08/19/irradiation/</a><br /><br />Subscribe to S/W on YouTube!<br />Website: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.shortoftheweek.com">http://www.shortoftheweek.com</a><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ShortoftheWeek">https://www.instagram.com/ShortoftheWeek</a><br />Facebook: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/shortoftheweek">https://www.facebook.com/shortoftheweek</a><br />Twitter: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/shortoftheweek">https://twitter.com/shortoftheweek</a><br /><br />IRRADIATION<br />Directed by Sava Zivkovic<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://vimeo.com/savazivkovic">https://vimeo.com/savazivkovic</a><br /><br />&quot;Did you know that Jon Favreau &quot;shot&quot; the latest Lion King in VR? That the reason The Mandalorian is able to produce such epic landscapes on a TV production timetable is that it is filmed in front of a giant LED screen which adapts to the camera in realtime? Oh, you did. Disney is the biggest name in entertainment and never suffers from a lack of publicity, so it makes sense that you've encountered one of the many trend pieces that describe the emerging field of &quot;Virtual Production&quot; and how it is a &quot;gamechanger&quot; and &quot;the future of filmmaking&quot;. <br /><br />You may know this, but it is one thing for these bleeding-edge tools to be in the hands of creators at multi-billion dollar studios, what you might not know is how close we are to their adoption by the rest of us.<br /><br />Today's short is truly a fascinating glimpse at the current state of play. From acclaimed VFX artist Sava Zivkovic, Irradiation is a 9min mood piece that crosses sci-fi horror with &quot;Chernobyl&quot;-inspired imagery, creating a heady CG animated short long on atmosphere and menace. Many of the usual hallmarks of a sci-fi proof-of-concept apply here: detailed, photo-realistic characters that might trick more than a few of you, terrific motion, cinematic direction, and detailed environmental worldbuilding are all featured. What is even more notable than the end product though is how it came together; both its workflow and the film's status as a personal passion project.<br /><br />Using a realtime game engine, a motion-capture facility, and off-the-shelf visual assets, Zivkovic creates a million-dollar-looking animation largely by himself. Irradiation is great, but it's not terribly dissimilar from work we see all around us—in movies and TV, or advertising and gaming. However, as recently as a couple of years ago, you'd expect work of this quality to require at least a small studio and/or for it to take months of labor. Instead, Zikovic produced Irradiation in 4 weeks in a manner more akin to an indie guerrilla shoot... <br /><br />READ THE FULL REVIEW at — <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.shortoftheweek.com/2021/08/19/irradiation/">https://www.shortoftheweek.com/2021/08/19/irradiation/</a><br /><br />CREDITS<br />Written and Directed by - Sava Zivkovic<br />Assets provided by – Big Medium Small<br />Motion Capture and Animation – Take One<br /><br />Motion capture performance:<br />Evgeniy – Nebojsa Jez<br />Mirbek – Dejan Jovanovic<br />Usmon – Lazar Djukic<br /><br />Voice Acting:<br />Evgeniy – Oleg Fedorov<br />Mirbek – Andrey Matveev<br />Usmon – Andrey Matveev<br /><br />Translation – Marnia Vasilkina and Polina Zabrodskaya<br />Dialogue Recording Coordinator – Eugene Krasnoded<br />Dialogue Recording – NevaFIlm<br />Dialogue Processing and Final Mix – Bogdan Brakovic<br />Sound Design, Foley Artist, Foley Engineer, Sound Editing and Mixing - Marko Zivanovic / Devotion Studios<br />Music by - Iz Svemira<br />Realtime TD – Michael Zaman<br />Rigging Support – Lucas Salamon<br /><br />Special thanks – Jama Jurabaev<br /><br />Tools: Unreal Engine, Blender, Zbrush, Substance Painter, Adobe Suite.<br /><br />Reproduced on this channel with the permission of the filmmakers.{% endraw %}
