{% raw %}This Thursday, January 27, is International Holocaust Remembrance Day. We call to mind the human tragedy of the Shoah, the memories of all the victims, and the survivors’ struggles. We have a responsibility to remember, no less now than in 1945, the horrendous places to which antisemitism and hatred can lead. As the last generation of survivors leaves us, including my grandmother who passed away last year, what names will you remember?<br /><br />Credits: <br />Lyrics: Zelda Schneurson Mishkovsky (1914-1984)<br />Music: Hanan Yovel (1946), arr. Oran Eldor <br />Recorded live at Park Avenue Synagogue, Yom Kippur 2021{% endraw %}
