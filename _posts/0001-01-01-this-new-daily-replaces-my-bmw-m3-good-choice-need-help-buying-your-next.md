{% raw %}Need help buying your next car? Click the following link and my team and I will help you choose your ideal car at a fair price - from Mat Watson! <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://bit.ly/Wow-Me-carwow">https://bit.ly/Wow-Me-carwow</a><br />.............................................................<br /><br />Itâ€™s a sad day at carwow HQ, as Mat has to say goodbye to his long-term BMW M3 Competition ðŸ˜ž However, we wonâ€™t be upset for too long, as heâ€™s set to replace it with the all-new BMW M5 CS!! <br /><br />The question is, when comparing it to the BMW M3, will it live up to the eye-watering Â£140,000+ price tag - Â£50k MORE than his M3! <br /><br />Well for starters, letâ€™s check out whatâ€™s under the bonnet! Just like in the regular M5, youâ€™ll find a 4.4-litre twin-turbo V8, but this has been tuned to deliver 635hp &amp; 750Nm of torque! Thatâ€™s pretty impressive, but then again the M3 wasnâ€™t exactly low on power, with its 3-litre twin-turbo straight-six able to put down 510hp &amp; 650Nm! <br /><br />So how does the rest of the car compare? Well, youâ€™ll find a number of changes throughout the car, from the polarising grille design of the M3 through to the sports seats in the BACK of the M5 CS! <br /><br />So what do you think, is this a good swap for Mat? And more importantly, is it worth that HUGE price tag? Youâ€™ll have to keep watching to find out!<br /><br />Chapters<br />00:00 Intro<br />00:44 Engine<br />01:54 Drifting<br />03:23 Exterior Design<br />04:06 Twisty Road Driving<br />07:20 Interior &amp; Back Seats<br />09:04 Boot<br />09:34 Launch &amp; Brake Tests<br />11:42 Verdict<br /><br /><br />.............................................................<br />Instagram â€“Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.instagram.com/carwow">http://www.instagram.com/carwow</a><br /><br />Tiktok -Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow">https://www.tiktok.com/@carwow</a><br /><br />Facebook â€“Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk">http://www.facebook.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Twitter â€“Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk">http://www.twitter.com/carwowuk</a><br /><br />Sign Up to our Newsletter â€“Â <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter">http://bit.ly/carwow-Newsletter</a><br /><br />Awkward haggling is a thing of the past with carwow.
