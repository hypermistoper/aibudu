{% raw %}Fun wall decorations anyone can try to make their home sparkle<br /><br /><br /><br />To give some color to your walls, I show you some beautiful DIY ideas and hacks that will make your home shiny. <br /><br />If you want a brick-like decoration, you place the tape in little rectangle shapes around your wall and then paint your walls a reddish color. Then, remove the tape and it’ll look like a brick wall. <br /><br />For a more refreshing wall look in your kitchen, you can dip some lemon halves in red paint and then use them as stamps on your walls. <br /><br />You can do something similar in your living room to give it a very tropical look, but instead of lemons, use tropical leaves instead. <br /><br />If you want to create something big to decorate your home, cut some stencils in large triangles and then using emulsion to create a gradient scenery. <br /><br />For a more squared and minimal look in your kitchen, take an ice-cube tray and dip it in black paint, then use it as a stamp on your wall. <br /><br /><br /><br />Timestamps: <br /><br />0:52 – Wall décor ideas<br /><br />1:55 – Coffee stains wall décor<br /><br />4:39 – Paint roller décor<br /><br />6:34 – Gradient wall effect<br /><br />7:34 – Newspaper art<br /><br />10:53 – Tropical wall pattern  <br /><br /><br />This video is made for entertainment purposes.
