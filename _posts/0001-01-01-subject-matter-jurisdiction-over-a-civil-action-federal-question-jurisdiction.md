This means that federal judicial power extends only to specific and limited types of cases. This presentation will discuss federal courts’ subject matter jurisdiction. Before a court can get to the merits of a case, it must have authority to decide the issue at hand. The authority of the court to render a decision on a type of case is called jurisdiction over the “subject matter.” While courts also require authority to determine the rights and liabilities of the parties before it, a concept known as “personal” jurisdiction, this discussion is limited to the types of cases federal courts may hear.<br /><br />National Paralegal College offers undergraduate programs leading to a paralegal certificate, paralegal associate’s degree, bachelor’s degree in legal studies, bachelor’s degree in business administration, or joint program in legal and business studies.
