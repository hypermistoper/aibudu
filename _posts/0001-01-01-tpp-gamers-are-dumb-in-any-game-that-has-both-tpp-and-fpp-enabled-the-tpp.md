{% raw %}In any game that has both TPP and FPP enabled, the TPP players are generally always made fun of, but should they? I tried to test this statement and see if FPP players were any smarter. Turns out they really weren't. Most players are generally unaware of their surroundings. If anything, the FPP players were actually more experienced and had a higher average level, but still falling for an obvious bait.<br /><br />╔═╦╗╔╦╗╔═╦═╦╦╦╦╗╔═╗<br />║╚╣║║║╚╣╚╣╔╣╔╣║╚╣═╣<br />╠╗║╚╝║║╠╗║╚╣║║║║║═╣<br />╚═╩══╩═╩═╩═╩╝╚╩═╩═╝<br />----------------------------------------------------------------<br />• Twitch - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.twitch.tv/iambenjoi">https://www.twitch.tv/iambenjoi</a><br />• Discord - <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://discord.gg/xtwTApC">https://discord.gg/xtwTApC</a><br />• Creator Code Benjoi: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://accounts.krafton.com/login">https://accounts.krafton.com/login</a>{% endraw %}
