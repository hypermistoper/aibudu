Wrong! Digital is much more complex and several filters and corrections are at work and may degrade strongly the signal. Here is some info on this topic:<br />1 - Vibration control helps any type of gear. All producers all over the world in decent CD players have introduced vibration control solutions inside them and for the chassis due to acoustic and mechanical resonance issues (which create vibrations) and issues in the rotation and also the electronic components that are present in all standard players (for example capacitors). Errors may occur and the wrong correction of these can bring to sonic degradation (see point 2), and the reduction of these errors can occur also by reducing vibrations. In any case I am not focusing exclusively on the laser beam. Adding more control will help the existing vibration control solutions integrated in the player and also the other processes that take place inside the player. Vibrations can introduce noise and distortion. Check this chapter of this world famous engineer, Ken Pohlmann and what he says about vibrations with CD players: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://books.google.it/books?id=Ed38...">https://books.google.it/books?id=Ed38...</a><br /><br />2 - OK, its pits and lands, but let’s not forget that the laser in a CD player is not truly reading data, it is scanning the surface to search for a pit or a land and based on what the laser finds it is reflects back (land=1) or not (pit=0), which then is transformed by the photoelectric cell in electric current according to the received signal (1s or 0s). The electronic circuit recreates the pattern that was scanned etc. As you can imagine things can go wrong here, striating from the lens. People always focus on the pick up but never think of the handling of the signal in its digital form and then analog form in a CD player. Here vibrations already can create issues and the Auric helps in the reading of this scanning and the rotation of the disc, which is never perfect.<br /><br />Going back to the lens cleaner the laser and the reflection may be obstructed by dirt. Yes, the disk can skip in the worse scenario, but it can also introduce sonic degradation do to the INTERPOLATION (concealment) of the error correction codec. That is the software that is guessing how the sound could be, producing a faulty recreation of the signal with a bandwidth lowering and overall quality. Most importantly, in this page of the book by engineers Rumsey and Mccormick you can read about the effects of interpolation during error correction: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://books.google.it/books?id=Y477AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA263&amp;lpg=PA263&amp;dq=error+correction+interpolation+sound&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uOwC25bkpa&amp;sig=ACfU3U3P0jdRXZ_YJW4w4SRJF2kha2ysyQ&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiyg76_-ajmAhUhIMUKHZyMDksQ6AEwBXoECAkQBA#v=onepage&amp;q=error%20correction%20interpolation%20sound&amp;f=false">https://books.google.it/books?id=Y477AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA263&amp;lpg=PA263&amp;dq=error+correction+interpolation+sound&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=uOwC25bkpa&amp;sig=ACfU3U3P0jdRXZ_YJW4w4SRJF2kha2ysyQ&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiyg76_-ajmAhUhIMUKHZyMDksQ6AEwBXoECAkQBA#v=onepage&amp;q=error%20correction%20interpolation%20sound&amp;f=false</a><br /><br />More Ana[dia]log groove here:<br />INSTAGRAM: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/ana.dia.log">https://www.instagram.com/ana.dia.log</a><br />FACEBOOK: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/anadialog1">https://www.facebook.com/anadialog1</a><br />TWITTER: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/anadialog">https://twitter.com/anadialog</a><br /><br />#compactdisc #cdtransport #cd{% endraw %}
