{% raw %}Here is a sincere effort to bring brevity to Samskrta numbers. I have seen that sometimes there is no set way of saying a given number n in samskrtam . Hence i have used the technique , inspired by the Katapayaadi system  to 'algebrise' the numerals . Also , as a bonus , we have a few symbols and acronyms to denote other mathematical operators . <br />Hope you take all this with a pinch of salt since  none of this is &quot;paninian grammar&quot; , Hence it will only fetch few marks if used formally. The main purpose is to bring the idea of brevity in people and make them think and come up with many more novel ideas. <br /><br />Also visit our playlist to have some more fun with the other lessons <br /><br />Drop your comments and suggestion below <br />Help us  by subscribing to our channel.
