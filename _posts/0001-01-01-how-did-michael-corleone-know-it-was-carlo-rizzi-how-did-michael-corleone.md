{% raw %}How did Michael Corleone know that Carlo Rizzi was the traitor who had set up Sonny Corleone?<br /><br />In the Godfather, the one event that completely changed the paradigm of the Corleone family’s fight for supremacy, was the trap placed for the acting don, Sonny Corleone. There was someone within the family that had conspired to have him taken out, a traitor. However after years of rebuilding, Michael finally confronts this traitor after years of putting them at ease, giving them a false sense of security. As we all know, this traitor was Carlo Rizzi. So the question that we all have been wondering, is how did Michael know, Although we can assume that he concluded that he saw through that.<br />However, upon looking into this further, it's actually not as simple or clear as we all thought, rather was actually quite shocking….<br /><br />At the height of the 5 families war, Carlo betrayed the Corleone family and played a crucial role in taking out the acting boss, Santino Corleone, Shifting the balance of power in the war. After sonny was taken out, the don gathers what strength he had left, and goes to negotiate a peace deal with the other families. Which put them in a bad position, however he knew that if the family was to survive, he would need some time, and make sure his son Michael is back to takeover and regain their position on top. And so, after Micheals return, a couple years go by and he is now the new don, and the time had come to settle all the families unfinished business. One of them was avenging his older brothers murder. But after seemingly giving Carlo more responsibility and having him enter the closely knit inner circle, even becoming godfather to his son, Michael confronts Carlo on his betrayal, which completely shocks him. But the question we all have, is how, how did Michael uncover that it was Carlo who had betrayed the family and had pulled that little stunt courtesy of don Barzini.  How was Michael able to even get a confession from Carlo, revealing the final thread of this scheme.<br /><br />So who is Carlo? <br />Carlo was of half northern Italian and half Sicilian descent, he grew up in  native of Nevada and former labourer, <br />Carlo migrated to New York City following trouble with the law and later became a friend of Sonny Corleone, through whom he met Sonny's sister Connie in 1941 at a surprise birthday party for Sonny's father Vito.<br />They were married on the last Saturday of August 1945 in a traditional Sicilian wedding at the Corleone compound, a compromise made in order to appease Vito, who was disappointed with his daughter's choice in a husband. <br /><br />To put things into perspective, here is a timeline of the events, to give us an overall view of the backstory as well as what led to all this.. and also summarise what had happened so that we can go into the important details.<br /><br />📸 𝐉𝐨𝐢𝐧 𝐔𝐬 𝐎𝐧 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚 @𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐂𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐮𝐫𝐞𝐌𝐚𝐟𝐢𝐚<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/theculturemafia/">https://www.instagram.com/theculturemafia/</a><br /><br />𝐓𝐡𝐚𝐧𝐤 𝐘𝐨𝐮 𝐅𝐨𝐫 𝐖𝐚𝐭𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐧𝐠<br /><br />_________________________________________________________________<br /><br />All materials in these videos are used for educational purposes and fall within the guidelines of fair use.
