This giveaway is sponsored by Amok.<br />2. Amok can only ship the prize to certain countries (link below).<br />3. The winner will receive 1 Draumr 5.0 hammock, 1 Fj√∏l pad, 1 Skjold 10 tarp, and 1 pole set.  There will be one winner and they will receive all of these items.  These are the regular models and the contest does not include ultralight models.<br />4. To enter, simply comment on this video.  (For example, tell us what colour Draumr you would pick, a question you have about Amok, etc.  You do not have to write an essay; any comment will be considered.)<br />5. A randomized comment picker (such as <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://commentpicker.com/youtube.php)">https://commentpicker.com/youtube.php)</a> will be used to select a winner from comments on this video.  Comments on other videos will NOT be eligible.<br />6. You must write your own comment to enter.  Replies to comments will be filtered out by the randomized comment picker and will NOT be eligible.<br />7. One entry per person.  Duplicate comments will be filtered out by the randomized comment picker and will NOT be eligible.<br />8. Profane, vulgar, political, or inappropriate comments may be deleted at my sole discretion and you will not be eligible if your comment is deleted (I don't want to delete anyone's comments so don't write anything offensive or extreme and you'll have nothing to worry about).<br />9. The draw will be held as close as possible to June 16th, 2022, so you must comment before the draw on that date to be eligible.  If for any reason I cannot do the draw on that date (e.g. if I'm away on a trip), it will be rescheduled as soon as possible and the entry period will remain open until the draw is done.<br />10. The winner can choose any colour Draumr 5.0 that is in stock when they claim their prize.<br />11. The winner is responsible for looking for the subsequent giveaway draw video, as this is how they will be notified.  No personal information is collected, so this is the only way the winner will know that they have won.<br />12. The prize must be claimed within 3 weeks and a valid shipping address must also be provided by the winner within this timeframe (see countries that Amok can ship to here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amok-equipment.com/pages/shopping-and-shipping).">https://amok-equipment.com/pages/shopping-and-shipping).</a>  If the winner cannot provide a shipping address in one of these countries by then or if this date is missed for any reason, the prize will be forfeited and the giveaway will be re-drawn to select a new winner.  <br />13.
