{% raw %}Glenn begins by giving a detailed update on the current struggle between Russia &amp; Ukraine: which countries have backed Putin, new ways the world is standing against Russia, and what Ukrainian politicians predict may be coming next. But then, Glenn details 5 facts about the invasion that just don’t ‘make sense.’ For example, why didn’t Putin immediately destroy internet access in Ukraine to confuse both citizens and their military?
