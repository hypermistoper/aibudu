{% raw %}A few months ago, I decided to purchase a folding bike to more easily take with me in the car on short trips. I found out about the existence of the Sinclair A-Bike, and it was such a weird product that I knew I just had to try it. I ordered a Chinese clone of the bike from AliExpress, which turned out to be a big mistake, as it appeared to be lost in shipping for almost 4 months. After giving up hope and purchasing a different bike, the knock-off A-Bike arrived a few days later, so I figured I’d at least give it a try.<br /><br /><br />Spoilers: I would not recommend the A-Bike, instead recommending a kick scooter to those who want a small folding mode of transport they can take with them in a bus or train. It’s definitely an interesting experience to ride, but I would not consider it to be practical or reliable in any way above other alternatives. <br /><br /><br /><br />Product Links (Amazon Paid / Sponsored Links)<br /><br />Sailnovo Electric Bike (better bike alternative): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3z4rwBf">https://amzn.to/3z4rwBf</a><br /><br />Razor A5 Lux or DLX (Better light scooter): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3iyijKY">https://amzn.to/3iyijKY</a><br /><br />Razor A5 Air (More versatile, better on rough roads): <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://amzn.to/3hTTqu4">https://amzn.to/3hTTqu4</a>{% endraw %}
