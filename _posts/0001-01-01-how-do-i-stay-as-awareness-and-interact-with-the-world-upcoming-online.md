{% raw %}Upcoming Online Retreat with Mooji — A Call to Awakening — 25-29 May, 2022<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.org/events/a-call-to-awakening-retreat-may-2022">https://mooji.org/events/a-call-to-awakening-retreat-may-2022</a><br />Registration closes Monday, 23 May at 8:00am Lisbon time<br /><br />In this insightful exchange, a student shares that he finds himself getting personally identified when interacting and speaking with others. He asks for Moojibaba’s guidance on how to remain as awareness in these moments.<br /><br />“You must recognise that the one speaking is itself a movement inside the unchaining awareness. Awareness did not leave itself.<br /><br />See that this is just a call to clarify your seeing: ‘Am I really what I am seeing?’ <br />Whatever the scenario is, ask: ’Is this actually an authentic reading of my being?’”<br /><br />27 March 2022<br /><br />~<br /><br />If you would like to support the sharing of Satsang, you can donate here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://mooji.org/donate?tcode=mtv7">https://mooji.org/donate?tcode=mtv7</a><br /><br />#Mooji #satsang #spirituality #advaita #nonduality #awakening{% endraw %}
