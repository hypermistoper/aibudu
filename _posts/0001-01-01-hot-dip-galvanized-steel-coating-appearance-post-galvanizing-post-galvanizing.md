{% raw %}Post-galvanizing there are a few factors that can impact the appearance of the zinc coating. After hot-dip galvanizing, steel parts are inspected for conformance to the specifications and at times there is a need for small areas requiring touch-up or repair. Some touch-up and repair practices can lead to differences in appearance. Other coating appearance changes can be discovered after exposure to the environment.<br /><br />0:38 Post Galvanizing Inspection<br />0:50 Grinder and File Marks<br />1:16 Touch Up Materials and Methods<br />2:38 Vent Hole Plugs<br />3:08 Wet Storage Stain<br />3:49 Brown Staining<br /><br />More information regarding the post hot-dip galvanizing coating appearance can be found on the AGA website:  <br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://galvanizeit.org/specification-and-inspection/post-hdg-considerations">https://galvanizeit.org/specification-and-inspection/post-hdg-considerations</a>{% endraw %}
