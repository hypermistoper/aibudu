{% raw %}Headed out winter camping and the snow was starting to melt and was a bit slushy. Ended up stuck in the snow on a forest road. It was clear that I wasn't going to make it any further so I decided to stay overnight right where I was and worry about getting my stuck van out in the morning. Even though it wasn't the location I had on my mind it turned out to be a very nice break after the hecticness of the holidays. I think I need to go out and get stuck more often when I go winter camping.<br />The next morning the temperature had warmed which did have me a bit worried about the snow being even more slushy than the day before which could make backtracking out of the location more difficult. It wasn't hard to get my stuck van out and I was quickly on my way.<br /><br />For links to Primal Outdoors gear and merch see my website<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.primal-outdoors.com">https://www.primal-outdoors.com</a><br /><br />Frequently Asked Questions<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.primal-outdoors.com/faq">https://www.primal-outdoors.com/faq</a><br /><br />Support me through Jackery<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.primal-outdoors.com/jackery">https://www.primal-outdoors.com/jackery</a><br /><br />Your Primal Outdoors - Camping and Overlanding, I am living the van life in my Ford E350 4x4 Van traveling around the remote public land system in Oregon{% endraw %}
