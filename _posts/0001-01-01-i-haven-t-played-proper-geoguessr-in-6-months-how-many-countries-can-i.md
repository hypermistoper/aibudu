{% raw %}I know you hate it when I apologize, but sorry it's a day late, and sorry for the slow pace. Lot of thinking going on in this one.<br /><br />My &quot;NMPZ 10 secs per round&quot; video back in September 2021 was the last time I got stuck in to some serious geoguessr. Since then it's just been relaxing capital city play alongs and novelty satellite games. So with such a lengthy period of time away from the hot seat and minimal meta knowledge to begin with, just how shit have I become? Have those Filipino Palm trees and Greek bushes stuck in my noggin? or did that Welsh farmer chase them out?<br /><br />Want to see my best ever country streak? <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://youtu.be/-GQfpgfFqzA">https://youtu.be/-GQfpgfFqzA</a>{% endraw %}
