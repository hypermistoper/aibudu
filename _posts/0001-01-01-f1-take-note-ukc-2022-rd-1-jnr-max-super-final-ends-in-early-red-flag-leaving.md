{% raw %}The opening round of the Ultimate Karting Championship sees an incident resulting in a red flag thrown by the Race Director that leads to a 4 lap shootout for the prize! eerily similar to F1 at the end of 2021... THIS is how it could have ended between Hamilton and Verstappen.... New tyres for all and a straight 4 lap exciting finish. There was even a big lead at the time that was then nothing at the single file restart!<br /><br />TDi Media use a MiRider One Folding Electric Bike to help us get our kit around the circuit and paddock when filming.
