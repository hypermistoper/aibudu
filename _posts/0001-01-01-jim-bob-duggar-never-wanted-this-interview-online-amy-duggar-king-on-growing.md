{% raw %}#CountingOn<br /><br />This interview is from March 2020 &amp; we were asked to private because Jim Bob did not want this online. We never spoke to Jim Bob, instead he made his feelings known to Amy &amp; her mom. <br /><br />Katie Joy interviewed Amy Duggar King who appeared on &quot;Counting On&quot; and other reality tv. Her family made her famous, but she insists she couldn't be more different than them. <br />Disclaimer:<br /><br /><br />Follow Katie Joy on Social Media:<br /><br />Instagram: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/withoutacrystalball/">https://www.instagram.com/withoutacrystalball/</a><br /><br />Twitter:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/woacbofficial">https://twitter.com/woacbofficial</a><br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://twitter.com/katiejoyyt">https://twitter.com/katiejoyyt</a><br /><br />Facebook:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.facebook.com/withoutacrystalball/">https://www.facebook.com/withoutacrystalball/</a><br /><br />Without a Crystal Ball is a commentary channel.
