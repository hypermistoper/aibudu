For me this chat displays exactly what Baldcafe is about. 1. Alister instinctively referred to Baldcafe as &quot;our channel&quot; and it absolutely is. That moment, as brief as it might have been was fantastic. 2. Alister talks in detail about how dealing with the negativities that balding can throw up not only kept him stagnant in life but actually had him on a downward spiral. Taking full ownership and control of the situation and leaving nothing to chance gave him his mojo back and much more. He is here to further share his thoughts on his journey in the hope it can continue to help others out there. I couldn't be more proud of this man and like Alister I hope it helps some of your out there who are stuck in your own hair loss rut. <br /><br />Thanks for watching<br /><br />If you are struggling with hair loss then read my free ebook here: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://baldcafe.com">https://baldcafe.com</a><br /><br />‚òïÔ∏è Your support for the channel means the world and I am incredibly grateful for all of you that engage positively with the videos and others in the comments.
