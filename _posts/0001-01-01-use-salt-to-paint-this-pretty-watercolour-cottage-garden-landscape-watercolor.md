It's a line and wash painting using Pigma Micron and Faber Castell waterproof fine liners for the linework, and a limited palette of raw and burnt sienna, cobalt blue, burnt umber, sap green, perylene green and alizarin Scarlet lake. <br />I used ordinary fine table salt, various brushes that I found online, but use any brushes you are comfortable with. My board is at an angle of about 45 degrees tilt.<br />My paper is 100% cotton Saunders Waterford, cold pressed, 11&quot; x 15&quot;/28cm x 38cm. Thanks for watching, and happy painting!{% endraw %}
