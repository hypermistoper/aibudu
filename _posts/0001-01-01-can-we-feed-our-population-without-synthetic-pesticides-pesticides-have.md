{% raw %}Pesticides have a bad rep, but they have been instrumental in feeding growing populations through history. However, an increasing numbers of critics and farmers say they have brought about a new, and bigger challenge – poor health and the decimation of biodiversity. Is it realistic, then, to get rid of them and still feed everybody on the planet?<br /><br />We're destroying our environment at an alarming rate. But it doesn't need to be this way. Our new channel Planet A explores the shift towards an eco-friendly world — and challenges our ideas about what dealing with climate change means. We look at the big and the small: What can we do and how the system needs to change. Every Friday we'll take a truly global look at how to get us out of this mess.<br /><br />Author: Aditi Rajagopal <br />Camera and Video Editor: Henning Goll  <br />Supervising Editor: Kiyo Dörrer, Joanna Gottschalk  <br /><br />#PlanetA #Organicfarming #Pesticides <br /><br />Read More:<br />  <br />Feeding the world, protecting the planet: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="http://www.fao.org/3/ca0130en/CA0130EN.pdf">http://www.fao.org/3/ca0130en/CA0130EN.pdf</a> <br /><br />Pesticides and health: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.consumerreports.org/pesticides-in-food/stop-eating-pesticides/">https://www.consumerreports.org/pesticides-in-food/stop-eating-pesticides/</a> <br /><br />The Green Revolution: <a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/green-revolution-norman-borlaug-race-to-fight-global-hunger/">https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/green-revolution-norman-borlaug-race-to-fight-global-hunger/</a>{% endraw %}
