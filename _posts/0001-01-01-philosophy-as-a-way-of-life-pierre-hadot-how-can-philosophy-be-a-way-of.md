{% raw %}How can philosophy be a way of life? Pierre Hadot wrote about ancient Greek and Roman philosophers who approached philosophy with the goal and practice of wisdom. What does this mean for us today? <br /><br />From Hadot’s book, ‘Philosophy as a Way of Life’: <br />“Philosophy was a mode of existing-in-the-world, which had to be practised at each instant, and the goal of which was to transform the whole of the individual's life ... <br />Philosophy was a way of life, both in its exercise and effort to achieve wisdom, and in its goal, wisdom itself. For real wisdom does not merely cause us to know: it makes us &quot;be&quot; in a different way ... <br />Philosophy is a conversion, a transformation of one's way of being and living, and a quest for wisdom.” Ch 11 <br /><br />The School of Philosophy and Economic Science offers courses in practical philosophy and economics with justice as well as other subjects. It aims to approach philosophy in a practical way, encouraging students to apply philosophy in their lives. The School also introduces a mindfulness-type exercise leading eventually to mantra meditation. <br /><br />Enjoyed this video?
