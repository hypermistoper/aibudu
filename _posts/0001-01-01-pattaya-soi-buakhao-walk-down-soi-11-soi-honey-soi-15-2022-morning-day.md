{% raw %}Enjoy daily videos from #Thailand, #Pattaya 2022, from such popular spots as #Walking Street, #Pattaya Beach road, #Soi Buakhao, Tree Town, Thepprasit Market, #Jomtien Beach, #Dongtan Beach, any bars, clubs, massage shops and other spectacular views of this amazing Pattaya. And of course,  about   BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE!!!.<br /><br />That amazing Massage Shop presented in video is &quot;PUI Health Massage&quot; located in Buakhaow Soi 15. <br /><br />I warmly welcome and hello to everyone! This is my latest video from #amazing pattaya 2022. Location of footage is #Pattaya Soi Buakhao. This walking tour began from the #Pattaya Second Road Soi 11 ( also called #Soi Honey ). I just walked down the Soi Honey in the direction to Soi Buakhao. Next location is Buakhaow soi 15. Journey started from behind the Avenue Pattaya or rather from Pui Massage shop, in direction to #Soi Buakao, after that, I walked down Soi Buakhao until Soi 13. Video was taken at 2 phases, Soi Honey in the morning between 09:00 am and 10:00 am and Soi 15 and 13 in daytime about 16:00 pm and 17:00 pm. So Just let's look how things going on in one of the most popular and crowded spots of #Pattaya city these days. Actually everything looks like no more any limitations and like &quot;Pattaya finally reopened, especially for tourists who prefer to sleep at night time, because there are some limitations and restrictions for #a go go, body massage and also Pattaya night clubs in Pattaya city. So, you're welcome again to join my Pattaya walk and let's together take a look at there. And if you like the video, please subscribe to the channel, press LIKE and comment. But in any case An Enormous Thanks to Everyone for Watching Pattaya True Tone channe!
