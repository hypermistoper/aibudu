{% raw %}These were busy times that followed many months without playing to people - very few gigs in 1977. I practised and wrote music for ‘Feels Good to Me’, but it wasn’t until UK launched out on tour in 1978 that I began to get familiar again with night after night behind the drums. We’d been practically living at Trident Studios in Soho, London, producing Feels Good to Me, UK, and One of a Kind. I’m surprised the drumming sounds so confident, because I’d been doing so little of it immediately prior to these albums. <br /><br />Eddie Jobson had recently been in Frank Zappa’s band, and he brought the great man down to the studio for the playback party at the completion of the UK album. You turn the music up loud (it's going to be the first and last time you'll hear the entire album on such a great audio system),  fill the room with friends and record execs, and crack open a bottle of something sparkly. A great night. Frank made nice noises, as I remember, and was the perfect gentleman.{% endraw %}
