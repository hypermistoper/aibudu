The FED has historically lowered their balance sheet and in this video we take a look at the outcome of them doing so.<br /><br />The FED starting a recession is on everyone's mind and it seems like many investors are worried about the FED potentially sending the stock market down. In this video I explain my thoughts.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am NOT a financial advisor, and nothing I say is meant to be a recommendation to buy or sell any financial instrument. I will NEVER ask you to send me money to trade for you. Please report any suspicious emails or fake social media profiles claiming to be me. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose. There are no guarantees or certainties in trading or investing.<br /><br />My videos may contain affiliate links or sponsorship to products I believe will add value to your life and help you. No matter what I or anyone else says, itâ€™s important to do your own research before making a financial decision.<br /><br />See Full Disclaimer Here:<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="blank" href="https://www.danielpronk.com/disclaimer">https://www.danielpronk.com/disclaimer</a>{% endraw %}
